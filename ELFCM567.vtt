Hello, hello, hello, and welcome

00:00:07.803 --> 00:00:09.693
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.693 --> 00:00:12.483
Minds, by Leonardo English, the show

00:00:12.493 --> 00:00:14.233
where you can listen to fascinating

00:00:14.233 --> 00:00:16.663
stories and learn weird and wonderful

00:00:16.673 --> 00:00:18.713
things about the world at the same

00:00:18.713 --> 00:00:20.543
time as improving your English.

00:00:21.093 --> 00:00:23.773
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is

00:00:23.773 --> 00:00:26.093
the start of another three-part

00:00:26.103 --> 00:00:28.523
mini-series, this time on the

00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:31.323
theme of “Young American Outlaws”.

00:00:31.943 --> 00:00:34.233
In this series, we’ll explore the

00:00:34.233 --> 00:00:36.233
lives of young Americans whose

00:00:36.233 --> 00:00:39.263
crimes–or perhaps simply actions–have

00:00:39.263 --> 00:00:41.283
become deeply politicised.

00:00:41.743 --> 00:00:43.763
First up, in today’s episode,

00:00:43.913 --> 00:00:45.853
we’ll talk about Ross Ulbricht,

00:00:46.123 --> 00:00:48.043
the founder of the world’s biggest

00:00:48.053 --> 00:00:50.473
drug marketplace, The Silk Road.

00:00:51.183 --> 00:00:53.213
Next up, we’ll talk about Aaron

00:00:53.213 --> 00:00:55.803
Swartz, the teen prodigy and

00:00:55.843 --> 00:00:57.823
internet freedom activist who

00:00:57.833 --> 00:01:00.354
got on the wrong side of the FBI.

00:01:00.583 --> 00:01:02.833
And then in part three, the final part,

00:01:03.055 --> 00:01:05.123
we will talk about the ongoing case

00:01:05.303 --> 00:01:08.303
of Luigi Mangione, the man accused of

00:01:08.323 --> 00:01:11.583
murdering the CEO of United Healthcare,

00:01:11.873 --> 00:01:13.573
one of the largest health insurance

00:01:13.593 --> 00:01:15.313
providers in the United States.

00:01:16.053 --> 00:01:18.003
OK then, let’s not waste

00:01:18.033 --> 00:01:20.063
another minute and get into the

00:01:20.063 --> 00:01:22.803
amazing story of Ross Ulbricht.

00:01:23.643 --> 00:01:26.160
The professional network LinkedIn

00:01:26.403 --> 00:01:28.453
is not typically a place for

00:01:28.473 --> 00:01:30.523
provocative political statements.

00:01:31.083 --> 00:01:33.573
If you look at someone’s LinkedIn page,

00:01:33.823 --> 00:01:36.243
they might describe themselves as “a

00:01:36.263 --> 00:01:38.893
passionate sales leader with 10+ years

00:01:38.893 --> 00:01:40.883
of experience in the pharmaceutical

00:01:40.883 --> 00:01:44.113
industry”, or “operations manager with

00:01:44.113 --> 00:01:46.903
team leadership experience”, or all manner

00:01:46.913 --> 00:01:49.663
of other, corporate-style sentences.

00:01:51.013 --> 00:01:53.823
In the case of one man, his LinkedIn

00:01:53.823 --> 00:01:56.023
page read slightly differently.

00:01:56.973 --> 00:01:59.843
When FBI officers stumbled across the

00:01:59.843 --> 00:02:02.893
LinkedIn page for one Ross Ulbricht,

00:02:03.253 --> 00:02:06.123
they found it to read, “I want to use

00:02:06.193 --> 00:02:09.023
economic theory as a means to abolish

00:02:09.213 --> 00:02:12.093
the use of coercion and agression amongst

00:02:12.093 --> 00:02:16.063
mankind,” followed by. “To that end, I

00:02:16.063 --> 00:02:18.543
am creating an economic simulation to

00:02:18.543 --> 00:02:21.133
give people a first-hand experience of

00:02:21.133 --> 00:02:23.763
what it would be like to live in a world

00:02:23.933 --> 00:02:26.343
without the systemic use of force.”

00:02:27.593 --> 00:02:30.063
It was an important clue as to the

00:02:30.083 --> 00:02:32.573
identity of the person behind what

00:02:32.573 --> 00:02:34.903
was at the time the world’s largest

00:02:34.983 --> 00:02:37.713
illegal online marketplace for drugs,

00:02:37.993 --> 00:02:41.043
weapons, pornography, and, in fact,

00:02:41.273 --> 00:02:44.133
practically anything: The Silk Road.

00:02:45.233 --> 00:02:47.633
Ulbricht first had the idea for

00:02:47.643 --> 00:02:49.933
such a marketplace shortly after

00:02:49.933 --> 00:02:52.483
finishing university at Penn State.

00:02:53.653 --> 00:02:55.893
He had always been a smart student

00:02:56.093 --> 00:02:58.143
and managed to get excellent

00:02:58.143 --> 00:03:00.273
grades without doing too much work.

00:03:00.803 --> 00:03:03.893
But after graduating, he found

00:03:03.913 --> 00:03:06.343
real life to be not quite as easy.

00:03:07.053 --> 00:03:09.713
He tried day trading, buying and

00:03:09.713 --> 00:03:11.783
selling stocks, as well as starting

00:03:11.783 --> 00:03:14.563
a video game company, but neither

00:03:14.563 --> 00:03:16.643
of those ideas had worked out.

00:03:17.613 --> 00:03:19.813
He then set up an online

00:03:19.843 --> 00:03:21.353
second-hand bookstore with a

00:03:21.353 --> 00:03:23.533
friend, based in Austin, Texas.

00:03:24.203 --> 00:03:26.943
They would buy second-hand books en masse,

00:03:27.433 --> 00:03:30.083
and sell them on other marketplaces.

00:03:31.273 --> 00:03:33.093
It was a moderate success.

00:03:33.393 --> 00:03:36.633
It never made much money, but it did

00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:40.093
teach the then 26-year-old some boring but

00:03:40.113 --> 00:03:43.203
important skills: things like inventory

00:03:43.203 --> 00:03:46.073
management, pricing, customer service, and

00:03:46.353 --> 00:03:49.123
the basics of running an online business.

00:03:50.443 --> 00:03:52.503
And it was while working on this

00:03:52.543 --> 00:03:55.753
project that Ulbricht had another idea.

00:03:56.793 --> 00:03:58.813
It was for a marketplace that would

00:03:58.813 --> 00:04:01.883
provide complete anonymity, allowing

00:04:01.893 --> 00:04:04.183
buyers and sellers to transact

00:04:04.493 --> 00:04:07.026
anonymously, without the website

00:04:07.026 --> 00:04:09.253
or any snooping authorities being

00:04:09.253 --> 00:04:11.643
able to identify anyone involved.

00:04:13.323 --> 00:04:15.713
And this wasn’t just a business

00:04:15.713 --> 00:04:17.963
idea; it was strongly aligned

00:04:18.163 --> 00:04:20.343
with Ulbricht’s political beliefs.

00:04:21.363 --> 00:04:23.613
He was a libertarian and a strong

00:04:23.643 --> 00:04:26.053
admirer of the Austrian philosopher

00:04:26.053 --> 00:04:28.898
and economist Ludwig von Mises.

00:04:29.393 --> 00:04:32.263
The Austrian School of economics argues,

00:04:32.553 --> 00:04:34.733
essentially, that the most effective

00:04:34.763 --> 00:04:37.353
economic system is one based on free

00:04:37.353 --> 00:04:39.913
markets and voluntary exchange, with

00:04:39.923 --> 00:04:41.953
minimal government interference.

00:04:42.693 --> 00:04:46.273
It holds that individuals act rationally

00:04:46.493 --> 00:04:49.073
to pursue their goals, and that central

00:04:49.073 --> 00:04:52.343
planning or state intervention distorts

00:04:52.383 --> 00:04:55.103
prices and leads to inefficiency.

00:04:56.343 --> 00:04:58.493
In other words, the most efficient

00:04:58.493 --> 00:05:01.003
system is one where individuals

00:05:01.173 --> 00:05:03.153
are left to do what they want,

00:05:03.423 --> 00:05:05.723
without any state interference.

00:05:06.993 --> 00:05:09.513
Ulbricht’s idea of a website that allowed

00:05:09.523 --> 00:05:12.553
users complete anonymity fitted right

00:05:12.573 --> 00:05:15.273
in with this political philosophy.

00:05:16.493 --> 00:05:19.223
Now, it wasn’t, and still isn’t,

00:05:19.343 --> 00:05:21.653
particularly difficult to access the

00:05:21.653 --> 00:05:23.743
internet anonymously - there are plenty

00:05:23.743 --> 00:05:26.173
of ways of hiding your IP address

00:05:26.173 --> 00:05:28.603
and so on, so it’s fairly trivial

00:05:28.603 --> 00:05:31.343
to access a website anonymously.

00:05:32.163 --> 00:05:35.193
The problem was related to payments.

00:05:35.783 --> 00:05:37.573
There was no reliable way for

00:05:37.573 --> 00:05:39.473
one stranger to pay another.

00:05:39.863 --> 00:05:41.683
Card transactions could be traced,

00:05:41.933 --> 00:05:43.753
as they were linked to your identity.

00:05:44.393 --> 00:05:46.703
Sending cash through the mail was

00:05:46.893 --> 00:05:49.213
inherently risky, as the recipient

00:05:49.423 --> 00:05:50.593
could claim they didn’t receive

00:05:50.593 --> 00:05:52.813
it, or the sender might claim

00:05:52.833 --> 00:05:54.663
it was sent when it never was.

00:05:55.493 --> 00:05:57.713
And saying “meet me behind this petrol

00:05:57.713 --> 00:05:59.783
station at 10 pm and I’ll hand over

00:05:59.783 --> 00:06:02.393
the cash” wasn’t exactly ideal either.

00:06:03.413 --> 00:06:05.943
But Ulbricht had discovered something

00:06:05.973 --> 00:06:09.153
that solved this problem: Bitcoin.

00:06:10.033 --> 00:06:12.843
Bitcoin, as you probably know, is a

00:06:12.843 --> 00:06:15.803
cryptocurrency that can be sent digitally

00:06:15.983 --> 00:06:18.663
from one address to another without either

00:06:18.673 --> 00:06:21.483
party’s true identity being revealed.

00:06:22.583 --> 00:06:23.903
It was perfect.

00:06:24.183 --> 00:06:27.373
Every transaction was public, so nobody

00:06:27.373 --> 00:06:30.123
could say, “I didn’t get it”, and it

00:06:30.123 --> 00:06:32.943
was also practically anonymous, meaning

00:06:33.143 --> 00:06:35.923
nobody–not the seller, not the buyer,

00:06:36.113 --> 00:06:38.423
not the authorities–nobody would be

00:06:38.433 --> 00:06:40.913
able to see the true identity of the

00:06:40.913 --> 00:06:43.253
individuals involved in the transaction.

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:46.570
Ulbricht got to work building

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:48.350
the first version of the website.

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:51.730
He built it on the Tor network,

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:54.190
which is essentially an encrypted

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:55.880
layer of the internet that makes it

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.780
impossible to trace individual users.

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:02.670
It took him several months, and he

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.510
did it in complete secrecy, telling

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:07.150
only his girlfriend at the time.

00:07:08.516 --> 00:07:11.316
He had a vision for this big marketplace

00:07:11.316 --> 00:07:15.046
where anyone could buy anything, but he

00:07:15.046 --> 00:07:17.966
knew he needed to start with one product.

00:07:18.736 --> 00:07:21.376
Any online marketplace has this

00:07:21.586 --> 00:07:24.566
chicken-and-egg problem: if a buyer

00:07:24.816 --> 00:07:26.336
comes to it and sees there’s nothing

00:07:26.336 --> 00:07:29.326
for sale, they’ll leave, and if there

00:07:29.326 --> 00:07:32.006
are no buyers, then no sellers will

00:07:32.006 --> 00:07:33.866
bother listing anything for sale.

00:07:34.656 --> 00:07:37.736
So, Ulbricht started with something he

00:07:37.736 --> 00:07:40.886
knew there would be demand for: drugs,

00:07:41.306 --> 00:07:44.086
and in particular, magic mushrooms.

00:07:45.356 --> 00:07:47.866
He grew the first mushrooms himself,

00:07:48.176 --> 00:07:51.076
then listed them for sale on his website.

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:53.790
Given that he was going to be

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.300
selling drugs, he couldn’t exactly do

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:59.300
advertising or market his website in

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:02.160
any way, so he had to get creative.

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.010
He posted on a bunch of internet

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:07.990
forums related to drug use, purporting

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.160
to be just a user, with posts

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.540
like “has anyone used this website

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:14.320
Silk Road? Looks interesting.”.

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:18.420
The website went live in February

00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:21.770
of 2011, and soon enough,

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:24.080
the orders came rolling in.

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:27.600
And he was fulfilling them all himself.

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:30.720
Just like he had done with the

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:32.620
second-hand books, he would take

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:35.130
the order, package it up, print off

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:37.730
the address and pop it in the post.

00:08:39.156 --> 00:08:42.659
It started relatively slowly, but sure

00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:45.129
enough, sellers started listing their

00:08:45.189 --> 00:08:49.398
own products for sale: cannabis, MDMA,

00:08:49.459 --> 00:08:51.909
cocaine, heroin, as well as all sorts

00:08:51.909 --> 00:08:54.379
of prescription drugs, available without

00:08:54.399 --> 00:08:55.999
a doctor’s prescription, of course.

00:08:57.249 --> 00:08:59.619
The website was structured in a very

00:08:59.619 --> 00:09:03.109
similar way to a site like eBay or Amazon.

00:09:03.769 --> 00:09:06.089
Sellers could upload pictures of their

00:09:06.089 --> 00:09:08.029
goods, a description of what was for

00:09:08.039 --> 00:09:11.209
sale, and the price, payable in Bitcoin.

00:09:12.697 --> 00:09:15.077
As for buyers, they could scroll

00:09:15.107 --> 00:09:17.227
through the website, perusing different

00:09:17.237 --> 00:09:19.707
drugs, reading reviews and ratings,

00:09:19.997 --> 00:09:21.957
before deciding which one to go for.

00:09:23.243 --> 00:09:25.023
They would make their purchase, in

00:09:25.043 --> 00:09:27.433
Bitcoin of course, then a few days

00:09:27.433 --> 00:09:29.453
or weeks later, they would receive a

00:09:29.493 --> 00:09:31.443
package through the mail which would

00:09:31.453 --> 00:09:33.473
contain the drugs they had ordered.

00:09:34.343 --> 00:09:37.113
They would take the drugs, and then, being

00:09:37.203 --> 00:09:39.413
good internet citizens, they would leave

00:09:39.433 --> 00:09:42.303
a review: “really good batch”, or “the

00:09:42.303 --> 00:09:43.703
pink ones aren’t as strong as the blue

00:09:43.703 --> 00:09:46.343
ones”, or simply, “great communication,

00:09:46.695 --> 00:09:48.403
A+ seller, will buy again!”.

00:09:50.033 --> 00:09:52.813
Now, before we get into any discussion

00:09:52.813 --> 00:09:55.153
of the morality of this, it was

00:09:55.153 --> 00:09:58.443
clearly a very good business: in the

00:09:58.443 --> 00:10:01.393
United States alone, there are 37

00:10:01.393 --> 00:10:04.473
million active illegal drug users.

00:10:05.063 --> 00:10:07.363
And the nature of drug use and drug

00:10:07.363 --> 00:10:09.953
addiction is that it is, almost

00:10:09.963 --> 00:10:12.403
by definition, a repeat purchase.

00:10:12.663 --> 00:10:15.163
Buy, use, buy, use, buy, use.

00:10:16.283 --> 00:10:18.333
The Silk Road facilitated this

00:10:18.353 --> 00:10:20.613
transaction, making ordering whatever

00:10:20.613 --> 00:10:22.953
drug you wanted as easy as clicking

00:10:22.973 --> 00:10:24.783
a few buttons on your computer.

00:10:26.373 --> 00:10:28.863
The website took a fee, of course, which

00:10:29.023 --> 00:10:32.993
ranged from 8 to 15% of the transaction

00:10:32.993 --> 00:10:36.233
value, but for sellers, this was a

00:10:36.253 --> 00:10:38.773
small price to pay for the convenience.

00:10:40.243 --> 00:10:43.623
Later that year, in 2011, the website

00:10:43.693 --> 00:10:46.173
caught the eye of an eager journalist

00:10:46.253 --> 00:10:48.293
at the now-defunct blog Gawker.

00:10:49.543 --> 00:10:51.563
He published an article titled,

00:10:51.993 --> 00:10:53.553
“The Underground Website Where

00:10:53.553 --> 00:10:55.683
You Can Buy Any Drug Imaginable”.

00:10:57.023 --> 00:10:59.143
It led to a flood of interest in the

00:10:59.173 --> 00:11:02.073
site, and other journalists started

00:11:02.073 --> 00:11:03.843
writing up their own articles too.

00:11:05.273 --> 00:11:07.903
All this time, Ulbricht was managing

00:11:07.903 --> 00:11:10.033
the site himself, doing everything

00:11:10.033 --> 00:11:12.763
from fixing bugs to negotiating with

00:11:12.773 --> 00:11:15.363
hackers to providing customer service.

00:11:15.753 --> 00:11:17.743
It was consuming his life,

00:11:18.113 --> 00:11:20.093
and his long-time girlfriend

00:11:20.263 --> 00:11:22.133
decided enough was enough.

00:11:22.793 --> 00:11:24.243
She gave him an ultimatum:

00:11:24.443 --> 00:11:26.393
it’s me or the website.

00:11:27.093 --> 00:11:28.803
Ulbricht chose the website.

00:11:29.863 --> 00:11:32.633
By this time, the Silk Road had become

00:11:32.633 --> 00:11:34.973
more than just a place to buy drugs.

00:11:35.473 --> 00:11:38.043
There was a real sense of community, of

00:11:38.053 --> 00:11:40.103
users being part of something that was

00:11:40.203 --> 00:11:42.523
bigger than a place to buy marijuana.

00:11:43.263 --> 00:11:46.503
This was a true libertarian paradise, a

00:11:46.503 --> 00:11:48.393
place where people were allowed to make

00:11:48.393 --> 00:11:50.843
their own choices about what to buy and

00:11:50.983 --> 00:11:53.023
what to put into their bodies without

00:11:53.033 --> 00:11:54.873
the government poking its nose in.

00:11:56.003 --> 00:11:58.383
Ulbricht was completely happy for people

00:11:58.383 --> 00:12:00.793
to use the website to buy drugs; he

00:12:00.793 --> 00:12:02.683
had smoked a lot of pot as a teenager;

00:12:02.743 --> 00:12:05.503
that was his decision, and he felt

00:12:05.523 --> 00:12:07.963
no responsibility to stop people from

00:12:07.973 --> 00:12:10.273
buying or selling any kind of drug.

00:12:11.723 --> 00:12:14.213
However, as the website got more and

00:12:14.213 --> 00:12:16.693
more popular, he started to see things

00:12:16.703 --> 00:12:19.603
for sale that he found more problematic.

00:12:20.583 --> 00:12:23.293
Guns with scratched-off serial numbers,

00:12:23.303 --> 00:12:25.713
for example, weapons that were clearly

00:12:25.723 --> 00:12:27.988
intended to be used for murder.

00:12:29.683 --> 00:12:31.933
He justified this in the name of

00:12:31.973 --> 00:12:33.993
freedom of choice, of the free

00:12:33.993 --> 00:12:37.413
market, but then things got darker.

00:12:38.683 --> 00:12:40.993
People started to list things like

00:12:41.043 --> 00:12:43.843
child pornography and individuals

00:12:44.003 --> 00:12:46.583
to be sold as sex slaves–things

00:12:46.743 --> 00:12:48.273
that even the most devoted of

00:12:48.273 --> 00:12:51.433
libertarians knew were a step too far.

00:12:52.823 --> 00:12:55.913
These listings would be removed, but it

00:12:55.923 --> 00:12:58.283
wasn’t always particularly easy to do.

00:12:59.733 --> 00:13:02.513
In these cases, sellers would typically

00:13:02.523 --> 00:13:05.143
disguise what was really for sale:

00:13:05.443 --> 00:13:07.383
there would be no direct mention of

00:13:07.673 --> 00:13:10.583
pornography, but instead normal pictures,

00:13:10.803 --> 00:13:14.243
cryptic code, codewords, so it was

00:13:14.263 --> 00:13:16.893
identifiable to a buyer who knew what

00:13:16.893 --> 00:13:19.303
they were looking for, but harder for

00:13:19.313 --> 00:13:21.413
anyone else to know what was going on.

00:13:22.493 --> 00:13:25.093
And, as you might expect, the site

00:13:25.143 --> 00:13:26.563
had garnered the attention of the

00:13:26.563 --> 00:13:30.043
authorities: the FBI, the DEA, and the

00:13:30.043 --> 00:13:32.729
IRS, who were crawling all over it.

00:13:33.673 --> 00:13:35.233
The problem was that

00:13:35.233 --> 00:13:37.083
it seemed unbreakable.

00:13:37.723 --> 00:13:40.153
It was anonymous, you never knew who the

00:13:40.163 --> 00:13:42.773
sellers were, and even if a buyer's home

00:13:42.773 --> 00:13:45.133
address was identified, they could simply

00:13:45.133 --> 00:13:46.803
say they didn’t know anything about the

00:13:46.803 --> 00:13:49.213
package, and it must have been a mistake.

00:13:50.063 --> 00:13:52.873
Being sent drugs in the post, if there is

00:13:52.873 --> 00:13:54.603
no way of proving that you bought them,

00:13:55.003 --> 00:13:57.063
would not stand up in a court of law.

00:13:58.214 --> 00:14:00.884
But while this anonymity made

00:14:00.934 --> 00:14:03.374
prosecutions difficult, it also

00:14:03.404 --> 00:14:05.704
gave federal agents an opening.

00:14:06.754 --> 00:14:09.554
They could pose as Silk Road customers,

00:14:09.774 --> 00:14:12.574
or even sellers, blending into

00:14:12.574 --> 00:14:14.554
the marketplace like anyone else.

00:14:15.294 --> 00:14:18.594
And in so doing, they discovered that the

00:14:18.594 --> 00:14:21.164
person pulling the strings behind it all

00:14:21.484 --> 00:14:24.654
went by the name Dread Pirate Roberts.

00:14:25.504 --> 00:14:28.154
Now, Dread Pirate Roberts isn’t a

00:14:28.154 --> 00:14:30.664
name that came from nowhere; it comes

00:14:30.914 --> 00:14:32.844
from the novel The Princess Bride,

00:14:33.294 --> 00:14:35.304
and is the title that is passed

00:14:35.304 --> 00:14:37.414
down from one person to another.

00:14:38.714 --> 00:14:41.204
It seemed like it was a clever choice

00:14:41.204 --> 00:14:44.254
of pseudonym, meaning that if the user

00:14:44.514 --> 00:14:46.564
acting as Dread Pirate Roberts was

00:14:46.564 --> 00:14:49.414
ever caught, he or she could claim that

00:14:49.414 --> 00:14:51.094
they weren’t the person really behind

00:14:51.094 --> 00:14:53.474
it; they had merely assumed the role.

00:14:54.534 --> 00:14:56.474
Dread Pirate Roberts wasn’t

00:14:56.474 --> 00:14:58.364
a person; it was a title.

00:14:59.737 --> 00:15:03.927
And by the start of 2013, so two

00:15:03.927 --> 00:15:05.997
years into The Silk Road, there were

00:15:06.007 --> 00:15:08.497
federal agents all over the website.

00:15:09.627 --> 00:15:12.577
Some had even gained administrative

00:15:12.577 --> 00:15:15.217
privileges and were helping with customer

00:15:15.237 --> 00:15:18.197
support, while others were simply sitting

00:15:18.197 --> 00:15:20.317
there, watching what was going on.

00:15:21.667 --> 00:15:24.147
But the true identity of Dread

00:15:24.187 --> 00:15:26.457
Pirate Roberts was still a mystery.

00:15:27.697 --> 00:15:31.097
There were a few clues: one agent went

00:15:31.107 --> 00:15:33.297
back to those first posts about the

00:15:33.297 --> 00:15:36.557
Silk Road from 2011, and saw that some

00:15:36.897 --> 00:15:39.487
had come from the username “altoid”.

00:15:41.017 --> 00:15:43.617
Further digging found posts on different

00:15:43.617 --> 00:15:46.374
forums from a user with this username,

00:15:46.877 --> 00:15:48.747
and then one in which he asked a

00:15:48.747 --> 00:15:51.357
programming question about Tor using

00:15:51.357 --> 00:15:54.007
his own name–Ross Ulbricht–before

00:15:54.167 --> 00:15:55.977
quickly changing it to “Frosty”.

00:15:57.897 --> 00:16:01.777
By mid-2013, the authorities were certain

00:16:02.127 --> 00:16:04.667
that Ross Ulbricht was Dread Pirate

00:16:04.667 --> 00:16:07.367
Roberts, but they couldn’t exactly knock

00:16:07.367 --> 00:16:09.867
on his door and ask him politely if he

00:16:09.867 --> 00:16:12.007
was indeed the man behind The Silk Road.

00:16:12.597 --> 00:16:15.277
Yes, he had made some slipups,

00:16:15.427 --> 00:16:17.387
but they knew that he took

00:16:17.417 --> 00:16:19.747
security extremely seriously.

00:16:20.937 --> 00:16:22.737
He would have all sorts of safeguards

00:16:22.737 --> 00:16:25.767
in place so that any evidence linking

00:16:25.767 --> 00:16:27.937
him to The Silk Road would be heavily

00:16:27.947 --> 00:16:30.707
encrypted, and he would probably have

00:16:30.987 --> 00:16:33.597
“kill buttons” on his laptop to delete

00:16:33.647 --> 00:16:35.677
any evidence if he sensed that law

00:16:35.697 --> 00:16:37.907
enforcement authorities were closing in.

00:16:38.937 --> 00:16:41.877
They knew they had to catch him in the

00:16:41.877 --> 00:16:45.237
act, with his laptop open and unlocked.

00:16:46.387 --> 00:16:48.507
In the authorities' favour was

00:16:48.507 --> 00:16:50.477
that he tended to work from public

00:16:50.477 --> 00:16:53.227
places, as using a public WiFi

00:16:53.237 --> 00:16:55.607
network gave him greater deniability.

00:16:56.767 --> 00:16:59.077
Although he had spent much of the

00:16:59.077 --> 00:17:00.827
time he operated the Silk Road

00:17:01.137 --> 00:17:03.307
on the road, travelling in places

00:17:03.307 --> 00:17:05.107
like Southeast Asia, they had

00:17:05.197 --> 00:17:07.517
tracked him down to San Francisco.

00:17:08.967 --> 00:17:14.107
And on 1 October 2013, they pounced.

00:17:15.217 --> 00:17:17.307
He was working on his laptop in a

00:17:17.357 --> 00:17:20.137
quiet area of a public library in a

00:17:20.147 --> 00:17:22.257
residential area of San Francisco.

00:17:23.297 --> 00:17:26.367
He heard people arguing behind him, almost

00:17:26.377 --> 00:17:28.237
like a fight was about to break out.

00:17:29.357 --> 00:17:31.187
He turned around to see what was

00:17:31.197 --> 00:17:34.317
going on, and before he knew it, he

00:17:34.317 --> 00:17:36.447
had been bustled to the ground, his

00:17:36.447 --> 00:17:38.637
laptop snatched away before he had

00:17:38.637 --> 00:17:41.057
time to close the screen or press the

00:17:41.087 --> 00:17:43.237
keyboard shortcut to delete everything.

00:17:44.427 --> 00:17:46.597
It had all been a setup; the

00:17:46.617 --> 00:17:49.047
arguing pair were federal agents.

00:17:50.437 --> 00:17:52.557
He was arrested and charged

00:17:52.607 --> 00:17:54.427
with all manner of crimes.

00:17:55.567 --> 00:17:59.417
The trial started in January of 2015,

00:17:59.877 --> 00:18:01.747
and he stood accused of all sorts

00:18:01.747 --> 00:18:03.607
of things that were more than merely

00:18:03.607 --> 00:18:05.577
running a libertarian marketplace.

00:18:06.467 --> 00:18:09.097
These included money laundering, as well

00:18:09.097 --> 00:18:10.957
as ordering the contract killings of

00:18:10.957 --> 00:18:13.467
five people who had threatened Silk Road.

00:18:14.517 --> 00:18:16.537
Now, I should add that these killings

00:18:16.597 --> 00:18:18.737
didn’t take place; it seemed that

00:18:18.737 --> 00:18:21.187
he'd been scammed, but the prosecution

00:18:21.197 --> 00:18:23.362
alleged that the intent was there.

00:18:23.687 --> 00:18:26.027
He had paid for people to be killed.

00:18:27.227 --> 00:18:30.837
In May of that year, May of 2015, he

00:18:30.837 --> 00:18:33.577
was formally sentenced to double life

00:18:33.597 --> 00:18:35.947
imprisonment without the possibility

00:18:35.947 --> 00:18:39.347
of parole, plus he had to pay back just

00:18:39.377 --> 00:18:43.487
under $200 million from his illicit gains.

00:18:44.317 --> 00:18:46.527
He was only 30 years old.

00:18:47.597 --> 00:18:49.617
Now, when this sentence was

00:18:49.617 --> 00:18:51.537
announced, it was greeted with

00:18:51.537 --> 00:18:53.997
a mixture of horror and praise.

00:18:55.097 --> 00:18:57.697
To his libertarian supporters, he was

00:18:57.697 --> 00:19:01.107
a scapegoat; he had created an online,

00:19:01.357 --> 00:19:03.697
safer version of what people do in

00:19:03.697 --> 00:19:05.937
the real world, and were doing in

00:19:05.937 --> 00:19:08.067
the street outside the San Francisco

00:19:08.067 --> 00:19:10.037
library where he had been arrested.

00:19:10.675 --> 00:19:12.805
He hadn’t forced anyone to buy or

00:19:12.805 --> 00:19:15.615
sell drugs, weapons, or anything.

00:19:16.505 --> 00:19:18.725
And as to the accusations of the

00:19:18.725 --> 00:19:20.975
contract killings, they said these

00:19:20.975 --> 00:19:23.135
had been invented by the authorities.

00:19:24.045 --> 00:19:27.255
But to anti-drug campaigners and many

00:19:27.265 --> 00:19:30.085
politicians, this was a great victory.

00:19:30.945 --> 00:19:32.675
He had made hundreds of millions of

00:19:32.675 --> 00:19:36.075
dollars from drug addiction, violence, and

00:19:36.095 --> 00:19:38.645
by creating a website that enabled some

00:19:38.645 --> 00:19:41.395
of the most vile behaviours imaginable.

00:19:41.935 --> 00:19:44.895
Yes, he was guilty, yes, he knew the

00:19:44.895 --> 00:19:47.875
risks, and yes, he deserved to spend

00:19:47.875 --> 00:19:49.785
the rest of his life behind bars.

00:19:51.395 --> 00:19:53.605
And he would most likely have spent

00:19:53.615 --> 00:19:54.915
the rest of his life in prison

00:19:55.365 --> 00:19:58.375
had he not found an unlikely ally.

00:19:59.805 --> 00:20:04.435
On January 21st, 2025, on his second day

00:20:04.715 --> 00:20:08.145
back in office, Donald Trump gave Ross

00:20:08.145 --> 00:20:11.615
Ulbricht a full and unconditional pardon.

00:20:12.975 --> 00:20:15.515
On the campaign trail, he had promised

00:20:15.525 --> 00:20:17.805
Libertarian voters that he would free

00:20:17.805 --> 00:20:20.255
Ulbricht, and on the day he announced it,

00:20:20.595 --> 00:20:23.355
he posted that, “the scum that worked to

00:20:23.355 --> 00:20:26.105
convict him were some of the same lunatics

00:20:26.285 --> 00:20:27.925
who were involved in the modern-day

00:20:27.925 --> 00:20:30.265
weaponisation of government against me”

00:20:31.795 --> 00:20:34.965
So, today, after 11 years behind

00:20:34.965 --> 00:20:38.275
bars, Ross Ulbricht is a free man.

00:20:39.555 --> 00:20:42.145
His case, and the debate about his

00:20:42.145 --> 00:20:44.285
sentence, became about more than

00:20:44.285 --> 00:20:46.635
him as an individual; it became

00:20:46.645 --> 00:20:48.505
about the role of government, the

00:20:48.515 --> 00:20:50.765
individual’s right to choose, and

00:20:50.765 --> 00:20:52.695
the society we want to live in.

00:20:53.635 --> 00:20:55.885
Where do we draw the line between

00:20:55.925 --> 00:20:58.085
personal freedom to choose and the

00:20:58.085 --> 00:21:00.245
government’s obligation to protect?

00:21:01.025 --> 00:21:03.265
Should someone be punished for building

00:21:03.265 --> 00:21:06.205
the tool, or only for how others use it?

00:21:06.905 --> 00:21:08.925
Was Ulbricht sentenced for what he

00:21:08.935 --> 00:21:11.185
did, or for what he represented?

00:21:12.205 --> 00:21:14.265
In the end, was he a dangerous

00:21:14.265 --> 00:21:16.485
criminal, a victim of the system,

00:21:16.825 --> 00:21:19.305
or its most dangerous critic?

00:21:21.035 --> 00:21:23.535
OK then, that is it for today's episode

00:21:23.565 --> 00:21:25.935
on Ross Ulbricht and The Silk Road.

00:21:26.425 --> 00:21:27.815
As always, I would love

00:21:27.815 --> 00:21:28.655
to know your thoughts.

00:21:29.055 --> 00:21:30.455
Do you think he deserved to

00:21:30.455 --> 00:21:32.265
walk free, or do you think he

00:21:32.265 --> 00:21:33.855
should still be behind bars?

00:21:34.255 --> 00:21:36.815
Just head to community.leonardoenglish.com

00:21:37.095 --> 00:21:38.285
and get chatting away

00:21:38.315 --> 00:21:39.825
with other curious minds.

00:21:40.435 --> 00:21:42.475
And as a final quick reminder, this

00:21:42.475 --> 00:21:44.295
was part one of the mini-series

00:21:44.475 --> 00:21:46.205
on “young American outlaws”.

00:21:46.525 --> 00:21:48.185
Next up, we’ll be talking about

00:21:48.235 --> 00:21:50.375
Aaron Swartz, the boy genius and

00:21:50.375 --> 00:21:52.695
co-founder of Reddit, whose crusade

00:21:52.695 --> 00:21:54.615
for internet freedom brought him up

00:21:54.615 --> 00:21:57.385
against the FBI, and cost him his life.

00:21:57.675 --> 00:21:59.885
And then in part three, we will be talking

00:21:59.885 --> 00:22:02.835
about the current case of Luigi Mangione,

00:22:03.055 --> 00:22:05.095
the young man who stands accused of

00:22:05.125 --> 00:22:07.775
murdering the CEO of one of America’s

00:22:07.785 --> 00:22:09.945
largest healthcare insurance companies.

00:22:10.505 --> 00:22:12.325
