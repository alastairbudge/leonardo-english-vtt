Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:16.260
English, the show where you can listen to fascinating stories and learn weird

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.880
and wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:27.600
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about a man called Percy Fawcett.

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:32.730
You may remember this name from an episode at the start of the year on

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.145
secret, lost civilisations, and if you were listening very carefully

00:00:37.405 --> 00:00:41.285
you might recall I said that this story deserved its own episode.

00:00:41.635 --> 00:00:48.511
And this is it, a story of adventure, exploration, discovery, fearlessness, success

00:00:48.531 --> 00:00:55.171
against all the odds, an unsolved mystery, and the story of a real-life Indiana Jones.

00:00:55.847 --> 00:01:02.177
OK then, let’s get right into it and learn about the story of Percy Fawcett.

00:01:03.827 --> 00:01:06.287
Picture the late 19th century.

00:01:06.967 --> 00:01:13.437
Most maps of the world still had large blank spaces, swathes of “uncharted

00:01:13.437 --> 00:01:18.937
territory” just waiting for someone brave enough—or reckless enough—to fill them in.

00:01:19.937 --> 00:01:23.927
Exploration was the ultimate frontier, and it promised

00:01:23.937 --> 00:01:29.197
fortune, glory, and the chance to write your name into history.

00:01:30.097 --> 00:01:37.207
Into this era stepped Percy Harrison Fawcett: a dashing, determined British explorer

00:01:37.487 --> 00:01:43.877
with an uncanny ability to survive conditions that killed lesser men in days.

00:01:44.996 --> 00:01:52.646
In 1925, at the age of 58, he ventured deep into the Amazon rainforest

00:01:52.886 --> 00:01:59.486
on a quest for what he believed was a lost city—a place he called “Z.”

00:02:00.366 --> 00:02:06.126
But shortly after the journey began, he vanished without a trace,

00:02:06.466 --> 00:02:10.856
leaving behind a mystery that would captivate the world for decades.

00:02:11.796 --> 00:02:18.036
You might remember this story from episode 525, the one on Legendary Lost

00:02:18.046 --> 00:02:22.193
Cities and Civilisations, which came out earlier this year, where we told the

00:02:22.193 --> 00:02:28.413
story of Fawcett within the context of stories about Atlantis and El Dorado.

00:02:29.193 --> 00:02:34.653
Now, the stories of Atlantis and El Dorado deserve their own standalone

00:02:34.653 --> 00:02:39.763
episodes too, but today, it is time for Percy Harrison Fawcett.

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:46.703
To understand how Fawcett came to risk everything for this mythical city, and most

00:02:46.713 --> 00:02:52.953
likely pay the ultimate price, we need to rewind to the earliest chapters of his life.

00:02:53.423 --> 00:02:58.203
Let’s start there: with a young man born into a world that seemed to

00:02:58.213 --> 00:03:03.233
breed explorers as readily as it did aristocrats, often with a very

00:03:03.233 --> 00:03:07.963
fuzzy line between the two, which was the case of Percy Harrison Fawcett.

00:03:09.043 --> 00:03:15.653
He was born in 1867 into a well-to-do British family, Yorkshire gentry that

00:03:15.673 --> 00:03:19.993
had made a lot of money in shipping in the early days of the British empire.

00:03:21.123 --> 00:03:25.943
His father was something of a free spirit—an adventurer,

00:03:26.233 --> 00:03:29.683
a friend to literary figures, and a bit of a gambler.

00:03:30.923 --> 00:03:34.673
It was the sort of life one could lead in Victorian England,

00:03:34.993 --> 00:03:38.673
at least if you were born into a wealthy, aristocratic family.

00:03:39.146 --> 00:03:45.114
There was little concern for “work” in our modern understanding of the word, and such

00:03:45.114 --> 00:03:50.774
families would live off large inheritances passed down from generation to generation.

00:03:51.684 --> 00:03:55.634
So, what did you do as a Victorian aristocrat?

00:03:55.954 --> 00:04:01.522
Well, you could, of course, sit around playing cards, drinking port, and

00:04:01.542 --> 00:04:06.832
gambling your family’s fortune away, as it seemed Percy Fawcett’s father did.

00:04:07.422 --> 00:04:12.872
But you could also develop other interests, and for some, this

00:04:12.912 --> 00:04:17.413
took the form of a fascination with distant corners of the globe.

00:04:18.243 --> 00:04:24.418
Britain was still riding the wave of empire, funding expeditions to map and claim

00:04:24.418 --> 00:04:31.758
territories on nearly every continent, and men who had the nerve for it were in high demand.

00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:36.838
Percy Fawcett would find himself to be one of these men.

00:04:37.994 --> 00:04:43.918
At the age of 17, he was sent to The Royal Military Academy at Woolwich, where he

00:04:43.918 --> 00:04:49.878
reportedly learned “to regard the risk of death as the most piquant sauce to life”.

00:04:51.308 --> 00:04:55.378
After graduating, he was commissioned into the Royal Artillery.

00:04:55.958 --> 00:05:02.078
But he quickly discovered that his talents lay beyond conventional soldiering.

00:05:03.008 --> 00:05:07.578
He had a knack for languages and a taste for the exotic.

00:05:08.053 --> 00:05:15.355
He spent time in Ceylon, modern-day Sri Lanka, Hong Kong, and Malta, and also spent

00:05:15.365 --> 00:05:20.575
time working as a British spy in North Africa, all by his mid-30s, I should add.

00:05:21.305 --> 00:05:27.765
This sense of adventure and a clear talent for existing outside his comfort zone

00:05:28.155 --> 00:05:35.055
almost magnetically drew him to an organisation called the Royal Geographical Society.

00:05:35.995 --> 00:05:41.516
Now, if you look at the Royal Geographical Society’s website today, you’ll find

00:05:41.776 --> 00:05:47.766
that it claims to be “the UK's learned society and professional body for geography”.

00:05:48.803 --> 00:05:52.563
Unless you have a particular passion for geography, this

00:05:52.603 --> 00:05:55.803
might not sound like the most interesting club in the world.

00:05:56.393 --> 00:06:04.163
But 150 years ago, it was in the business of “creating” geography, of sponsoring

00:06:04.343 --> 00:06:10.923
and supporting expeditions to explore, map and understand the natural world.

00:06:11.843 --> 00:06:18.973
It raised money for expeditions in previously uncharted territory and supported the missions of many

00:06:18.993 --> 00:06:25.799
of the explorers we’ve talked about before on this show: David Livingstone’s African missions, Scott

00:06:25.829 --> 00:06:31.459
and Shackleton’s missions to reach the South Pole, and, of course, the research of Charles Darwin.

00:06:32.739 --> 00:06:39.719
For a young man keen on adventure and with a high tolerance for risk, it was a natural home.

00:06:41.124 --> 00:06:45.101
The Royal Geographical Society had its sights set on

00:06:45.101 --> 00:06:49.451
South America and proposed this as an option to Fawcett.

00:06:50.561 --> 00:06:57.231
At the time, large parts of Bolivia, Peru, and Brazil were practically unmapped in the

00:06:57.261 --> 00:07:03.321
eyes of European powers, who were eager to define borders and exploit the land’s resources.

00:07:04.711 --> 00:07:11.651
Fawcett was told by the president of the Society that, and I’m quoting directly, “the terrain

00:07:11.781 --> 00:07:18.181
was all but impassable, it would take up two years and there was no guarantee of survival.”

00:07:19.661 --> 00:07:24.926
What’s more, “disease was rampant, and the local Indians who had been brutally

00:07:24.926 --> 00:07:30.503
and mercilessly attacked by the rubber trappers would kill interlopers on sight.”

00:07:31.989 --> 00:07:37.509
This was, by the way, at the height of the rubber boom, so what the president of

00:07:37.509 --> 00:07:43.124
the society was referring to was the fact that native tribes were now so used to

00:07:43.224 --> 00:07:48.354
outsiders encroaching on their territory and trying to claim it for themselves

00:07:48.624 --> 00:07:54.884
that outsiders would typically be greeted by a storm of poison darts and arrows.

00:07:55.204 --> 00:07:57.584
They were not given a warm welcome.

00:07:58.414 --> 00:08:02.784
So, given all of this, was Fawcett interested in the job?

00:08:03.604 --> 00:08:04.214
Interested?

00:08:04.624 --> 00:08:06.944
He thought it was his life’s calling.

00:08:07.134 --> 00:08:09.454
It was what he had been put on this Earth to do.

00:08:10.854 --> 00:08:15.894
His first mission was in 1906, and he amazed everyone

00:08:16.194 --> 00:08:20.114
by returning intact and a year ahead of schedule.

00:08:21.334 --> 00:08:26.814
Not only had he managed it, but he had got the bug, he loved every minute

00:08:26.884 --> 00:08:32.306
of it, and as soon as he returned to London, he wanted to go straight back.

00:08:33.484 --> 00:08:38.144
It didn’t take long for his fame to grow, and he became renowned

00:08:38.294 --> 00:08:42.444
for his skill in surveying these rugged, remote regions.

00:08:43.193 --> 00:08:48.608
He'd tramp through mosquito infested jungles   with bundles of maps and a

00:08:48.878 --> 00:08:54.218
theodolite, a type of instrument used for surveying territory and measuring angles.

00:08:54.982 --> 00:09:00.452
Undeterred by this incredibly hostile territory, he would calmly record

00:09:00.452 --> 00:09:05.522
latitudes and longitudes in areas where few outsiders had ever ventured.

00:09:06.702 --> 00:09:13.872
And with every mission he went on, slowly but surely, more areas of the map would get filled in.

00:09:15.462 --> 00:09:19.042
And stories of his exploits spread quickly.

00:09:19.669 --> 00:09:25.409
He claimed to have shot enormous 20-metre-long anacondas, to have encountered

00:09:25.439 --> 00:09:31.029
tribes that no other European had seen, and to have a near-superhuman

00:09:31.029 --> 00:09:36.819
resistance to the fevers and diseases that ravaged his fellow explorers.

00:09:38.039 --> 00:09:44.069
Other men would get struck down within days or even hours of setting foot into the Amazon.

00:09:44.589 --> 00:09:50.919
They would be consumed by flesh-eating maggots or larvae, they would be blinded by little worms,

00:09:51.099 --> 00:09:56.759
there were all manner of diseases and threats that killed or crippled his travelling companions.

00:09:57.399 --> 00:09:59.727
But not Fawcett.

00:10:00.469 --> 00:10:06.959
For some reason, he simply didn’t get ill, or at least never seriously ill.

00:10:07.813 --> 00:10:10.414
He also seemed never to tire.

00:10:11.148 --> 00:10:16.778
When the going got tough, and his party hadn’t eaten for several days or

00:10:16.998 --> 00:10:21.278
someone was suffering from a disease, he wouldn’t let them lie down to rest.

00:10:22.126 --> 00:10:27.266
Lying down was giving up, he knew that every time a sick or

00:10:27.266 --> 00:10:31.976
tired man lay down to rest, it was harder to get back up again.

00:10:32.618 --> 00:10:36.637
If you died, Fawcett said, you died standing up.

00:10:37.934 --> 00:10:42.694
Some believed he exaggerated his exploits for fame, but

00:10:42.974 --> 00:10:48.024
many saw him as the real deal—a man born to explore.

00:10:49.504 --> 00:10:53.214
As was the norm with Victorian explorers, he recorded

00:10:53.264 --> 00:10:57.084
everything in a diary, and published it on his return.

00:10:57.994 --> 00:11:04.614
With every new publication his fame grew, and while he was away on a mission, Victorian

00:11:04.614 --> 00:11:10.314
England awaited his return and the tales of mystery and adventure that he would come back with.

00:11:11.654 --> 00:11:15.434
Along the way, there were rumours that he had never really left

00:11:15.464 --> 00:11:19.834
the secret service, and that he was still working as a British spy.

00:11:20.824 --> 00:11:24.884
Mapping distant frontiers, after all, was often as

00:11:24.924 --> 00:11:28.144
politically useful as it was scientifically exciting.

00:11:29.164 --> 00:11:35.672
Yet for Fawcett, there seemed to be something more profound than mere mapmaking.

00:11:36.764 --> 00:11:43.114
In his conversations with indigenous communities, he heard tales of a great city hidden

00:11:43.114 --> 00:11:49.414
far into the rainforest, a place filled with monumental architecture and advanced culture.

00:11:50.344 --> 00:11:55.734
Local lore described it in hushed tones—this was no simple

00:11:55.744 --> 00:12:00.394
village of huts, but something far older, far grander.

00:12:01.794 --> 00:12:08.274
It initially seemed like folklore, a tale passed down through generations, but then

00:12:08.644 --> 00:12:13.694
he found it mentioned in a manuscript in the National Library in Rio de Janeiro.

00:12:14.714 --> 00:12:22.474
The more he looked, the more clues seemed to point to the existence of this city he called Z.

00:12:23.644 --> 00:12:30.084
And, what’s more, Machu Picchu was discovered high in the hills of Peru in 1911.

00:12:31.084 --> 00:12:36.154
Fawcett took this as yet more evidence that the jungles and mountains

00:12:36.154 --> 00:12:40.264
of South America held secrets that were yet to be discovered.

00:12:41.014 --> 00:12:44.784
And somewhere, deep in the Amazon, was Z.

00:12:45.914 --> 00:12:50.264
He became convinced that if he could find such a city, it would

00:12:50.264 --> 00:12:54.714
rewrite what the world believed about human civilisation in the Amazon.

00:12:55.724 --> 00:13:02.312
Now, this was in the early 20th century, and just as his obsession was

00:13:02.322 --> 00:13:07.842
reaching a fever pitch, Europe descended into the chaos of the First World War.

00:13:09.052 --> 00:13:13.850
Fawcett at this time was nearly fifty years old, hardly the

00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:17.420
age at which one typically enlists for frontline service.

00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:23.390
Nevertheless, he had a deep sense of patriotism, he had extensive military

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:28.297
and leadership experience, and he believed his country needed him.

00:13:29.417 --> 00:13:30.747
He was probably right.

00:13:31.487 --> 00:13:36.017
He returned to Britain, traded his machete and compass for an

00:13:36.027 --> 00:13:40.907
officer’s uniform, and headed into the trenches of northern France.

00:13:42.307 --> 00:13:45.577
The horrors he witnessed there changed him forever.

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:51.099
Young men—boys, really—were being sent “over the top” into a

00:13:51.099 --> 00:13:56.328
maelstrom of machine-gun fire, poison gas, and artillery barrages.

00:13:57.828 --> 00:14:02.428
It was a grim lesson in how “civilised” nations could turn

00:14:02.428 --> 00:14:07.278
technology and organisation into instruments of mass destruction.

00:14:08.598 --> 00:14:14.287
Amid the mud, blood, and sheer senselessness of it all, Fawcett

00:14:14.527 --> 00:14:19.217
began to question the supposed superiority of Western progress.

00:14:20.227 --> 00:14:25.707
If this was what civilisation had to offer, was it truly more

00:14:25.737 --> 00:14:29.567
advanced than the tribal societies he had encountered in the Amazon?

00:14:30.897 --> 00:14:35.841
During those long, haunted nights on the Western Front, his mind

00:14:35.871 --> 00:14:41.081
drifted back to the lush green canopy of South America, to the gentle

00:14:41.091 --> 00:14:46.141
currents of unknown rivers, and to the stories of that hidden city.

00:14:46.771 --> 00:14:52.381
Perhaps, he mused, the true measure of civilisation wasn’t bombs and

00:14:52.381 --> 00:14:58.801
factories, and industrial output, but wisdom and harmony—qualities

00:14:59.041 --> 00:15:03.231
that might lie undiscovered beneath the rainforest’s thick foliage.

00:15:04.111 --> 00:15:10.411
Unlike a large proportion of the young men he commanded, Fawcett survived the Somme.

00:15:11.581 --> 00:15:17.061
And when the war ended, he wasted no time returning to his life’s mission.

00:15:18.251 --> 00:15:23.171
Now in his late fifties, hardly an age most men would choose to slog

00:15:23.201 --> 00:15:27.877
through dense undergrowth in searing heat, he was more determined than ever.

00:15:28.477 --> 00:15:33.537
He returned, first in 1920, but the mission was a failure.

00:15:34.344 --> 00:15:39.209
Bad weather conspired against him, and the now 53-year-old

00:15:39.459 --> 00:15:43.345
wasn’t quite as young and nimble as he had been 15 years before.

00:15:44.194 --> 00:15:50.044
Plus, his legendary resistance to tropical disease seemed to be weakening.

00:15:50.774 --> 00:15:55.481
He fell ill, too ill to continue the mission, and had to return to England.

00:15:56.851 --> 00:15:59.711
But if you had thought this would have been enough

00:15:59.781 --> 00:16:03.291
to put him off for life, well, you would be wrong.

00:16:03.951 --> 00:16:11.081
For Fawcett this was a temporary setback, and he soon started planning another mission.

00:16:11.792 --> 00:16:14.712
The problem was that he didn’t have the money to do it.

00:16:15.682 --> 00:16:20.322
Although he was what we would probably call a celebrity explorer by this

00:16:20.342 --> 00:16:25.079
point, he didn’t find it easy to find anyone willing to pay for the trip.

00:16:26.049 --> 00:16:30.329
The Royal Geographical Society had mixed feelings about further

00:16:30.329 --> 00:16:36.394
expeditions; by then, Fawcett had a reputation as something of a maverick,

00:16:36.644 --> 00:16:41.544
difficult to control, and past his prime as an Amazonian explorer.

00:16:42.644 --> 00:16:44.427
Yet he managed it.

00:16:44.984 --> 00:16:49.344
He managed to secure just enough funding, some from newspaper

00:16:49.344 --> 00:16:53.566
deals and some from private backers, to return to the Amazon.

00:16:54.612 --> 00:17:01.142
His plan was straightforward and audacious: travel into uncharted territory,

00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:07.005
gather fresh evidence, and come out triumphant—maybe with gold, maybe

00:17:07.005 --> 00:17:11.685
with tales of a living civilisation beyond the scope of imagination.

00:17:12.781 --> 00:17:18.391
Some people called him delusional; others saw him as a visionary.

00:17:19.701 --> 00:17:25.861
Fawcett himself was unwavering, but he decided not to make the journey alone.

00:17:26.611 --> 00:17:31.831
He recruited his son, Jack, along with Jack’s friend, a young man named Raleigh Rimell.

00:17:32.661 --> 00:17:38.907
They set off in 1925, going up rivers, cutting through dense jungle, and

00:17:39.137 --> 00:17:44.596
negotiating passage with tribes that had  rarely, if ever—encountered outsiders.

00:17:45.506 --> 00:17:47.776
For a while, all went well.

00:17:48.396 --> 00:17:53.506
Fawcett sent intermittent updates via runners who carried letters back to the

00:17:53.526 --> 00:17:58.646
edges of the jungle, where telegraphs could relay his words to the wider world.

00:17:59.313 --> 00:18:02.695
He sounded enthusiastic, confident, even.

00:18:04.135 --> 00:18:07.125
Soon, though, the messages stopped.

00:18:08.305 --> 00:18:13.804
In his last known letter, written about a month into the journey, Fawcett

00:18:14.074 --> 00:18:19.024
described how they were about to push into completely uncharted territory.

00:18:20.184 --> 00:18:23.163
After that point, nothing more was heard.

00:18:24.174 --> 00:18:28.954
He, Jack, and Rimell effectively vanished.

00:18:29.644 --> 00:18:31.994
No one knows exactly what happened.

00:18:32.804 --> 00:18:36.934
Some guess they succumbed to disease or starvation.

00:18:37.606 --> 00:18:41.436
Others suspect they ran afoul of a hostile tribe.

00:18:42.285 --> 00:18:47.875
A few spin wilder theories: that Fawcett discovered Z, decided

00:18:47.885 --> 00:18:51.935
to stay, and purposefully vanished from Western civilisation.

00:18:53.145 --> 00:18:56.825
Their disappearance ignited a feverish obsession.

00:18:57.405 --> 00:19:02.635
Adventurers from around the globe tried to retrace Fawcett’s steps.

00:19:03.505 --> 00:19:06.515
And many didn’t make it out of the Amazon.

00:19:07.515 --> 00:19:13.075
An estimated 100 explorers died or disappeared themselves in the search

00:19:13.085 --> 00:19:18.235
for the British trio, so many that by the 1930s, the Brazilian government

00:19:18.315 --> 00:19:22.654
banned further attempts to find him, fearing the toll on human life.

00:19:24.014 --> 00:19:30.564
And over the decades, rumours spread: bones were found here or

00:19:30.564 --> 00:19:35.324
there, or a tribe told stories of a tall white-haired stranger.

00:19:36.254 --> 00:19:41.994
But no definitive proof of Fawcett’s fate has ever come to light.

00:19:42.934 --> 00:19:46.524
Despite the countless expeditions launched to uncover

00:19:46.534 --> 00:19:50.194
the truth, Fawcett’s remains have never been identified.

00:19:51.104 --> 00:19:55.194
Whatever happened to him, the Amazon has guarded her secrets well.

00:19:56.714 --> 00:20:01.584
And, in a sense, Fawcett’s obsession may not have been in vain.

00:20:02.064 --> 00:20:03.114
He might have been right.

00:20:03.985 --> 00:20:07.855
Recent archaeological studies have revealed that parts of the Amazon

00:20:08.065 --> 00:20:12.590
once supported large, complex societies, lending credibility to the idea

00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:17.950
that advanced civilisations could exist there, hidden from outside eyes.

00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:23.756
Though Fawcett never returned to prove the existence of “Z,” his conviction

00:20:23.756 --> 00:20:28.436
that the region was more than just a green desert was remarkably prescient.

00:20:29.846 --> 00:20:35.356
Today, Percy Fawcett is often called “the real-life Indiana Jones,” a

00:20:35.356 --> 00:20:39.800
moniker that suits his larger-than-life persona and daring exploits.

00:20:40.418 --> 00:20:45.856
Clearly, he was a fascinating character but was full of contradictions.

00:20:46.496 --> 00:20:50.256
An imperial agent but an open-minded explorer.

00:20:50.738 --> 00:20:57.197
A Victorian aristocrat, but one who started to question the superiority of European civilisation.

00:20:58.007 --> 00:21:04.367
An apparently loving husband and father, but one who took his oldest son to his death.

00:21:05.737 --> 00:21:11.557
A man who knew full-well that he might not return from the mission, but went anyway.

00:21:12.547 --> 00:21:16.587
So, let me leave you with a quote widely attributed to Percy

00:21:16.587 --> 00:21:20.887
Fawcett, which seems to sum up his attitude rather well.

00:21:22.148 --> 00:21:28.458
“ It should be remembered that the difficulties are great and the tale of disasters a long

00:21:28.458 --> 00:21:35.558
one, for the few remaining unknown corners of the world exact a price for their secrets.”

00:21:37.228 --> 00:21:43.088
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Percy Harrison Fawcett, a man I hope

00:21:43.088 --> 00:21:47.898
you will agree most certainly deserves the title of a real-life Indiana Jones.

00:21:48.368 --> 00:21:51.368
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:21:51.897 --> 00:21:55.952
I think these ones on Adventurers are some of the most fun episodes we make,

00:21:56.272 --> 00:22:00.442
and if you’d like to listen to more of them, then we have that one on Atlantis

00:22:00.472 --> 00:22:05.952
and El Dorado, that’s episode number 525, but we also have a bunch more.

00:22:06.402 --> 00:22:11.772
From attempts to find the north and south poles to a three-part mini-series on the search

00:22:11.782 --> 00:22:15.592
for the source of the Nile, we've got loads that you might not have listened to yet.

00:22:15.982 --> 00:22:19.802
The easiest way to find them is probably on our website, where you

00:22:19.802 --> 00:22:23.952
can search for episodes with the tag “adventure” or “exploration”.

00:22:24.398 --> 00:22:28.490
I’ll put a link in the description so you can just click on that and go straight there.

00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:34.130
You've been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo English.

00:22:34.493 --> 00:22:40.103
I'm Alastair Budge, you stay safe, and I'll catch you in the next episode.
