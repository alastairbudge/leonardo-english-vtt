Hello, hello, hello, and welcome

00:00:07.783 --> 00:00:09.753
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.753 --> 00:00:12.613
Minds, by Leonardo English, the show

00:00:12.613 --> 00:00:14.283
where you can listen to fascinating

00:00:14.283 --> 00:00:16.683
stories and learn weird and wonderful

00:00:16.693 --> 00:00:18.773
things about the world at the same

00:00:18.773 --> 00:00:20.683
time as improving your English.

00:00:21.253 --> 00:00:24.083
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we

00:00:24.103 --> 00:00:26.223
are going to be talking about water.

00:00:26.613 --> 00:00:29.163
And more specifically, we’ll be talking

00:00:29.173 --> 00:00:31.593
about the most popular YouTuber in

00:00:31.593 --> 00:00:34.793
the world, MrBeast, and what has been

00:00:34.793 --> 00:00:37.443
called “the global water crisis”.

00:00:37.943 --> 00:00:40.983
It’s a story of celebrity, politics,

00:00:41.253 --> 00:00:43.813
geography, poverty, mismanagement,

00:00:44.113 --> 00:00:46.393
technology, and the liquid that

00:00:46.423 --> 00:00:48.863
every human needs to survive.

00:00:49.655 --> 00:00:53.055
OK then, let’s get right into it, and talk

00:00:53.065 --> 00:00:56.485
about MrBeast and the global water crisis.

00:00:57.885 --> 00:01:01.985
In November of 2023, the world’s most

00:01:01.995 --> 00:01:04.525
popular YouTuber, Jimmy Donaldson,

00:01:04.825 --> 00:01:06.755
a man you are more likely to know by

00:01:06.755 --> 00:01:10.135
the name “MrBeast”, released a video

00:01:10.445 --> 00:01:14.325
titled “I Built 100 Wells in Africa.”

00:01:15.065 --> 00:01:18.575
It went instantly viral, and as of

00:01:18.575 --> 00:01:21.225
the time of recording, it has racked

00:01:21.225 --> 00:01:25.075
up over a quarter of a billion views.

00:01:26.305 --> 00:01:29.365
In the video, you see MrBeast and

00:01:29.365 --> 00:01:32.115
his team standing in villages across

00:01:32.135 --> 00:01:35.255
Kenya, Zimbabwe, Uganda, Cameroon,

00:01:35.265 --> 00:01:38.185
and Somalia, unveiling freshly built

00:01:38.205 --> 00:01:41.385
wells surrounded by cheering crowds.

00:01:41.865 --> 00:01:44.255
There are smiling children, colourful

00:01:44.255 --> 00:01:46.545
celebrations, and people clapping

00:01:46.855 --> 00:01:49.775
as clean water gushes out from

00:01:49.775 --> 00:01:51.735
a tap for the very first time.

00:01:52.505 --> 00:01:55.745
The tone of the video is upbeat and

00:01:55.755 --> 00:01:57.935
dramatic–this is a channel known

00:01:57.935 --> 00:02:00.515
for spectacle, after all–but the

00:02:00.515 --> 00:02:03.695
message is clear: access to water

00:02:04.035 --> 00:02:07.145
is life-changing, life-saving, even.

00:02:08.465 --> 00:02:11.205
Before, as you see in the video, these

00:02:11.205 --> 00:02:14.075
communities had to trudge for hours

00:02:14.095 --> 00:02:16.875
every day to get water, often across

00:02:16.875 --> 00:02:20.015
mountains, rivers, and dangerous terrain.

00:02:20.815 --> 00:02:23.475
And even after all this, it was

00:02:23.485 --> 00:02:26.995
often contaminated, dirty water that

00:02:26.995 --> 00:02:29.605
would make them sick, even kill them.

00:02:30.375 --> 00:02:33.415
Clearly, a pretty terrible situation, and

00:02:33.415 --> 00:02:36.625
a small insight into the reality of the

00:02:36.655 --> 00:02:39.715
estimated 1,000 children under the age

00:02:39.715 --> 00:02:43.145
of five who die every single day through

00:02:43.145 --> 00:02:46.015
diseases related to a lack of clean water.

00:02:47.405 --> 00:02:50.305
But after the arrival of this

00:02:50.335 --> 00:02:52.465
American YouTuber and his crew,

00:02:52.955 --> 00:02:55.545
beautiful fresh drinking water could

00:02:55.545 --> 00:02:58.095
be pumped from the ground, for free.

00:02:59.617 --> 00:03:02.315
MrBeast claimed that these wells

00:03:02.525 --> 00:03:04.795
would provide water for half a

00:03:04.795 --> 00:03:07.505
million people and, with the proper

00:03:07.505 --> 00:03:10.335
maintenance, could last for 30 years.

00:03:11.485 --> 00:03:13.495
The video was made in the classic

00:03:13.495 --> 00:03:15.705
MrBeast style: over-the-top

00:03:15.765 --> 00:03:17.875
animations, short and punchy.

00:03:18.365 --> 00:03:20.925
But it was one of his more serious

00:03:20.935 --> 00:03:24.135
subjects, and the comment section was

00:03:24.135 --> 00:03:26.295
flooded with people congratulating him,

00:03:26.555 --> 00:03:29.705
saying what a good thing he had done, and

00:03:29.965 --> 00:03:32.055
how this was a much more worthwhile use

00:03:32.055 --> 00:03:34.585
of his time than giving people money for

00:03:34.625 --> 00:03:37.295
staying in a circle or pressing buttons.

00:03:38.055 --> 00:03:40.165
After all, what happened was

00:03:40.625 --> 00:03:43.595
uplifting, inspiring, hopeful.

00:03:44.585 --> 00:03:48.185
And, if this meant that 500,000 people

00:03:48.475 --> 00:03:50.855
who previously didn’t have clean water

00:03:51.235 --> 00:03:54.235
now had it, surely this was a good thing?

00:03:55.425 --> 00:03:57.795
But, as you might imagine, it

00:03:57.795 --> 00:04:00.085
rubbed some people up the wrong way.

00:04:00.605 --> 00:04:03.365
And it raised some important questions.

00:04:04.095 --> 00:04:06.165
Why did it take a YouTuber

00:04:06.565 --> 00:04:07.735
to solve this problem?

00:04:08.335 --> 00:04:10.785
Why does a man who made his name

00:04:11.095 --> 00:04:13.465
giving away Lamborghinis and filming

00:04:13.495 --> 00:04:16.065
last-man-standing challenges now

00:04:16.065 --> 00:04:18.285
find himself doing something that

00:04:18.285 --> 00:04:21.675
you might think governments, NGOs,

00:04:21.675 --> 00:04:23.475
or international institutions

00:04:23.785 --> 00:04:25.845
should have done a long time ago?

00:04:26.835 --> 00:04:29.305
And, as we’ll come to discuss later on,

00:04:29.835 --> 00:04:32.225
is he actually solving anything at all?

00:04:33.555 --> 00:04:37.335
So, to the first set of questions, why

00:04:37.365 --> 00:04:40.265
did it take a celebrity YouTuber to solve

00:04:40.265 --> 00:04:43.165
this problem and why did these villages

00:04:43.345 --> 00:04:46.165
not have pumps like this many years ago?

00:04:46.922 --> 00:04:48.742
We’re not talking about high-speed

00:04:48.752 --> 00:04:51.742
internet or access to university education

00:04:51.742 --> 00:04:54.032
or cutting-edge cancer treatments.

00:04:54.392 --> 00:04:56.282
We’re talking about water, the most

00:04:56.312 --> 00:04:58.742
basic of basic needs, something

00:04:58.742 --> 00:05:00.772
that no human being can live

00:05:00.812 --> 00:05:02.332
more than a few days without.

00:05:03.182 --> 00:05:04.932
And what’s more, something that

00:05:04.932 --> 00:05:06.922
covers most of the Earth’s surface,

00:05:07.122 --> 00:05:09.962
literally falls from the sky, and

00:05:10.182 --> 00:05:11.722
when it doesn’t come from the sky,

00:05:12.092 --> 00:05:14.512
can be just a few metres below ground.

00:05:15.462 --> 00:05:17.852
After all, the wells MrBeast

00:05:17.912 --> 00:05:19.792
built weren’t high-tech.

00:05:20.092 --> 00:05:22.582
They don’t involve AI, space

00:05:22.582 --> 00:05:24.832
rockets or sophisticated computing.

00:05:25.222 --> 00:05:26.962
They’re just… wells.

00:05:27.322 --> 00:05:30.482
They tap into groundwater — the water

00:05:30.702 --> 00:05:33.072
stored beneath the earth’s surface — and

00:05:33.332 --> 00:05:35.722
bring it up to the surface where it can

00:05:35.722 --> 00:05:38.682
be used for drinking, washing, farming,

00:05:38.682 --> 00:05:40.972
and whatever else it might be needed for.

00:05:42.228 --> 00:05:45.602
Groundwater already existed in most

00:05:45.612 --> 00:05:48.062
of the places he visited, and it

00:05:48.062 --> 00:05:50.452
isn’t particularly complicated or

00:05:50.622 --> 00:05:53.052
expensive to bring it up to the surface.

00:05:54.192 --> 00:05:57.212
What was missing wasn’t the water; it

00:05:57.212 --> 00:05:59.442
was the infrastructure, the funding,

00:05:59.742 --> 00:06:02.392
and the political will to access it.

00:06:03.582 --> 00:06:06.952
This video, and the entire well-digging

00:06:06.972 --> 00:06:09.262
project, highlighted just a few

00:06:09.262 --> 00:06:12.232
examples of what some journalists and

00:06:12.232 --> 00:06:15.742
NGOs call the “global water crisis”,

00:06:16.162 --> 00:06:19.122
the reality that today an estimated

00:06:19.242 --> 00:06:22.992
two billion people still lack access

00:06:23.202 --> 00:06:25.432
to safely managed drinking water.

00:06:26.962 --> 00:06:28.792
Of course, there are many reasons

00:06:28.792 --> 00:06:31.192
for this, and the water crisis looks

00:06:31.192 --> 00:06:33.402
different depending on where you are.

00:06:34.452 --> 00:06:37.602
But most of the problems can be grouped

00:06:37.852 --> 00:06:41.972
into four very broad buckets: geography,

00:06:42.662 --> 00:06:46.512
money, mismanagement, and neglect.

00:06:47.282 --> 00:06:50.432
Again, this is a simplification, and there

00:06:50.432 --> 00:06:52.482
isn’t always a neat and tidy division

00:06:52.702 --> 00:06:55.562
between these buckets, but it’s a useful

00:06:55.562 --> 00:06:57.242
way of thinking about the problem.

00:06:58.402 --> 00:07:00.702
So, first, geography.

00:07:01.632 --> 00:07:03.822
In some parts of the world, clearly,

00:07:04.172 --> 00:07:07.422
water is naturally scarce: for every

00:07:07.422 --> 00:07:09.132
person looking out of their kitchen

00:07:09.132 --> 00:07:11.882
window in northern Scotland wishing it

00:07:11.882 --> 00:07:13.852
would stop raining, there is another

00:07:14.152 --> 00:07:15.682
somewhere else in the world who

00:07:15.682 --> 00:07:17.722
would be over the moon to look out of

00:07:17.722 --> 00:07:19.712
their window and see the same thing.

00:07:20.852 --> 00:07:23.842
The oft-used example is Yemen, which

00:07:23.842 --> 00:07:26.632
gets an average of 17 cm of rain

00:07:26.632 --> 00:07:28.912
a year: about what some parts of

00:07:28.912 --> 00:07:31.632
the UK might get in a single month.

00:07:32.252 --> 00:07:35.652
But unlike the UK, Yemen doesn’t

00:07:35.672 --> 00:07:37.692
have the infrastructure to store

00:07:37.852 --> 00:07:39.682
and distribute water effectively.

00:07:40.302 --> 00:07:43.222
Its capital, Sana’a, is running out

00:07:43.232 --> 00:07:45.792
of water entirely, and some wells

00:07:46.012 --> 00:07:47.872
are now over a kilometre deep.

00:07:48.672 --> 00:07:50.442
There’s also another problem with

00:07:50.442 --> 00:07:52.682
water in Yemen, which has nothing

00:07:52.682 --> 00:07:54.672
to do with geography and everything

00:07:54.672 --> 00:07:56.566
to do with mismanagement, but

00:07:56.732 --> 00:07:58.032
we’ll come to that in a minute.

00:07:59.572 --> 00:08:02.392
In other places, water might exist,

00:08:02.682 --> 00:08:05.542
either underground or in seasonal rivers,

00:08:05.682 --> 00:08:08.292
but not in the right place at the right

00:08:08.292 --> 00:08:11.252
time, and without the proper facilities

00:08:11.262 --> 00:08:14.092
to store it, it simply gets washed away.

00:08:15.102 --> 00:08:18.432
The second bucket is money – having

00:08:18.432 --> 00:08:21.072
the funds to pay for the infrastructure

00:08:21.082 --> 00:08:23.692
required, whether that’s basic wells,

00:08:23.982 --> 00:08:26.482
water storage facilities, or more

00:08:26.482 --> 00:08:28.512
technologically advanced equipment

00:08:28.642 --> 00:08:30.642
like desalination facilities,

00:08:30.852 --> 00:08:33.192
where seawater is processed and

00:08:33.192 --> 00:08:35.462
turned into clean, drinkable water.

00:08:36.592 --> 00:08:39.092
The irony is that often the cost

00:08:39.302 --> 00:08:42.242
to access clean water is very low.

00:08:43.282 --> 00:08:45.412
In places where there is plentiful

00:08:45.442 --> 00:08:47.672
groundwater–like in the areas in

00:08:47.672 --> 00:08:50.772
MrBeast’s video–the water is often just

00:08:50.772 --> 00:08:53.412
a few dozen metres below the surface.

00:08:54.032 --> 00:08:56.462
It’s there, and all you need

00:08:56.662 --> 00:08:58.132
is to drill down and get it.

00:08:59.302 --> 00:09:01.482
But drilling costs money.

00:09:01.592 --> 00:09:02.572
Equipment costs money.

00:09:02.892 --> 00:09:05.552
Pipes, pumps, filters; all

00:09:05.582 --> 00:09:07.632
of this requires investment.

00:09:08.382 --> 00:09:11.002
Not a huge amount of money, but

00:09:11.352 --> 00:09:13.222
governments in many low-income

00:09:13.222 --> 00:09:15.322
countries either don’t have the

00:09:15.322 --> 00:09:17.762
funds or don’t prioritise water

00:09:17.762 --> 00:09:20.692
projects, especially in remote areas.

00:09:21.612 --> 00:09:25.482
And while international aid does help, it

00:09:25.482 --> 00:09:28.162
often comes with bureaucracy, short-term

00:09:28.162 --> 00:09:30.882
timelines, or political strings attached.

00:09:31.722 --> 00:09:34.512
So the result is this: water

00:09:34.522 --> 00:09:37.112
exists, but it remains trapped

00:09:37.332 --> 00:09:39.352
under ground, tantalisingly

00:09:39.352 --> 00:09:42.382
close, but utterly out of reach.

00:09:43.862 --> 00:09:45.262
The third bucket we

00:09:45.262 --> 00:09:46.902
can call mismanagement.

00:09:47.982 --> 00:09:50.462
Even in places where water is

00:09:50.502 --> 00:09:52.802
available, in the form of plentiful

00:09:52.802 --> 00:09:55.242
rivers or lakes, it often becomes

00:09:55.242 --> 00:09:58.332
polluted and therefore unsafe: the

00:09:58.332 --> 00:10:00.722
Ganges being a classic example.

00:10:01.662 --> 00:10:05.122
And if it isn’t polluted, it’s often used

00:10:05.395 --> 00:10:08.042
inefficiently, for things that simply

00:10:08.102 --> 00:10:10.402
aren’t a good use of limited water.

00:10:11.792 --> 00:10:14.462
Globally, around 70% of all

00:10:14.462 --> 00:10:17.122
freshwater is used for agriculture.

00:10:18.292 --> 00:10:20.902
Sure, agriculture is a perfectly good

00:10:20.902 --> 00:10:24.202
use of water in some cases, but in

00:10:24.202 --> 00:10:26.032
many countries with limited water

00:10:26.042 --> 00:10:29.282
resources, that water is diverted

00:10:29.582 --> 00:10:32.092
to grow cash crops like cotton,

00:10:32.482 --> 00:10:35.742
sugar, or avocados — crops that are

00:10:35.752 --> 00:10:39.222
water-intensive and destined for export.

00:10:40.252 --> 00:10:42.572
I told you we’d return to the other

00:10:42.572 --> 00:10:44.292
reason that there’s a water crisis

00:10:44.302 --> 00:10:46.592
in Yemen, and that’s because it is

00:10:46.592 --> 00:10:49.372
especially guilty of mismanaging

00:10:49.542 --> 00:10:51.962
its already limited groundwater.

00:10:52.642 --> 00:10:55.542
Around 40% of the country’s water

00:10:55.542 --> 00:10:58.552
supply goes to growing something called

00:10:58.712 --> 00:11:01.762
qat, which is a narcotic plant that

00:11:01.762 --> 00:11:04.142
gives you a buzz when you chew it.

00:11:04.812 --> 00:11:07.932
It has zero nutritional value, and

00:11:08.202 --> 00:11:10.522
if production were banned, or if

00:11:10.522 --> 00:11:13.222
someone waved a magic wand and all

00:11:13.282 --> 00:11:15.892
qat production stopped, Yemen’s water

00:11:15.892 --> 00:11:18.692
crisis might not quite disappear, but

00:11:18.992 --> 00:11:21.472
some serious pressure would be relieved.

00:11:22.652 --> 00:11:26.632
Now, this is an extreme example of a very

00:11:26.652 --> 00:11:28.672
poor country that has been in a state

00:11:28.682 --> 00:11:31.202
of violent civil war for over 10 years,

00:11:31.582 --> 00:11:34.252
so it would be completely unreasonable

00:11:34.332 --> 00:11:36.762
to imagine a Yemeni qat farmer should

00:11:36.762 --> 00:11:38.902
spend any time thinking about the impact

00:11:38.902 --> 00:11:41.512
his crop has on the water level, when

00:11:41.802 --> 00:11:43.942
all he is trying to do is survive.

00:11:44.552 --> 00:11:47.312
But still, qat is a major contributor

00:11:47.312 --> 00:11:49.982
to Yemen’s water supply issues.

00:11:50.752 --> 00:11:52.472
And there are plenty of other

00:11:52.472 --> 00:11:54.842
examples of countries where water is

00:11:54.872 --> 00:11:58.072
diverted towards cash crops for export

00:11:58.382 --> 00:12:00.742
rather than domestic consumption.

00:12:01.982 --> 00:12:04.822
The central Asian nation of Uzbekistan

00:12:05.122 --> 00:12:07.942
is landlocked and has limited water

00:12:07.952 --> 00:12:10.952
resources, yet it is one of the world’s

00:12:10.952 --> 00:12:14.062
largest producers of cotton, which is

00:12:14.062 --> 00:12:16.412
a particularly water-intensive crop.

00:12:17.902 --> 00:12:19.722
If you are a long time listener to this

00:12:19.722 --> 00:12:22.022
show, you might remember the role of

00:12:22.072 --> 00:12:24.412
cotton farming in the disappearance of

00:12:24.412 --> 00:12:27.345
the Aral Sea, from episode number 12.

00:12:28.135 --> 00:12:30.922
Uzbekistan diverted so much water

00:12:31.262 --> 00:12:33.632
to this thirsty crop that a large

00:12:33.652 --> 00:12:36.752
sea simply dried up and disappeared.

00:12:37.772 --> 00:12:39.902
So that’s mismanagement.

00:12:40.832 --> 00:12:43.542
The fourth and final bucket is perhaps

00:12:43.552 --> 00:12:46.232
the most frustrating of all: neglect.

00:12:47.092 --> 00:12:49.072
Because sometimes the problem

00:12:49.152 --> 00:12:51.172
isn’t a lack of water, or a lack of

00:12:51.172 --> 00:12:54.002
funds, or even active mismanagement.

00:12:54.642 --> 00:12:57.472
It’s just that nobody bothers to fix it.

00:12:58.532 --> 00:13:00.832
Water doesn’t win elections.

00:13:00.962 --> 00:13:02.412
It doesn’t attract headlines.

00:13:02.712 --> 00:13:05.622
And unlike a new road, a shiny

00:13:05.622 --> 00:13:07.732
stadium, or a government building with

00:13:07.732 --> 00:13:09.842
someone’s name on the side, it doesn’t

00:13:09.842 --> 00:13:12.252
make for good photo opportunities.

00:13:12.872 --> 00:13:15.472
So politicians and planners

00:13:15.872 --> 00:13:17.982
focus their attention elsewhere.

00:13:18.992 --> 00:13:20.982
There are also cases where water

00:13:21.082 --> 00:13:23.902
infrastructure was built — perhaps by a

00:13:23.902 --> 00:13:27.242
foreign NGO or as part of an aid project

00:13:27.562 --> 00:13:30.922
— but was then left to fall into disrepair.

00:13:32.002 --> 00:13:33.012
Pumps break.

00:13:33.342 --> 00:13:34.362
Filters clog.

00:13:34.792 --> 00:13:35.922
Pipes corrode.

00:13:36.972 --> 00:13:39.532
And because there’s no system in place

00:13:39.532 --> 00:13:42.902
to maintain them, no local expertise or

00:13:43.142 --> 00:13:45.332
cost-efficient way of replacing broken

00:13:45.332 --> 00:13:48.462
parts, the community is left with nothing.

00:13:49.872 --> 00:13:53.369
According to some estimates, between 25

00:13:53.679 --> 00:13:56.872
and 40% of water points in sub-Saharan

00:13:56.872 --> 00:14:00.332
Africa are no longer functioning, often

00:14:00.692 --> 00:14:03.182
just a few years after installation.

00:14:04.712 --> 00:14:07.962
This is the quiet tragedy of the water

00:14:07.962 --> 00:14:10.572
crisis: it’s not always about what’s

00:14:10.622 --> 00:14:13.282
missing, it’s about what’s been forgotten.

00:14:14.122 --> 00:14:16.412
So, to recap, we have:

00:14:16.442 --> 00:14:18.102
Water that exists, but

00:14:18.422 --> 00:14:19.542
is in the wrong place.

00:14:19.922 --> 00:14:21.682
Communities that need it, but

00:14:21.692 --> 00:14:23.152
can’t afford to access it.

00:14:23.672 --> 00:14:25.902
Governments that are unable — or

00:14:26.132 --> 00:14:27.752
unwilling — to prioritise it.

00:14:28.322 --> 00:14:30.362
And domestic and international

00:14:30.362 --> 00:14:33.282
systems that are, at best, patchy

00:14:33.572 --> 00:14:35.632
and short-term in their efforts.

00:14:37.132 --> 00:14:40.822
Into this mix steps a man with a camera,

00:14:41.162 --> 00:14:43.682
a team of editors, and a couple of

00:14:43.682 --> 00:14:45.812
hundred million YouTube subscribers.

00:14:46.352 --> 00:14:49.272
He builds 100 wells, attracts heaps of

00:14:49.272 --> 00:14:52.382
praise and goodwill, and no doubt adds a

00:14:52.382 --> 00:14:54.532
few million people to his YouTube channel.

00:14:55.442 --> 00:14:57.652
Not so bad for a day’s work.

00:14:58.442 --> 00:15:01.212
Now, while the video received hundreds

00:15:01.212 --> 00:15:03.192
of thousands of positive comments,

00:15:03.402 --> 00:15:06.642
and millions more likes and shares, it

00:15:06.642 --> 00:15:08.712
also attracted a bunch of criticism.

00:15:09.842 --> 00:15:13.342
Some of it was predictable internet

00:15:13.342 --> 00:15:15.152
noise: he’s only doing it for the

00:15:15.152 --> 00:15:17.699
views, or why did he build 100

00:15:18.001 --> 00:15:19.892
and not 1,000, or he should have

00:15:19.892 --> 00:15:22.302
built hospitals rather than wells.

00:15:23.132 --> 00:15:25.812
But some raised important

00:15:26.122 --> 00:15:27.132
ethical questions.

00:15:28.406 --> 00:15:30.776
The first line of criticism was

00:15:30.776 --> 00:15:32.906
about performative charity, the

00:15:32.906 --> 00:15:35.336
idea that MrBeast was only helping

00:15:35.336 --> 00:15:37.756
these communities on camera, for

00:15:37.816 --> 00:15:40.886
content, and ultimately for profit.

00:15:42.006 --> 00:15:45.016
After all, his YouTube videos make money.

00:15:45.466 --> 00:15:48.896
A lot of money, and even if he specified

00:15:49.196 --> 00:15:51.576
that he was giving all of the advertising

00:15:51.576 --> 00:15:54.556
revenue away to the project, and he was

00:15:54.556 --> 00:15:57.076
raising money for his water-based charity,

00:15:57.316 --> 00:15:59.856
he would still benefit indirectly from it.

00:16:00.666 --> 00:16:03.406
So, the question becomes: is

00:16:03.406 --> 00:16:06.046
this charity, or is it a business

00:16:06.046 --> 00:16:08.276
model disguised as generosity?

00:16:08.686 --> 00:16:11.236
Would these wells have been built if

00:16:11.236 --> 00:16:13.566
there were no cameras, no thumbnails,

00:16:13.716 --> 00:16:16.396
no ad revenue, no brand sponsors?

00:16:17.246 --> 00:16:18.886
A second criticism was

00:16:18.896 --> 00:16:21.166
about power and agency.

00:16:22.106 --> 00:16:24.276
Why is it that the world’s richest

00:16:24.296 --> 00:16:26.396
countries, multinational development

00:16:26.396 --> 00:16:29.516
agencies, and national governments failed

00:16:29.576 --> 00:16:33.476
to act, and a private individual, with no

00:16:33.496 --> 00:16:36.646
public accountability, stepped in instead?

00:16:37.516 --> 00:16:39.736
Is this a celebration of generosity?

00:16:40.286 --> 00:16:42.726
Or a symptom of a system that

00:16:42.756 --> 00:16:44.806
has outsourced basic public

00:16:44.806 --> 00:16:46.746
services to influencers?

00:16:48.307 --> 00:16:50.577
And there was another layer of

00:16:50.577 --> 00:16:52.787
discomfort — one that’s harder

00:16:52.787 --> 00:16:55.137
to pin down, but no less real.

00:16:56.337 --> 00:16:58.217
Some commentators felt that the

00:16:58.217 --> 00:17:00.687
video, while well-intentioned,

00:17:01.057 --> 00:17:02.977
fell into a familiar pattern:

00:17:03.747 --> 00:17:05.917
The white saviour narrative.

00:17:06.747 --> 00:17:08.847
A wealthy American flies into

00:17:08.847 --> 00:17:11.027
African villages and solves their

00:17:11.047 --> 00:17:13.637
problem with the wave of a wand, or

00:17:13.847 --> 00:17:16.137
in this case, the twist of a valve.

00:17:17.507 --> 00:17:19.297
Of course, MrBeast didn’t

00:17:19.457 --> 00:17:20.807
invent that narrative.

00:17:21.207 --> 00:17:23.667
And much to his credit, he didn’t

00:17:23.677 --> 00:17:26.097
centre himself in the video as much

00:17:26.097 --> 00:17:27.607
as someone else might have done.

00:17:28.547 --> 00:17:31.877
But for many, the format still felt

00:17:32.007 --> 00:17:35.407
uncomfortably close to a feel-good Western

00:17:35.417 --> 00:17:38.037
intervention story, where local people

00:17:38.057 --> 00:17:40.697
are recipients of generosity rather

00:17:40.697 --> 00:17:42.857
than participants in the solutions.

00:17:44.027 --> 00:17:47.307
Another common criticism, one often

00:17:47.307 --> 00:17:49.327
heard in discussions about international

00:17:49.347 --> 00:17:52.057
aid more broadly, is that giving

00:17:52.147 --> 00:17:55.487
handouts discourages self-sufficiency.

00:17:56.037 --> 00:17:58.887
That it risks creating dependency.

00:17:59.517 --> 00:18:02.367
That if people grow used to others

00:18:02.407 --> 00:18:04.457
arriving and “solving problems”

00:18:04.457 --> 00:18:06.207
for them, they may lose the

00:18:06.207 --> 00:18:08.907
incentive — or the confidence — to

00:18:08.907 --> 00:18:10.937
build these solutions themselves.

00:18:12.387 --> 00:18:14.717
How could a local well-installation

00:18:14.717 --> 00:18:17.707
company ever compete on price with “free”?

00:18:18.367 --> 00:18:21.017
And what incentive is there to solve

00:18:21.027 --> 00:18:22.937
these problems if you know that there

00:18:22.937 --> 00:18:25.687
will be handouts at some stage, even if

00:18:25.687 --> 00:18:27.367
you might need to wait a while for them.

00:18:28.097 --> 00:18:30.267
This argument is especially common

00:18:30.497 --> 00:18:33.177
among critics of foreign aid: the idea

00:18:33.177 --> 00:18:36.317
that decades of charity have created

00:18:36.317 --> 00:18:39.127
a kind of learned helplessness, where

00:18:39.337 --> 00:18:41.237
African governments and communities

00:18:41.677 --> 00:18:44.287
wait for help rather than take action.

00:18:45.227 --> 00:18:46.977
Now, although there might be

00:18:46.987 --> 00:18:48.847
some truth here, there is also

00:18:48.847 --> 00:18:51.082
a danger of oversimplification.

00:18:52.097 --> 00:18:53.717
Building infrastructure like wells

00:18:54.087 --> 00:18:56.207
does require local expertise,

00:18:56.387 --> 00:18:58.377
materials, and maintenance.

00:18:58.827 --> 00:19:01.407
And many communities do already

00:19:01.787 --> 00:19:03.947
try to build and repair water

00:19:03.947 --> 00:19:06.187
systems, with or without help.

00:19:06.917 --> 00:19:09.440
Often, they’re just missing the capital

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:12.237
or political support to do so effectively.

00:19:13.327 --> 00:19:15.997
In MrBeast’s case, it’s worth noting

00:19:15.997 --> 00:19:18.187
that the wells were reportedly built

00:19:18.237 --> 00:19:20.577
in partnership with local contractors

00:19:20.577 --> 00:19:23.477
and NGOs, not just dropped in from

00:19:23.477 --> 00:19:26.317
above, and the ongoing maintenance

00:19:26.357 --> 00:19:28.507
and repair work of the wells will

00:19:28.517 --> 00:19:30.617
require local expertise and labour.

00:19:31.637 --> 00:19:34.197
Of course, the video doesn’t dwell on

00:19:34.197 --> 00:19:36.677
that side of things; it’s a 10-minute

00:19:36.677 --> 00:19:39.717
video intended to entertain and make

00:19:39.717 --> 00:19:41.417
you feel good, it was never going to

00:19:41.417 --> 00:19:43.927
go into the specifics of how everything

00:19:43.927 --> 00:19:45.967
was delivered and will be maintained.

00:19:47.297 --> 00:19:50.307
But this hasn’t stopped MrBeast’s critics

00:19:50.607 --> 00:19:53.487
from arguing that this video, and the

00:19:53.487 --> 00:19:56.697
entire project, creates an unbalanced

00:19:56.697 --> 00:19:59.817
picture: one where progress comes from

00:19:59.857 --> 00:20:02.877
outside, and where local people are

00:20:02.937 --> 00:20:06.007
passive recipients of foreign generosity.

00:20:06.987 --> 00:20:09.327
Now, to wrap things up, this is

00:20:09.327 --> 00:20:12.667
just one video, and these 100 wells

00:20:12.897 --> 00:20:15.357
are just a tiny step forward on the

00:20:15.367 --> 00:20:17.697
journey of securing clean, drinkable

00:20:17.697 --> 00:20:19.547
water for everyone who needs it.

00:20:20.567 --> 00:20:22.917
It did do a lot to raise awareness

00:20:22.947 --> 00:20:25.377
and money for global water projects,

00:20:25.527 --> 00:20:27.727
and showed people that getting

00:20:27.727 --> 00:20:30.237
clean water isn’t as complicated or

00:20:30.237 --> 00:20:32.180
expensive as they might have thought.

00:20:33.489 --> 00:20:36.367
According to one recent study, securing

00:20:36.447 --> 00:20:39.427
clean water for every person on the planet

00:20:39.877 --> 00:20:44.687
by 2030 could cost just 1% of global

00:20:44.717 --> 00:20:49.327
GDP - about 29 cents per person per day.

00:20:50.767 --> 00:20:53.387
It seems like a small price to pay,

00:20:53.867 --> 00:20:56.187
especially because the benefits

00:20:56.427 --> 00:20:58.737
greatly outweigh the cost, with this

00:20:58.737 --> 00:21:01.077
study suggesting that every dollar

00:21:01.087 --> 00:21:03.457
invested in water access and sanitation

00:21:03.947 --> 00:21:07.907
brings an average of $6.80 in return.

00:21:09.097 --> 00:21:11.347
If you ask me, it’s a good thing

00:21:11.477 --> 00:21:13.677
that someone with MrBeast’s reach

00:21:13.917 --> 00:21:15.707
is highlighting the problem of water

00:21:15.707 --> 00:21:18.097
access, but it certainly shouldn’t

00:21:18.107 --> 00:21:20.287
be theirs to fix, nor should they be

00:21:20.327 --> 00:21:22.557
criticised for “not doing enough”.

00:21:23.317 --> 00:21:26.517
Clearly, no single actor can solve

00:21:26.517 --> 00:21:28.227
the global water crisis alone.

00:21:28.927 --> 00:21:30.777
Governments carry the ultimate

00:21:30.777 --> 00:21:33.367
responsibility to provide safe water.

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:37.197
NGOs and international organisations

00:21:37.527 --> 00:21:40.267
can supply resources and expertise.

00:21:40.567 --> 00:21:42.737
Local communities bring the knowledge

00:21:42.997 --> 00:21:45.327
and capacity to keep systems running.

00:21:46.207 --> 00:21:48.737
And yes, sometimes even YouTubers

00:21:48.737 --> 00:21:51.717
with vast audiences can play a part by

00:21:51.737 --> 00:21:54.257
raising awareness and mobilising funds.

00:21:55.167 --> 00:21:58.307
Charity is never a substitute for strong

00:21:58.317 --> 00:22:00.957
institutions, but when it works alongside

00:22:01.007 --> 00:22:03.837
them, it can accelerate progress.

00:22:04.406 --> 00:22:07.101
And at the end of the day, the real

00:22:07.101 --> 00:22:09.961
test isn’t whether 100 wells can

00:22:09.961 --> 00:22:12.131
be built for a YouTube video, it’s

00:22:12.141 --> 00:22:14.221
whether we can build a world where

00:22:14.221 --> 00:22:17.251
videos like this aren’t needed at all.

00:22:19.121 --> 00:22:21.741
OK, then, that is it for today's episode

00:22:21.761 --> 00:22:24.561
on MrBeast and the Global Water Crisis.

00:22:24.881 --> 00:22:26.841
If you’d like to watch the video of him

00:22:26.851 --> 00:22:28.901
digging the wells, just go to YouTube

00:22:28.901 --> 00:22:31.361
and search for “MrBeast wells” - he is

00:22:31.361 --> 00:22:33.351
the biggest YouTuber in the world and

00:22:33.351 --> 00:22:35.141
you will have no trouble finding it.

00:22:35.811 --> 00:22:37.341
As always, I would love to know

00:22:37.341 --> 00:22:38.801
what you thought of this episode.

00:22:39.171 --> 00:22:41.181
Did you know about MrBeast before?

00:22:41.581 --> 00:22:42.611
What do you think of these

00:22:42.641 --> 00:22:44.871
kinds of massive YouTubers doing

00:22:44.871 --> 00:22:46.971
philanthropic work in their videos?

00:22:47.363 --> 00:22:49.621
Praiseworthy and good, deceptive and

00:22:49.631 --> 00:22:51.831
dangerous, or somewhere in between?

00:22:52.411 --> 00:22:53.501
you can head right into our

00:22:53.501 --> 00:22:55.121
community forum, which is at
