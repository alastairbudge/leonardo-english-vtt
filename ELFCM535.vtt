Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.460
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories and learn weird and

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.640
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.570
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is part three of our three-part

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.540
mini-series on the theme of important scientific discovery.

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:36.779
As a reminder, in case you missed them, part one was on the science of leap years and how humans

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.860
found an elegant solution to the problem of the inexact orbit of the Earth around the sun.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:50.650
Part two was on the amazing story of the discovery of the structure of DNA, and how two men in

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:56.660
particular tend to get all the credit, but the story is a little more complicated than that.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:03.680
And in part three, today’s episode, we are going to talk about how mathematics changed the world.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:10.900
So much of the world around us, arguably almost everything, can be explained through some form of

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:17.019
mathematical discovery, and today we are going to talk about some of the most weird and wonderful.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.220
From Italian Renaissance forts to why the number zero was so

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.799
revolutionary, we have a lot to get through, so let’s get right into it.

00:01:28.559 --> 00:01:32.639
The Greek mathematician Archimedes is once reported to have

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:37.960
said, “Give me a place to stand on, and I will move the Earth”.

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.039
It wasn’t a boast about his physical strength—there is no evidence to

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:48.589
suggest he was any stronger or weaker than any other man of his time.

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:57.210
Instead, it was a statement about a profound principle he had mathematically proven: leverage.

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:06.339
Leverage is the idea that, by using a long enough lever and the right fulcrum [the point

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:14.000
where the lever pivots], you can exert a small amount of force to move a much heavier object.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:21.210
Archimedes wasn’t the first person to “discover” this; anyone with a long piece

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.949
of wood could see that they could put it under something heavy, and if they

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.300
pressed down on the other end of it, the longer the distance between them and the

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.020
thing they were trying to lift, the less force they needed to lift the object.

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:43.850
Anyone could see that this was true, but Archimedes explained why it was true.

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:50.130
He was able to prove how this works using the principles of geometry

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.480
and balance, showing that the mechanics of levers were not just an

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:02.320
observation but a predictable, universal truth governed by mathematics.

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:08.269
Once he understood how it worked, there were practical implications.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:16.869
For example, he designed systems that allowed sailors to use ropes and pulley systems to lift

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:24.160
up heavy objects more easily, thereby decreasing the time required to load and unload ships.

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:31.280
It is just one example, but shows us the various steps that typically take place when

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:38.330
mathematics interacts with the real world, or as a father and son pair of professors from the

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.529
University of Stockholm and the University of Minnesota put it, “the calculating paradigm”.

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.810
To start, there is a real-world problem to be analysed.

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:56.570
In the case of the lever, anyone can observe the natural phenomenon; the longer the distance between

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:02.750
the thing you are trying to lift and the force you are exerting on it, the less force you need.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.590
The first step is to measure this.

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.479
What is the impact of changing the length of the lever, or adjusting

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.549
the position of the fulcrum, the point on which the lever is balanced?

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.500
When you change things, what happens?

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:26.260
The second step is what these professors, the Malmbergs, called “manipulation”.

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:32.839
In other words, you figure out the mathematical reason for what you observe.

00:04:34.119 --> 00:04:39.080
In the case of Archimedes and the lever, he observed that the relationship

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:45.140
between the lengths of the lever arms and the force required was proportional.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.580
The longer the arm where force was applied compared to the shorter

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.599
arm lifting the weight, the greater the mechanical advantage.

00:04:54.699 --> 00:05:00.130
This wasn’t just a rough guess—it was a precise mathematical

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.490
relationship that could be calculated and predicted.

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.610
This was what led Archimedes to famously quote that,

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:11.360
with a lever long enough, he could move the Earth.

00:05:12.206 --> 00:05:17.311
It’s true, mathematically, at least, it is possible; he had proven it.

00:05:18.521 --> 00:05:25.966
And now the final step of this “calculating paradigm” is what the Malmbergs called “application”.

00:05:27.106 --> 00:05:33.226
In other words, how can this mathematical understanding be applied to the real world?

00:05:34.316 --> 00:05:40.126
In the case of Archimedes, it was by designing things like pulley systems, which worked on

00:05:40.126 --> 00:05:46.366
the principle of levers and allowed sailors to lift much heavier objects than they would have

00:05:46.366 --> 00:05:51.286
been able to had they just been trying to pull them up with ropes, without pulley systems.

00:05:52.166 --> 00:05:58.006
This is, of course, just one theoretical model to look at mathematical developments,

00:05:58.356 --> 00:06:04.136
but it is a useful one when it comes to thinking about the real-world application of

00:06:04.136 --> 00:06:10.836
mathematics, how this comes from real-world observations, and how mathematics is the

00:06:10.846 --> 00:06:17.676
science of transforming and explaining what we see so that we improve the world around us.

00:06:18.636 --> 00:06:25.276
So, with that in mind, let’s talk about some other ways in which mathematics changed the world.

00:06:26.106 --> 00:06:28.956
The first is a seemingly simple one.

00:06:29.276 --> 00:06:30.706
The invention of zero.

00:06:31.406 --> 00:06:35.296
Now, if you didn’t know about this before, you could be forgiven

00:06:35.516 --> 00:06:38.976
for thinking that it is a strange addition to this episode.

00:06:39.596 --> 00:06:45.276
Zero means nothing, any child can observe that you can have one apple,

00:06:45.576 --> 00:06:50.136
you can have two apples, you can have no apples, or “zero” apples.

00:06:50.946 --> 00:06:56.136
But while the concept of having “nothing” may seem obvious, the

00:06:56.136 --> 00:07:00.296
mathematical representation of nothing wasn’t always so clear.

00:07:01.316 --> 00:07:05.126
In fact, the invention of zero as a number was one of

00:07:05.126 --> 00:07:08.226
the most revolutionary moments in mathematical history.

00:07:09.516 --> 00:07:14.376
For much of human history, you see, people counted without zero.

00:07:15.106 --> 00:07:21.976
In ancient times, the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans all managed without a proper zero.

00:07:22.836 --> 00:07:28.156
They sometimes left blank spaces or used placeholder symbols to mark

00:07:28.166 --> 00:07:33.336
gaps in their number systems, but this left plenty of room for confusion.

00:07:34.286 --> 00:07:38.746
Other civilisations, such as the Babylonians, used placeholders

00:07:38.746 --> 00:07:43.386
more systematically, and the Maya independently came up with zero.

00:07:44.046 --> 00:07:48.456
Still, the real breakthrough—treating zero not merely as a

00:07:48.566 --> 00:07:53.556
placeholder but as a fully-fledged number—happened in India.

00:07:54.606 --> 00:08:01.156
By the 7th century CE, the Indian mathematician Brahmagupta had formally defined zero,

00:08:01.436 --> 00:08:07.586
describing how it worked with addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

00:08:08.366 --> 00:08:10.236
This was revolutionary.

00:08:10.946 --> 00:08:17.966
Once you accept that zero is a number, you can write much bigger numbers more easily, and you can

00:08:18.006 --> 00:08:24.536
carry out more complex calculations—which was a key step toward developing advanced mathematics.

00:08:25.636 --> 00:08:31.573
To explain why this is so important, let’s take the example of the number 10.

00:08:32.876 --> 00:08:39.236
In the Roman numeral system, this was denominated by the letter X, whereas in the

00:08:39.236 --> 00:08:47.166
Hindu–Arabic numeral system, the number 10 is represented by two numbers: 1 and 0.

00:08:47.586 --> 00:08:53.146
The 1 represents one ten, and the 0 represents zero units.

00:08:53.876 --> 00:08:58.296
In the case of a small number like 10, it isn’t such a massive issue.

00:08:58.706 --> 00:09:00.856
But take a larger number.

00:09:01.409 --> 00:09:04.226
1,906, for example.

00:09:05.006 --> 00:09:08.436
Writing that in Roman numerals is a real pain.

00:09:08.946 --> 00:09:18.386
It is MCMVI, M represents 1,000, C represents 100, M represents 1,000 again,

00:09:18.606 --> 00:09:22.986
and because it has a C in front of it, you take 100 away from 1,000 to give

00:09:22.986 --> 00:09:30.846
900, then the V represents five, and the I represents 1, which gives you 1,906.

00:09:31.696 --> 00:09:35.566
Then, contrast this with writing it in decimals.

00:09:35.849 --> 00:09:37.586
1906.

00:09:38.336 --> 00:09:43.616
No doubt, even a Roman would admit that the decimal system is significantly superior.

00:09:44.256 --> 00:09:47.326
And this is thanks to the invention of zero.

00:09:48.016 --> 00:09:51.526
But zero didn’t just help us to write numbers.

00:09:52.266 --> 00:09:56.886
It allowed much more efficient calculations, including algebra

00:09:56.886 --> 00:10:01.586
and calculus, and the ability to work with much larger numbers.

00:10:02.566 --> 00:10:08.956
And the binary system, the system of 1s and 0s used by almost all computers

00:10:08.986 --> 00:10:13.646
and electronic devices, well this would be impossible without zero.

00:10:14.576 --> 00:10:21.916
So, while zero might seem like nothing, nothing important at least, the reality is anything but.

00:10:23.246 --> 00:10:30.866
Now, moving on to our next mathematical development, let’s talk about angles and perspective.

00:10:32.216 --> 00:10:37.036
As anyone can observe, if you look at a road disappearing into the

00:10:37.036 --> 00:10:42.406
horizon, it seems to narrow and get smaller the farther it goes.

00:10:43.216 --> 00:10:50.076
Or, when you see a row of trees in a field, the ones in the distance appear much

00:10:50.076 --> 00:10:55.917
smaller than the ones closer to you, even though, in reality, they’re all the same size.

00:10:57.217 --> 00:11:04.487
These are things that we all observe with our eyes, we know they are true, but for centuries,

00:11:04.757 --> 00:11:11.967
there was no mathematical framework to explain why this happens or how to represent it accurately.

00:11:13.137 --> 00:11:16.377
This changed during the Italian Renaissance.

00:11:17.227 --> 00:11:23.897
Wealthy city-states like Florence, Venice, and Milan were flourishing, and their patronage

00:11:23.897 --> 00:11:30.497
of artists, architects, and scientists encouraged innovation and exploration of new ideas.

00:11:31.757 --> 00:11:36.317
At the same time, Italian merchants were heavily involved in trade

00:11:36.477 --> 00:11:41.037
with the Islamic world, where advanced mathematical concepts had been

00:11:41.037 --> 00:11:45.777
preserved and expanded upon after originating in ancient Greece and India.

00:11:46.787 --> 00:11:54.107
One key area of focus was geometry, the mathematical study of shapes and space.

00:11:55.557 --> 00:11:59.817
Renaissance thinkers built on the work of ancient Greek mathematicians

00:11:59.827 --> 00:12:04.547
like Euclid, whose Elements laid out the foundations of geometry.

00:12:05.297 --> 00:12:11.827
But instead of simply studying these concepts in the abstract, they sought

00:12:11.887 --> 00:12:17.357
to apply them to real-world problems, including art and architecture.

00:12:18.637 --> 00:12:24.477
It was the architect and engineer Filippo Brunelleschi who first formalised the rules of

00:12:24.547 --> 00:12:32.497
linear perspective, a mathematical method for creating the illusion of depth on a flat surface.

00:12:33.237 --> 00:12:40.407
Using geometry, Brunelleschi demonstrated that parallel lines appear to converge as

00:12:40.407 --> 00:12:45.577
they recede into the distance, meeting at a single vanishing point on the horizon.

00:12:46.787 --> 00:12:53.537
This principle explained why objects appear smaller the farther away they are, and for the first

00:12:53.547 --> 00:13:01.407
time, it allowed artists to depict realistic three-dimensional scenes on two-dimensional canvases.

00:13:02.617 --> 00:13:07.157
That’s why, sometime in the early 15th century, you start to

00:13:07.157 --> 00:13:12.547
see frescoes–wall paintings–that accurately depict perspective.

00:13:13.537 --> 00:13:19.477
Of course, artists had tried to do this before, they had tried to accurately represent

00:13:19.607 --> 00:13:24.977
what they could clearly see in front of them, but it wasn’t until Brunelleschi and

00:13:25.127 --> 00:13:31.147
his mathematical rules of perspective that artists had a guidebook for how to do it.

00:13:32.287 --> 00:13:36.117
But the importance of perspective went beyond art.

00:13:36.847 --> 00:13:41.007
It influenced architecture, urban planning, and even

00:13:41.007 --> 00:13:44.167
the way we think about space and representation.

00:13:45.087 --> 00:13:51.222
By combining observation with mathematical precision, linear perspective symbolised

00:13:51.222 --> 00:13:56.497
the Renaissance spirit of connecting science, art, and the human experience.

00:13:57.537 --> 00:14:03.007
Now, we will stick in Italy and stick to the theme of geometry for development

00:14:03.017 --> 00:14:09.777
number three, however, this development was not cultural or artistic but military.

00:14:11.627 --> 00:14:18.737
If I ask you to picture a castle, perhaps you might think about a large square building with high

00:14:18.737 --> 00:14:25.817
walls and a tower in the middle, often strategically built on top of a hill or on high ground.

00:14:26.887 --> 00:14:30.567
For a long time, this was a very effective design.

00:14:31.557 --> 00:14:36.397
Invading enemy forces had to approach the castle and either

00:14:36.437 --> 00:14:39.857
put ladders against the walls or smash down the door.

00:14:40.667 --> 00:14:46.827
The higher the castle walls, the greater the advantage the defenders would have; archers would

00:14:46.837 --> 00:14:52.957
be able to fire greater distances, you could pour all sorts of horrible stuff onto people trying

00:14:52.957 --> 00:14:59.301
to climb up, and climbing up a ladder and getting over the walls just took a lot longer to do.

00:15:00.301 --> 00:15:05.941
But gunpowder and the invention of cannons changed all of this.

00:15:06.741 --> 00:15:13.081
A big high wall was an easy target to hit, and if a castle wall got a

00:15:13.121 --> 00:15:17.781
direct hit from a cannonball, well, that wasn’t good news for your castle.

00:15:18.591 --> 00:15:22.611
So, how do mathematics and geometry come in?

00:15:23.351 --> 00:15:29.101
Well, mathematics and geometry completely redesigned how fortresses were built,

00:15:29.581 --> 00:15:34.951
transforming them into structures that could better withstand the power of cannons.

00:15:36.431 --> 00:15:42.061
This new design was called the Star fort, or the trace italienne,

00:15:42.531 --> 00:15:46.201
and it was a revolutionary approach to military defence.

00:15:47.351 --> 00:15:52.521
Instead of tall, vertical walls that were easy targets for cannon fire,

00:15:53.291 --> 00:15:58.711
star forts had lower, thicker walls that were much harder to damage.

00:15:59.621 --> 00:16:04.841
These walls were also angled in such a way that cannonballs would hit

00:16:04.841 --> 00:16:10.181
them at an angle, skimming the side and reducing the force of the impact.

00:16:11.431 --> 00:16:15.731
But the most striking feature was the star-like shape of the fortress.

00:16:16.641 --> 00:16:21.051
The star shape wasn’t just decorative—it was highly strategic.

00:16:21.951 --> 00:16:28.181
The walls of the fort stuck out in triangular points, creating what were called bastions.

00:16:29.001 --> 00:16:34.831
These bastions allowed defenders to fire at approaching enemies from multiple angles,

00:16:35.241 --> 00:16:39.971
covering areas that would have been blind spots in a traditional square castle.

00:16:41.361 --> 00:16:45.451
If an enemy tried to approach one part of the fort, they would be

00:16:45.451 --> 00:16:50.401
exposed to fire from two or three different directions at once.

00:16:51.321 --> 00:16:56.331
Surrounding the fort was often something called a glacis, a gently

00:16:56.331 --> 00:17:00.431
sloping hill that made it even harder for attackers to get close.

00:17:01.221 --> 00:17:07.341
This slope forced cannonballs to lose much of their energy before they even reached the walls.

00:17:08.391 --> 00:17:13.211
Between the glacis and the main walls were moats or open spaces,

00:17:13.521 --> 00:17:17.387
further slowing down attackers and making them easier to target.

00:17:18.561 --> 00:17:24.861
This new design meant that an attacking army couldn’t simply march up and bombard the

00:17:24.861 --> 00:17:30.641
walls—they had to deal with a network of defences that made their job far more complicated.

00:17:31.056 --> 00:17:37.581
Sieges became longer and much more difficult, which gave defenders more time to prepare and resist.

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:44.369
And, given their superiority over traditional castle design, the geometry of

00:17:44.369 --> 00:17:49.929
star forts spread across Europe, and influenced fortress design for centuries.

00:17:50.869 --> 00:17:56.809
Now, for our fourth mathematical development, let’s cast our gaze skywards.

00:17:57.699 --> 00:18:03.049
As long as humans have had functioning eyes, we’ve observed the sun, moon,

00:18:03.369 --> 00:18:08.869
stars, and wandering planets and asked ourselves why they move the way they do.

00:18:09.999 --> 00:18:15.575
To come back to our “calculating paradigm”, it begins with observation and measurement,

00:18:15.839 --> 00:18:21.179
then moves on to mathematical manipulation, and finally, real-world application.

00:18:22.079 --> 00:18:27.099
But the drive to understand the heavens wasn’t just about cosmic curiosity;

00:18:27.539 --> 00:18:33.129
it also had a vital practical purpose: figuring out where on Earth we are.

00:18:34.119 --> 00:18:37.539
And nowhere was this harder than at sea.

00:18:38.649 --> 00:18:45.559
Without land-based markers, sailors had to rely on celestial objects, and while

00:18:45.559 --> 00:18:51.809
the idea of latitude was understood, accurately calculating it proved difficult.

00:18:52.841 --> 00:18:58.659
Early mariners used primitive star charts and tools to measure angles between the stars

00:18:58.659 --> 00:19:05.049
and the horizon, but their calculations could be cumbersome and they were prone to error.

00:19:06.609 --> 00:19:12.776
In the late 17th and early 18th centuries, however, two breakthroughs changed everything.

00:19:14.046 --> 00:19:19.456
First, mathematicians refined trigonometry and spherical geometry,

00:19:19.816 --> 00:19:23.756
building on centuries of work from Islamic and European scholars.

00:19:24.936 --> 00:19:31.086
For the first time, navigators had detailed tables and a sound theoretical

00:19:31.096 --> 00:19:37.996
framework to convert an angle measured on a spherical Earth into a precise location.

00:19:39.439 --> 00:19:43.719
Second, better printing methods allowed the widespread distribution

00:19:43.899 --> 00:19:49.159
of astronomical almanacs—carefully compiled lists of the sun’s,

00:19:49.359 --> 00:19:52.809
moon’s, and key stars’ positions for every day of the year.

00:19:54.009 --> 00:19:59.059
With one of these almanacs, and a sextant, the instrument sailors use to measure

00:19:59.099 --> 00:20:05.649
angles, a sailor could measure the angle between, let's say, the midday sun and the

00:20:05.649 --> 00:20:11.963
horizon, then compare it with the expected angle for any given date and latitude.

00:20:13.199 --> 00:20:18.659
By applying trigonometric formulas, they solved the geometry of the triangle

00:20:18.839 --> 00:20:23.339
formed by the horizon, the celestial object, and the observer’s position.

00:20:24.619 --> 00:20:31.259
With these calculations, it finally became possible to determine latitude with remarkable

00:20:31.259 --> 00:20:37.525
precision, even in the middle of the open ocean, surrounded by nothing but open water.

00:20:38.505 --> 00:20:43.545
This marriage of precise measurement and advanced mathematics was the reason

00:20:43.605 --> 00:20:49.048
18th-century mariners gained far greater navigational confidence than their predecessors.

00:20:49.582 --> 00:20:53.588
Voyages became more predictable, trade routes multiplied,

00:20:53.898 --> 00:20:57.718
and the world became more interconnected than ever before.

00:20:58.968 --> 00:21:02.498
Of course, the separate and equally challenging problem of

00:21:02.498 --> 00:21:06.748
calculating longitude remained, but that’s a story for another day.

00:21:07.598 --> 00:21:12.848
Right then, mathematical development number five, the last one we will talk about today.

00:21:13.968 --> 00:21:20.418
It is something that probably sounds decidedly unsexy, but it was incredibly important.

00:21:21.148 --> 00:21:27.848
And that was the development of double-entry bookkeeping, which came about in the 15th century.

00:21:28.898 --> 00:21:34.938
The idea is simple, but it revolutionised how businesses kept track of money.

00:21:36.318 --> 00:21:37.368
It works like this.

00:21:37.968 --> 00:21:41.778
Every financial transaction is recorded in at least

00:21:41.888 --> 00:21:46.368
two accounts—once as a credit and once as a debit.

00:21:47.258 --> 00:21:51.848
For example, if a merchant sells goods, they record both

00:21:51.858 --> 00:21:55.998
the income from the sale and the reduction in inventory.

00:21:57.338 --> 00:22:01.318
This method provided businesses with a clear and reliable

00:22:01.318 --> 00:22:05.918
way to track profits, losses, and overall financial health.

00:22:06.648 --> 00:22:12.788
It's not known who exactly “invented it”, but it was formalised by an Italian

00:22:12.788 --> 00:22:17.818
monk named Luca Pacioli, who is often called the “father of accounting.”

00:22:18.568 --> 00:22:23.018
Again, unless you have a deep-seated passion for accounting, it might

00:22:23.018 --> 00:22:27.798
sound deadly boring, but it is hard to overstate its importance.

00:22:28.438 --> 00:22:32.998
It provided merchants with mathematical precision, giving them the tools

00:22:33.188 --> 00:22:38.248
to expand their operations, secure loans, and make long-term investments.

00:22:38.878 --> 00:22:46.288
This Italian monk arguably did more for capitalism and global economic growth than anyone has since.

00:22:47.698 --> 00:22:52.188
So, there we have it, levers, zeroes, linear perspective,

00:22:52.238 --> 00:22:55.318
star forts, and even double-entry bookkeeping.

00:22:55.788 --> 00:23:01.848
These are but a few of the many ways in which mathematics changed the world.

00:23:03.318 --> 00:23:08.518
OK then, that is it for today's episode on mathematics, and with that comes

00:23:08.518 --> 00:23:12.798
the end of this three-part mini-series on the theme of “scientific discovery”.

00:23:13.248 --> 00:23:16.658
In case you missed them, in part one, we had the science of

00:23:16.688 --> 00:23:21.278
leap years, and in part two, it was the discovery of DNA.

00:23:21.788 --> 00:23:26.977
And I should also say that this was a member request from a fascinating guy called

00:23:26.977 --> 00:23:31.708
Lorenzo, who asked if I would dedicate this episode to his brother, Francesco.

00:23:32.108 --> 00:23:37.438
So, Lorenzo, or indeed, Francesco, here you go, this one is for you.

00:23:38.108 --> 00:23:42.878
You've been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo English.

00:23:43.358 --> 00:23:48.748
I'm Alastair Budge, you stay safe, and I'll catch you in the next episode.
