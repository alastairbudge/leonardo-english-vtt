Hello, hello, hello, and welcome

00:00:07.535 --> 00:00:09.515
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.515 --> 00:00:12.285
Minds, by Leonardo English, the show

00:00:12.295 --> 00:00:14.055
where you can listen to fascinating

00:00:14.055 --> 00:00:16.495
stories and learn weird and wonderful

00:00:16.505 --> 00:00:18.525
things about the world at the same

00:00:18.525 --> 00:00:20.285
time as improving your English.

00:00:20.865 --> 00:00:23.245
I'm Alastair Budge, and today

00:00:23.365 --> 00:00:24.915
we are going to be talking

00:00:25.095 --> 00:00:27.245
about the Iran-Contra Affair.

00:00:27.845 --> 00:00:30.205
It’s the American scandal involving

00:00:30.205 --> 00:00:33.205
Ronald Reagan, missiles, revolutions,

00:00:33.245 --> 00:00:36.565
rebels, hostages, dodgy arms dealers,

00:00:36.815 --> 00:00:39.675
the US Constitution, covert operations,

00:00:39.745 --> 00:00:42.485
Swiss bank accounts, and the seemingly

00:00:42.745 --> 00:00:46.565
unrelated countries of Nicaragua and Iran.

00:00:47.205 --> 00:00:49.745
It’s a particularly long and complicated

00:00:49.745 --> 00:00:53.195
one, but it is fascinating, so let’s not

00:00:53.195 --> 00:00:56.175
waste a minute and get right into it.

00:00:57.775 --> 00:00:59.585
If you are the sort of person

00:00:59.595 --> 00:01:02.345
who yearns for power, you can’t

00:01:02.345 --> 00:01:04.395
do much better than becoming the

00:01:04.435 --> 00:01:06.455
president of the United States.

00:01:06.965 --> 00:01:09.285
You are essentially the chief

00:01:09.315 --> 00:01:11.955
executive of the world’s richest

00:01:12.145 --> 00:01:13.715
and most powerful country.

00:01:14.155 --> 00:01:15.625
You can do what you want.

00:01:16.675 --> 00:01:17.935
Of course, you can’t

00:01:17.935 --> 00:01:19.415
do everything you want.

00:01:20.075 --> 00:01:22.515
The US Constitution has a rigid

00:01:22.525 --> 00:01:25.385
set of checks and balances, in

00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:27.435
the form of the other branches of

00:01:27.435 --> 00:01:30.255
government: Congress and the Judiciary.

00:01:31.085 --> 00:01:33.565
Pretty much every president in American

00:01:33.565 --> 00:01:37.495
history has found themselves blocked in

00:01:37.565 --> 00:01:40.955
some way by the laws and wishes of these

00:01:41.045 --> 00:01:44.015
other branches, some more than others.

00:01:44.775 --> 00:01:47.375
Ronald Reagan was no exception.

00:01:48.452 --> 00:01:51.595
He had been elected in a landslide victory

00:01:51.825 --> 00:01:55.985
in 1980, partly due to the unpopularity

00:01:55.985 --> 00:01:58.495
of his opponent, the sitting President

00:01:58.575 --> 00:02:02.285
Jimmy Carter, and partly on a platform

00:02:02.415 --> 00:02:04.875
to bring back conservative values.

00:02:06.045 --> 00:02:08.955
And one of Reagan’s big personal

00:02:08.955 --> 00:02:11.715
beliefs was in the danger of

00:02:11.755 --> 00:02:14.345
communism, not just in the United

00:02:14.345 --> 00:02:16.595
States, but all over the world.

00:02:18.295 --> 00:02:20.745
A big part of this was the concept

00:02:20.905 --> 00:02:24.085
known as “domino theory”, the idea that

00:02:24.335 --> 00:02:27.245
if one country fell to communism, it

00:02:27.245 --> 00:02:29.635
would spread like a virus, infecting

00:02:29.725 --> 00:02:31.595
all the neighbouring countries

00:02:31.685 --> 00:02:33.935
before continuing all over the world.

00:02:35.315 --> 00:02:38.535
And Reagan, despite plenty of evidence

00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:41.505
to suggest that communism wasn’t as viral

00:02:41.785 --> 00:02:44.655
as its greatest critics suggested, well,

00:02:45.045 --> 00:02:47.895
he wasn’t prepared to take any chances.

00:02:49.445 --> 00:02:52.475
His staunch belief was that communism was

00:02:52.475 --> 00:02:55.225
one of the great dangers facing the world,

00:02:55.565 --> 00:02:58.685
and he was prepared to do whatever it

00:02:58.685 --> 00:03:02.095
took to stop it, especially if it showed

00:03:02.095 --> 00:03:04.575
signs of approaching the American border.

00:03:05.585 --> 00:03:08.275
And this was hardly a Reagan invention;

00:03:08.605 --> 00:03:11.885
the CIA had spent decades secretly

00:03:11.885 --> 00:03:13.955
financing groups opposed to communism,

00:03:14.325 --> 00:03:17.415
everywhere from Latin America to Africa.

00:03:18.705 --> 00:03:20.905
One of the groups the US had been

00:03:20.905 --> 00:03:23.225
financing was called the Contras.

00:03:23.715 --> 00:03:25.855
It was a right-wing guerrilla group

00:03:26.105 --> 00:03:27.925
fighting against the communists

00:03:28.185 --> 00:03:30.145
that had come to power in Nicaragua

00:03:30.455 --> 00:03:32.185
after the Sandinista Revolution.

00:03:33.235 --> 00:03:36.655
Now, Nicaragua isn’t particularly

00:03:36.655 --> 00:03:38.535
close to the United States; you have

00:03:38.725 --> 00:03:41.235
Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala,

00:03:41.455 --> 00:03:44.835
Belize and Mexico which act as a buffer.

00:03:45.395 --> 00:03:48.295
But it was still too close to home.

00:03:49.145 --> 00:03:52.585
So the CIA provided financial and

00:03:52.595 --> 00:03:54.455
military support to this group that

00:03:54.455 --> 00:03:56.695
would stir up trouble in Nicaragua,

00:03:56.995 --> 00:03:58.855
doing everything it could to

00:03:58.855 --> 00:04:01.465
disrupt the left-wing Sandinistas.

00:04:02.725 --> 00:04:05.675
Now, we’ll press pause on the Contras,

00:04:05.915 --> 00:04:09.235
as we now need to move right over to the

00:04:09.315 --> 00:04:11.715
other side of the geopolitical chessboard

00:04:12.045 --> 00:04:13.865
to a region in which the United States

00:04:14.105 --> 00:04:17.205
had other interests, interests that

00:04:17.205 --> 00:04:19.845
seemed to be completely unrelated to

00:04:19.845 --> 00:04:23.125
Nicaragua, but would turn out to be

00:04:23.125 --> 00:04:25.285
more related than initially thought.

00:04:26.505 --> 00:04:29.795
In 1979, the Iranian Revolution

00:04:30.105 --> 00:04:32.255
led to the overthrow of the Shah of

00:04:32.255 --> 00:04:35.805
Iran and the swift transition from a

00:04:35.805 --> 00:04:39.015
Western-leaning monarchy to an Islamic

00:04:39.015 --> 00:04:42.125
Republic hostile to Western influence.

00:04:42.885 --> 00:04:44.545
Later that year, a group of

00:04:44.545 --> 00:04:46.915
students stormed the US embassy

00:04:47.215 --> 00:04:49.845
and took 66 Americans hostage.

00:04:50.765 --> 00:04:53.765
This would come to be known as the Iran

00:04:53.975 --> 00:04:56.805
Hostage Crisis, and would last from

00:04:56.805 --> 00:05:01.625
November 1979 to January 1981, with the

00:05:01.635 --> 00:05:04.355
last hostages being released on the day of

00:05:04.355 --> 00:05:06.795
Ronald Reagan’s inauguration as president.

00:05:08.185 --> 00:05:11.585
As a result of the hostage crisis and

00:05:11.825 --> 00:05:14.405
of the Republic of Iran’s stated aim

00:05:14.415 --> 00:05:16.515
of spreading Islamic fundamentalism

00:05:16.755 --> 00:05:18.815
through the Middle East, the United

00:05:18.815 --> 00:05:20.905
States cut off all ties with the

00:05:20.905 --> 00:05:24.415
country, even going so far as to declare

00:05:24.415 --> 00:05:26.985
it a “state sponsor of terrorism”.

00:05:28.395 --> 00:05:30.495
This was a perfectly reasonable

00:05:30.505 --> 00:05:33.005
assessment; Iran was and still

00:05:33.005 --> 00:05:34.715
is the largest sponsor of

00:05:34.715 --> 00:05:36.045
terrorist groups in the region.

00:05:36.745 --> 00:05:39.275
But there were several problems

00:05:39.475 --> 00:05:40.935
with the United States breaking

00:05:40.935 --> 00:05:42.425
off all contact with the country,

00:05:42.695 --> 00:05:45.755
both for Iran and for the US.

00:05:46.975 --> 00:05:49.515
For Iran, it meant cutting off a

00:05:49.525 --> 00:05:52.165
vital source of military equipment.

00:05:53.195 --> 00:05:56.105
Under the Shah, Iran had been

00:05:56.105 --> 00:05:58.335
one of America’s best customers.

00:05:58.929 --> 00:06:00.795
Billions of dollars’ worth of

00:06:00.795 --> 00:06:03.415
U.S. jets, tanks, and missiles

00:06:03.645 --> 00:06:04.965
had been shipped to Iran.

00:06:06.035 --> 00:06:09.415
When relations broke, Iran was left with

00:06:09.415 --> 00:06:11.965
a shiny arsenal it couldn’t maintain.

00:06:12.955 --> 00:06:16.175
This was a problem, and an even greater

00:06:16.175 --> 00:06:19.175
one after September of 1980, when

00:06:19.315 --> 00:06:21.925
Saddam Hussein decided to invade Iran.

00:06:23.135 --> 00:06:25.225
For the United States, on the other

00:06:25.225 --> 00:06:27.845
hand, the loss of a former key

00:06:27.915 --> 00:06:30.415
ally could mean further instability

00:06:30.715 --> 00:06:32.785
in an already volatile region.

00:06:33.715 --> 00:06:35.815
And in fact, selling Iran the

00:06:35.815 --> 00:06:37.485
weapons it needed to fight off

00:06:37.485 --> 00:06:40.085
the Iraqi threat was no bad thing.

00:06:40.855 --> 00:06:43.555
A little war between Iran and

00:06:43.555 --> 00:06:45.875
Iraq actually served American

00:06:45.875 --> 00:06:47.415
interests quite nicely.

00:06:48.335 --> 00:06:51.215
The US didn’t want either side to

00:06:51.215 --> 00:06:54.225
emerge completely victorious, and the

00:06:54.235 --> 00:06:57.205
best possible scenario was a drawn-out

00:06:57.215 --> 00:07:00.045
conflict that left both parties weaker.

00:07:01.625 --> 00:07:03.185
And there was a third

00:07:03.205 --> 00:07:05.055
interested party: Israel.

00:07:06.055 --> 00:07:09.485
Israel had similar goals to the US when

00:07:09.485 --> 00:07:11.805
it came to supplying Iran with weapons:

00:07:12.265 --> 00:07:14.915
keep Iran and Iraq busy fighting amongst

00:07:14.915 --> 00:07:18.032
themselves, so that both emerge weaker.

00:07:18.975 --> 00:07:20.905
Now, I appreciate that things are

00:07:20.905 --> 00:07:23.315
getting complicated, but let me add

00:07:23.335 --> 00:07:26.225
one more country to the mix: Lebanon.

00:07:27.415 --> 00:07:29.685
Lebanon in the 1980s

00:07:29.685 --> 00:07:31.585
was in a state of chaos.

00:07:32.065 --> 00:07:34.895
The country had been torn apart by civil

00:07:34.895 --> 00:07:38.135
war, and in the middle of it, groups

00:07:38.265 --> 00:07:41.415
backed by Iran, including Hezbollah, had

00:07:41.415 --> 00:07:44.065
begun kidnapping Americans in Beirut.

00:07:44.565 --> 00:07:47.445
Journalists, teachers, and diplomats

00:07:47.485 --> 00:07:49.855
were taken and held for years.

00:07:50.475 --> 00:07:52.825
Even the CIA station chief,

00:07:53.155 --> 00:07:54.995
William Buckley, was taken.

00:07:56.245 --> 00:07:58.095
Their captors demanded the

00:07:58.095 --> 00:08:00.235
release of Hezbollah operatives

00:08:00.425 --> 00:08:02.355
being held in Israeli jails.

00:08:03.125 --> 00:08:05.925
This wasn’t going to happen; Ronald

00:08:05.925 --> 00:08:08.605
Reagan had built his reputation on

00:08:08.605 --> 00:08:11.095
never negotiating with terrorists, and

00:08:11.355 --> 00:08:14.065
it would be a huge public humiliation

00:08:14.245 --> 00:08:16.955
to go back on this, especially with

00:08:16.955 --> 00:08:19.555
the memory of the Iran Hostage Crisis

00:08:19.745 --> 00:08:21.825
still fresh in everyone’s minds.

00:08:22.555 --> 00:08:24.895
But, he did want the American

00:08:24.895 --> 00:08:27.665
hostages home safe, and it would

00:08:27.665 --> 00:08:30.415
certainly be convenient if there

00:08:30.415 --> 00:08:32.755
were some way of making this happen.

00:08:34.075 --> 00:08:37.192
And so, by the mid-1980s,

00:08:37.225 --> 00:08:38.825
the stage was set.

00:08:39.565 --> 00:08:40.395
On the one side,

00:08:40.955 --> 00:08:42.945
Nicaragua and the Contras.

00:08:43.395 --> 00:08:46.195
On the other, Iran, desperate for

00:08:46.195 --> 00:08:49.695
weapons, officially America’s sworn enemy,

00:08:50.075 --> 00:08:53.295
but also the only country with enough

00:08:53.355 --> 00:08:56.225
influence on Hezbollah to help secure the

00:08:56.225 --> 00:08:58.425
release of American hostages in Lebanon.

00:08:59.405 --> 00:09:01.645
And in the middle, Israel.

00:09:02.725 --> 00:09:05.865
Now, it’s important to stress that, even

00:09:05.865 --> 00:09:09.085
though we now talk of the “Iran-Contra

00:09:09.085 --> 00:09:11.795
Scandal”, the Iranians had nothing to

00:09:11.795 --> 00:09:14.205
do with the Contras, at least directly.

00:09:15.275 --> 00:09:16.665
And there wouldn’t have been

00:09:16.735 --> 00:09:19.265
any “scandal” were it not for

00:09:19.305 --> 00:09:20.755
Congress getting in the way.

00:09:21.545 --> 00:09:24.235
Bringing it back to the three branches of

00:09:24.235 --> 00:09:26.325
government we talked about at the start,

00:09:27.085 --> 00:09:31.565
starting in 1982, Congress passed a series

00:09:31.585 --> 00:09:34.155
of laws that would come to be known as

00:09:34.155 --> 00:09:37.085
the Boland Amendments, which prohibited

00:09:37.105 --> 00:09:39.075
United States intelligence agencies

00:09:39.365 --> 00:09:41.986
from providing funding for the Contras.

00:09:42.364 --> 00:09:44.824
Now, there was a series of amendments

00:09:44.864 --> 00:09:47.514
because each one went slightly further

00:09:47.714 --> 00:09:49.864
in terms of what was prohibited; we

00:09:49.864 --> 00:09:51.764
won’t go into the details of each

00:09:51.764 --> 00:09:54.484
one, but the important thing was

00:09:54.484 --> 00:09:57.674
that the clear intention was to stop

00:09:57.874 --> 00:10:00.414
U.S. involvement in Nicaragua’s war.

00:10:01.434 --> 00:10:02.854
There were several reasons for

00:10:02.854 --> 00:10:05.364
this, from the documented human

00:10:05.364 --> 00:10:07.034
rights abuses committed by the

00:10:07.034 --> 00:10:09.684
Contras through to a general public

00:10:09.724 --> 00:10:12.344
weariness of US involvement in the

00:10:12.354 --> 00:10:13.924
domestic affairs of other countries.

00:10:15.224 --> 00:10:18.069
And on paper, that was the end of it.

00:10:18.364 --> 00:10:20.544
The United States was now legally

00:10:20.554 --> 00:10:23.124
forbidden from funding the Contras.

00:10:23.994 --> 00:10:27.454
Now, to understand the next chapter

00:10:27.474 --> 00:10:29.834
of this story, we need to understand

00:10:30.104 --> 00:10:32.804
a bit more about the power dynamics

00:10:32.864 --> 00:10:34.574
within the Reagan administration.

00:10:35.394 --> 00:10:36.964
Ronald Reagan was very

00:10:36.964 --> 00:10:39.104
much a “big picture” man.

00:10:39.704 --> 00:10:42.134
He had strong convictions — fight

00:10:42.134 --> 00:10:44.364
communism, support freedom fighters,

00:10:44.774 --> 00:10:47.224
stand tall against America’s enemies

00:10:47.694 --> 00:10:50.604
— but he wasn’t a details person.

00:10:51.624 --> 00:10:54.074
He liked to set the general direction,

00:10:54.454 --> 00:10:56.554
then let his advisers work out the

00:10:56.554 --> 00:10:59.294
details of how to actually implement it.

00:10:59.934 --> 00:11:01.834
He would be brought memos to read

00:11:01.834 --> 00:11:04.184
or documents to sign off on, but

00:11:04.664 --> 00:11:05.824
he wouldn’t always read them,

00:11:06.294 --> 00:11:07.944
even before adding his signature.

00:11:09.644 --> 00:11:11.154
Remember this, as it’ll

00:11:11.164 --> 00:11:12.594
be important later on.

00:11:13.464 --> 00:11:15.364
What this meant was that his

00:11:15.384 --> 00:11:17.174
administration was filled with

00:11:17.174 --> 00:11:19.264
people who understood their role

00:11:19.424 --> 00:11:22.404
as interpreting what Reagan wanted

00:11:22.714 --> 00:11:25.064
and translating it into action.

00:11:25.914 --> 00:11:28.064
As long as they were executing

00:11:28.064 --> 00:11:30.604
his broad wishes, they had the

00:11:30.604 --> 00:11:32.414
green light to get creative.

00:11:33.964 --> 00:11:37.024
The first “creative” project was to do

00:11:37.034 --> 00:11:39.884
with getting the US hostages back, and

00:11:40.114 --> 00:11:43.384
this conveniently tied in with the problem

00:11:43.664 --> 00:11:46.064
of how to continue supplying the Iranians

00:11:46.204 --> 00:11:49.464
with weapons, despite Iran having become

00:11:49.474 --> 00:11:51.864
a sworn enemy of the United States.

00:11:52.984 --> 00:11:55.154
How it went was something like this.

00:11:56.094 --> 00:11:58.594
The Americans were approached by an

00:11:58.594 --> 00:12:02.237
Iranian named Manucher Ghorbanifar.

00:12:03.244 --> 00:12:06.774
He was a shady individual, a “devious

00:12:06.774 --> 00:12:09.284
character” according to Ronald Reagan and

00:12:09.594 --> 00:12:11.784
"one of the most despicable characters

00:12:11.784 --> 00:12:13.944
I have ever met", according to Robert

00:12:13.944 --> 00:12:16.674
MacFarlane, a National Security Advisor

00:12:16.934 --> 00:12:18.914
who we’ll meet again in a few minutes.

00:12:19.574 --> 00:12:23.404
He was a dodgy fellow, but he claimed to

00:12:23.404 --> 00:12:26.254
have influence within the Iranian regime.

00:12:27.674 --> 00:12:30.064
He told the Americans that if they

00:12:30.064 --> 00:12:33.494
supplied Iran with missiles, Iran

00:12:33.684 --> 00:12:36.294
would put pressure on Hezbollah to

00:12:36.294 --> 00:12:38.574
release the hostages held in Lebanon.

00:12:40.514 --> 00:12:42.674
Ghorbanifar wasn’t doing this out

00:12:42.674 --> 00:12:44.124
of the goodness of his own heart,

00:12:44.124 --> 00:12:46.604
of course; he stood to collect a

00:12:46.614 --> 00:12:48.724
healthy commission on the sale.

00:12:50.174 --> 00:12:52.584
The trade would all be facilitated

00:12:52.824 --> 00:12:55.984
through Israel, so the US would

00:12:55.994 --> 00:12:58.344
transfer the weapons to Israel, which

00:12:58.344 --> 00:13:00.564
would then secretly send them to Iran.

00:13:01.274 --> 00:13:03.994
In practice, Israel supplied some

00:13:04.004 --> 00:13:07.314
missiles from its own stocks, with

00:13:07.314 --> 00:13:09.344
U.S. approval, and would later be

00:13:09.344 --> 00:13:11.154
replenished by the United States.

00:13:11.794 --> 00:13:14.424
The Iranians would pay the agreed price,

00:13:14.844 --> 00:13:16.844
and the hostages would be released.

00:13:17.834 --> 00:13:20.374
It all went to plan, apart from

00:13:20.374 --> 00:13:22.424
the small detail that not all

00:13:22.424 --> 00:13:23.694
the hostages were released.

00:13:24.384 --> 00:13:26.014
In fact, what happened

00:13:26.024 --> 00:13:27.664
was almost the opposite.

00:13:28.194 --> 00:13:30.594
Yes, the Iranians got their missiles.

00:13:30.724 --> 00:13:33.334
Yes, Ghorbanifar pocketed his commission.

00:13:33.674 --> 00:13:36.694
But instead of releasing all the

00:13:36.694 --> 00:13:39.874
American hostages, Hezbollah freed one

00:13:40.094 --> 00:13:41.834
and then promptly kidnapped another.

00:13:42.574 --> 00:13:45.304
It became a grim game of hostage

00:13:45.474 --> 00:13:48.394
musical chairs: one out, one in.

00:13:49.444 --> 00:13:53.104
Now, this was all very much done behind

00:13:53.124 --> 00:13:55.724
closed doors; it wasn’t public knowledge.

00:13:56.284 --> 00:13:58.614
And there was debate within the

00:13:58.614 --> 00:14:00.774
White House about what to do next.

00:14:01.454 --> 00:14:04.294
Ghorbanifar said that the Iranians needed

00:14:04.294 --> 00:14:06.834
more missiles, and they would make sure

00:14:06.854 --> 00:14:08.624
the hostages were released if they were

00:14:08.624 --> 00:14:11.844
only sent a new batch, but this time

00:14:12.064 --> 00:14:15.114
of more sophisticated HAWK missiles.

00:14:16.224 --> 00:14:18.124
Despite the obvious reservations

00:14:18.424 --> 00:14:20.524
about Ghorbanifar’s trustworthiness,

00:14:20.724 --> 00:14:23.394
his clear financial incentive to

00:14:23.394 --> 00:14:25.094
broker as many deals as possible,

00:14:25.434 --> 00:14:27.494
and his claims to have influence,

00:14:27.544 --> 00:14:29.304
which may have been exaggerated,

00:14:29.694 --> 00:14:31.994
the Americans decided to go ahead.

00:14:33.384 --> 00:14:35.134
They had opened the door to Iran,

00:14:35.484 --> 00:14:37.514
and there were people inside the

00:14:37.514 --> 00:14:39.314
Reagan administration who thought

00:14:39.334 --> 00:14:41.914
that, despite the obvious risks,

00:14:42.194 --> 00:14:43.714
this was still worth pursuing.

00:14:44.834 --> 00:14:46.894
Robert McFarlane, the National

00:14:46.894 --> 00:14:49.444
Security Adviser, and his successor

00:14:49.774 --> 00:14:52.304
John Poindexter, they believed that

00:14:52.324 --> 00:14:54.914
engaging Iran could be part of a

00:14:54.944 --> 00:14:57.484
longer-term strategy, not just to

00:14:57.774 --> 00:15:00.804
free hostages, but to build bridges

00:15:00.864 --> 00:15:03.374
with so-called “moderates” inside

00:15:03.374 --> 00:15:05.317
the Iranian regime, moderates

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:07.994
that Ghorbanifar promised existed.

00:15:09.444 --> 00:15:12.164
But, again, the same thing happened.

00:15:12.694 --> 00:15:15.474
Iran got its weapons, Ghorbanifar

00:15:15.514 --> 00:15:17.264
got his fat commission for brokering

00:15:17.264 --> 00:15:20.214
the detail, and all but one of

00:15:20.214 --> 00:15:22.844
the hostages remained in Lebanon.

00:15:24.044 --> 00:15:25.964
In fact, there is another character

00:15:25.974 --> 00:15:27.774
in this story you might remember

00:15:27.774 --> 00:15:30.374
from another episode: the Saudi

00:15:30.404 --> 00:15:32.194
arms dealer, Adnan Khashoggi.

00:15:32.914 --> 00:15:34.854
He was a key associate of

00:15:34.884 --> 00:15:37.384
Ghorbanifar and provided connections

00:15:37.384 --> 00:15:38.904
and financing for the deals.

00:15:39.494 --> 00:15:41.104
If you’d like to hear more about

00:15:41.114 --> 00:15:44.164
his fascinating and very dodgy life,

00:15:44.504 --> 00:15:47.884
episode number 466 is the one for you.

00:15:48.934 --> 00:15:52.154
Now, the man on the American side

00:15:52.464 --> 00:15:54.874
tasked with running the day-to-day

00:15:55.094 --> 00:15:57.734
details of this operation was a Marine

00:15:57.784 --> 00:16:00.674
lieutenant colonel called Oliver North.

00:16:01.674 --> 00:16:04.474
North worked in the National Security

00:16:04.474 --> 00:16:08.294
Council staff, the NSC, and he

00:16:08.294 --> 00:16:10.534
was the sort of officer who prided

00:16:10.534 --> 00:16:12.844
himself on “getting things done.”

00:16:14.294 --> 00:16:16.914
One of the things he was tasked with was

00:16:16.914 --> 00:16:19.644
finding creative ways to get around the

00:16:19.644 --> 00:16:22.284
Boland Amendment, the legal amendment

00:16:22.434 --> 00:16:24.234
prohibiting the US from providing

00:16:24.234 --> 00:16:26.184
federal funding for the Contras.

00:16:27.754 --> 00:16:30.314
One thing he did was make it clear to

00:16:30.314 --> 00:16:34.004
American allies that if they provided

00:16:34.004 --> 00:16:36.574
funding for the Contras, this could get

00:16:36.604 --> 00:16:38.944
them favourable treatment from the US.

00:16:39.854 --> 00:16:42.334
And several countries were perfectly

00:16:42.334 --> 00:16:44.484
willing to donate, giving money

00:16:44.654 --> 00:16:46.674
to the Contras, essentially on

00:16:46.674 --> 00:16:48.154
behalf of the United States.

00:16:48.834 --> 00:16:52.254
There was $32 million from Saudi Arabia.

00:16:52.924 --> 00:16:54.904
The Sultan of Brunei, on the other

00:16:54.904 --> 00:16:57.924
hand, transferred $10 million to a

00:16:57.934 --> 00:17:00.684
Swiss bank account, which was intended

00:17:00.874 --> 00:17:02.424
to be transferred to the Contras.

00:17:03.154 --> 00:17:06.044
Funnily enough, North made a mistake

00:17:06.084 --> 00:17:08.584
with the account number, and it

00:17:08.584 --> 00:17:10.714
was transferred to a 60-year-old

00:17:10.724 --> 00:17:12.394
Swiss businessman instead.

00:17:13.074 --> 00:17:15.944
And perhaps even more bizarrely, the

00:17:15.944 --> 00:17:18.774
man who received this $10 million

00:17:18.774 --> 00:17:21.494
transfer from the Sultan of Brunei didn’t

00:17:21.494 --> 00:17:23.964
question it, but instead transferred

00:17:23.964 --> 00:17:25.284
the money to a different account,

00:17:25.874 --> 00:17:28.174
and would later say he didn’t think

00:17:28.184 --> 00:17:30.244
anything of this large transfer, as

00:17:30.504 --> 00:17:32.634
he was expecting a big deposit anyway.

00:17:33.684 --> 00:17:36.124
He wasn’t prosecuted for this, so

00:17:36.584 --> 00:17:38.144
I guess the lesson there is that if

00:17:38.144 --> 00:17:40.684
you accidentally receive $10 million

00:17:40.684 --> 00:17:42.184
into your bank account from the

00:17:42.184 --> 00:17:44.333
Sultan of Brunei, just say you were

00:17:44.333 --> 00:17:46.443
expecting it and it’ll all be ok.

00:17:47.683 --> 00:17:50.883
Now, North might have had a mix-up with

00:17:50.883 --> 00:17:53.593
the Sultan of Brunei, but he was pretty

00:17:53.593 --> 00:17:55.833
efficient when it came to everything else.

00:17:56.973 --> 00:17:58.723
One of his responsibilities

00:17:58.943 --> 00:18:00.633
was moving the money around

00:18:00.813 --> 00:18:02.663
from the Iranian weapons sales.

00:18:04.193 --> 00:18:08.193
And some time around 1985, it’s thought,

00:18:08.573 --> 00:18:10.413
he noticed something interesting:

00:18:11.363 --> 00:18:14.873
there was $850,000 sitting in a

00:18:14.883 --> 00:18:17.603
Swiss bank account, profit left

00:18:17.623 --> 00:18:20.103
over from the weapons sales to Iran.

00:18:21.133 --> 00:18:23.453
It turned out that Ghorbanifar, true

00:18:23.453 --> 00:18:25.533
to Reagan’s assessment of being a

00:18:25.843 --> 00:18:28.583
“devious character”, had been massively

00:18:28.893 --> 00:18:30.643
overcharging the Iranians for the

00:18:30.643 --> 00:18:33.733
weapons, charging them 600% more.

00:18:34.643 --> 00:18:37.403
This had meant a much bigger commission

00:18:37.583 --> 00:18:39.883
for Ghorbanifar, but it also meant

00:18:40.063 --> 00:18:43.213
that with each trade, the US government

00:18:43.383 --> 00:18:45.203
would make a significant profit.

00:18:46.723 --> 00:18:48.533
What if this money could

00:18:48.543 --> 00:18:51.123
be diverted to the Contras?

00:18:51.763 --> 00:18:55.153
It was all “off the books” anyway, and it

00:18:55.153 --> 00:18:58.913
seemed to provide a neat solution: Iran

00:18:59.223 --> 00:19:02.073
got its weapons, which could, Ghorbanifar

00:19:02.133 --> 00:19:04.063
promised, lead to the return of the

00:19:04.063 --> 00:19:06.813
hostages, the surplus from this would

00:19:06.813 --> 00:19:08.639
go towards the funding of the Contras,

00:19:09.093 --> 00:19:12.173
and this wasn’t technically in violation

00:19:12.173 --> 00:19:14.433
of the Boland Amendment, because the

00:19:14.473 --> 00:19:18.143
NSC staff, as an advisory body in the

00:19:18.143 --> 00:19:21.203
Executive Office, wasn’t explicitly

00:19:21.203 --> 00:19:24.193
named like the CIA or the Pentagon.

00:19:25.003 --> 00:19:27.753
It existed in this legal grey

00:19:27.753 --> 00:19:29.853
area, this legal loophole.

00:19:30.553 --> 00:19:32.873
The world was a geopolitical

00:19:32.903 --> 00:19:35.183
puzzle, and this was how to

00:19:35.183 --> 00:19:37.799
solve it: neatly and tidily.

00:19:38.793 --> 00:19:41.423
So, once the principle was established

00:19:41.523 --> 00:19:44.383
— that money from Iranian arms sales

00:19:44.513 --> 00:19:46.343
could be siphoned off to fund the

00:19:46.353 --> 00:19:49.073
Contras — the operation began to grow.

00:19:49.623 --> 00:19:50.793
More shipments, more

00:19:50.793 --> 00:19:52.653
money, more intermediaries.

00:19:53.103 --> 00:19:57.103
An estimated $3.5 million diverted.

00:19:57.643 --> 00:20:00.983
Swiss bank accounts multiplied, more shady

00:20:00.983 --> 00:20:03.773
middlemen were brought in, and soon there

00:20:03.773 --> 00:20:06.513
was a parallel foreign policy running

00:20:06.563 --> 00:20:08.623
out of the basement of the White House.

00:20:09.273 --> 00:20:12.573
It was complex, it was secret, and it was

00:20:12.573 --> 00:20:15.223
completely outside the reach of Congress.

00:20:16.363 --> 00:20:18.553
It also didn’t really work.

00:20:19.483 --> 00:20:21.053
The more Americans dealt with

00:20:21.083 --> 00:20:23.223
Ghorbanifar and his Iranian contacts,

00:20:23.503 --> 00:20:25.383
the more obvious it became that

00:20:25.383 --> 00:20:27.493
this was a disaster in the making.

00:20:28.313 --> 00:20:30.833
Hostages weren’t really being freed.

00:20:31.333 --> 00:20:32.823
New ones were being taken.

00:20:33.413 --> 00:20:35.796
The Iranians, via Ghorbanifor,

00:20:36.103 --> 00:20:37.863
kept asking for more weapons,

00:20:37.983 --> 00:20:39.933
always promising that the next

00:20:39.933 --> 00:20:42.073
deal would be the last one needed.

00:20:43.403 --> 00:20:45.653
And inside the White House,

00:20:46.153 --> 00:20:48.143
not everyone even agreed on

00:20:48.143 --> 00:20:49.463
what the point of it all was.

00:20:50.193 --> 00:20:52.013
Was this about hostages?

00:20:52.663 --> 00:20:54.333
About opening a channel to Iran?

00:20:54.763 --> 00:20:57.153
Or just about keeping the Contras alive?

00:20:58.263 --> 00:21:00.893
The confusion was only just beginning.

00:21:01.823 --> 00:21:03.813
And what about Reagan himself?

00:21:04.703 --> 00:21:07.323
To this day, historians debate

00:21:07.673 --> 00:21:09.403
exactly how much he knew.

00:21:10.513 --> 00:21:13.663
He was briefed in vague terms,

00:21:13.673 --> 00:21:16.093
he nodded at memos, he signed

00:21:16.093 --> 00:21:18.373
off on broad directions.

00:21:18.763 --> 00:21:20.473
But he never seemed to

00:21:20.473 --> 00:21:22.113
focus on the details.

00:21:22.903 --> 00:21:25.003
This gave his advisers room

00:21:25.003 --> 00:21:27.363
to run, and run they did.

00:21:28.493 --> 00:21:30.493
Later, when the whole affair came

00:21:30.493 --> 00:21:32.903
to light, Reagan would insist he

00:21:32.903 --> 00:21:35.493
hadn’t authorised arms for hostages.

00:21:36.163 --> 00:21:38.933
But even so, even if you believe this

00:21:38.933 --> 00:21:41.283
statement and that he wasn’t leaning

00:21:41.453 --> 00:21:43.503
on his previous career as a Hollywood

00:21:43.503 --> 00:21:46.423
actor, it’s clear that his style of

00:21:46.433 --> 00:21:49.273
leadership — big on vision, light on

00:21:49.283 --> 00:21:51.913
detail — this was what allowed this

00:21:51.913 --> 00:21:53.593
all to happen in the first place.

00:21:54.423 --> 00:21:56.343
So, what happened next?

00:21:56.653 --> 00:21:59.023
Well, it might have all been kept

00:21:59.193 --> 00:22:01.283
under wraps, never revealed to

00:22:01.283 --> 00:22:03.703
the public, had it not been for an

00:22:03.703 --> 00:22:06.123
American aeroplane getting shot down

00:22:06.163 --> 00:22:09.663
over Nicaragua in October of 1986.

00:22:10.583 --> 00:22:13.723
The plane was carrying “60 AK-47

00:22:13.723 --> 00:22:17.773
rifles, 50,000 AK-47 bullets, several

00:22:17.773 --> 00:22:21.083
dozen grenade launchers and 150 pairs

00:22:21.243 --> 00:22:23.963
of jungle boots", not exactly hand

00:22:23.963 --> 00:22:26.313
luggage for a romantic weekend away.

00:22:27.173 --> 00:22:29.833
All but one of the crew were killed.

00:22:30.413 --> 00:22:32.813
The sole survivor was a man named

00:22:32.813 --> 00:22:35.718
Eugene Hasenfus, who jumped out of

00:22:35.753 --> 00:22:38.083
the plane and activated his parachute.

00:22:39.053 --> 00:22:41.183
He was captured with flight logs,

00:22:41.453 --> 00:22:43.883
phone numbers, and documents that

00:22:43.883 --> 00:22:45.973
pointed to an extensive operation.

00:22:46.643 --> 00:22:48.623
He was questioned, and there was

00:22:48.623 --> 00:22:50.473
a press conference in which he

00:22:50.483 --> 00:22:52.443
stated that these flights into

00:22:52.443 --> 00:22:55.683
Nicaragua were the work of the CIA.

00:22:56.533 --> 00:22:59.523
Washington denied it, of course, but

00:22:59.523 --> 00:23:02.413
the crash blew open the Contra side of

00:23:02.413 --> 00:23:06.013
the story: the US government, in direct

00:23:06.253 --> 00:23:08.583
violation of the Boland Amendments,

00:23:08.753 --> 00:23:11.623
was still interfering in Nicaragua.

00:23:12.963 --> 00:23:14.553
And then, less than a month

00:23:14.563 --> 00:23:16.543
later, the other shoe dropped,

00:23:16.833 --> 00:23:18.733
this time from the Middle East.

00:23:20.303 --> 00:23:24.913
On 3 November 1986, a Lebanese newspaper

00:23:25.183 --> 00:23:28.073
published a scoop: the United States

00:23:28.229 --> 00:23:31.363
had secretly shipped missiles to Iran.

00:23:32.643 --> 00:23:35.873
The details were startling: anti-tank

00:23:36.053 --> 00:23:38.463
and anti-aircraft missiles, routed

00:23:38.773 --> 00:23:41.913
through third countries, all supposedly

00:23:42.233 --> 00:23:44.483
to win influence with “moderates” and

00:23:44.483 --> 00:23:47.733
help free hostages in Lebanon, influence

00:23:47.793 --> 00:23:50.433
that had no signs of being won, and

00:23:50.453 --> 00:23:52.483
hostages that were not released.

00:23:53.703 --> 00:23:56.023
Importantly, the two stories

00:23:56.283 --> 00:23:58.283
weren’t initially connected; they

00:23:58.283 --> 00:24:00.893
were two different scandals, and

00:24:01.043 --> 00:24:02.943
were both addressed separately.

00:24:04.563 --> 00:24:06.643
But from that point on,

00:24:06.923 --> 00:24:08.723
events moved quickly.

00:24:09.743 --> 00:24:12.073
On 13 November, Ronald

00:24:12.073 --> 00:24:13.673
Reagan addressed the nation.

00:24:14.303 --> 00:24:16.203
He insisted it hadn’t been

00:24:16.503 --> 00:24:19.463
“arms for hostages.” He spoke of

00:24:19.473 --> 00:24:21.213
reaching out to Iranian moderates.

00:24:21.603 --> 00:24:25.853
But the press and Congress smelled blood.

00:24:26.693 --> 00:24:29.193
And behind the scenes, there was panic.

00:24:29.723 --> 00:24:31.793
An internal investigation was launched.

00:24:32.153 --> 00:24:34.213
In the NSC offices, as

00:24:34.253 --> 00:24:36.363
investigators approached, Oliver

00:24:36.363 --> 00:24:39.043
North and his secretary shredded

00:24:39.293 --> 00:24:41.223
incriminating documents and memos.

00:24:41.533 --> 00:24:44.883
Notes were pulled, files disappeared.

00:24:45.943 --> 00:24:48.813
Unfortunately for them, and fortunately

00:24:48.813 --> 00:24:51.253
for justice and my ability to tell

00:24:51.253 --> 00:24:54.083
this story, some paperwork survived.

00:24:55.123 --> 00:24:57.623
There was an internal review led by the

00:24:57.623 --> 00:25:01.103
Attorney General, and his team found

00:25:01.103 --> 00:25:03.583
what no one had admitted in public:

00:25:04.273 --> 00:25:07.363
profits from the Iran missile sales

00:25:07.673 --> 00:25:10.413
had been diverted to the Contras.

00:25:11.613 --> 00:25:15.243
In that instant, two separate scandals

00:25:15.453 --> 00:25:19.813
snapped together into one: Iran–Contra.

00:25:20.433 --> 00:25:21.863
The cover was gone.

00:25:22.643 --> 00:25:24.583
Congressional hearings followed in

00:25:24.593 --> 00:25:28.263
1987; Oliver North, with his crisp

00:25:28.293 --> 00:25:31.723
uniform, tidy hair, and unflinching tone,

00:25:32.013 --> 00:25:34.893
became the public face of the scandal.

00:25:35.633 --> 00:25:38.563
Appearing in his Marine uniform, Lt.

00:25:38.563 --> 00:25:41.283
Col. North defiantly defended his

00:25:41.283 --> 00:25:43.953
actions, portraying them as patriotic.

00:25:45.123 --> 00:25:48.023
An estimated 55 million Americans

00:25:48.283 --> 00:25:51.043
watched his first day of testimony, and

00:25:51.473 --> 00:25:53.953
“Olliemania” broke out across the country.

00:25:54.473 --> 00:25:56.783
Shirts and bumper stickers were sold,

00:25:56.953 --> 00:25:59.153
supportive prayer vigils were held,

00:25:59.313 --> 00:26:01.483
and hundreds of thousands of dollars

00:26:01.633 --> 00:26:03.773
were collected for his legal fees.

00:26:05.223 --> 00:26:07.843
The jury found North guilty on

00:26:07.843 --> 00:26:10.593
3 of the 12 counts against him.

00:26:11.313 --> 00:26:13.913
He was sentenced to a three-year suspended

00:26:13.913 --> 00:26:16.013
prison term, two years probation,

00:26:16.413 --> 00:26:21.123
$150,000 in fines, and 1,200 hours of

00:26:21.123 --> 00:26:23.433
community service, convictions that

00:26:23.433 --> 00:26:25.983
were all overturned the following year.

00:26:27.193 --> 00:26:28.993
In terms of the others implicated,

00:26:29.463 --> 00:26:31.373
John Poindexter resigned.

00:26:31.603 --> 00:26:33.713
His predecessor, Robert McFarlane,

00:26:33.713 --> 00:26:35.943
was pulled back in for questioning.

00:26:36.723 --> 00:26:38.593
The independent counsel opened

00:26:38.603 --> 00:26:40.383
years of investigations.

00:26:40.753 --> 00:26:42.973
There were more convictions, but

00:26:43.273 --> 00:26:45.283
some were overturned on appeal.

00:26:46.573 --> 00:26:50.073
And in December 1992, then

00:26:50.073 --> 00:26:53.423
President George H. W. Bush issued

00:26:53.423 --> 00:26:55.993
pardons that closed the legal

00:26:55.993 --> 00:26:57.853
book if not the historical one.

00:26:59.293 --> 00:27:02.203
As for the legacy of the affair, well,

00:27:02.573 --> 00:27:04.193
you would be hard-pressed to argue

00:27:04.403 --> 00:27:06.373
that it’s the worst crime committed

00:27:06.553 --> 00:27:08.183
by a sitting American president.

00:27:09.013 --> 00:27:11.673
Historians to this day disagree

00:27:11.673 --> 00:27:13.733
on the extent of Ronald Reagan’s

00:27:13.733 --> 00:27:16.363
involvement, or even the extent to

00:27:16.363 --> 00:27:18.193
which he was aware of the details.

00:27:19.253 --> 00:27:22.093
And even if he knew, there are

00:27:22.103 --> 00:27:24.493
plenty of people who agree with the

00:27:24.493 --> 00:27:28.743
intention: it did, after all, seem like

00:27:28.743 --> 00:27:30.913
a neat solution to several problems.

00:27:31.573 --> 00:27:33.593
“Neat” was indeed the adjective

00:27:33.603 --> 00:27:35.753
North used to describe the idea.

00:27:36.773 --> 00:27:40.543
But it was in clear violation of US law,

00:27:40.943 --> 00:27:42.673
in terms of the financing of the Contras,

00:27:43.023 --> 00:27:46.283
and in contradiction to stated US policy,

00:27:46.603 --> 00:27:49.043
in terms of the sale of arms to Iran.

00:27:50.373 --> 00:27:52.493
To its critics, and Reagan’s

00:27:52.493 --> 00:27:55.133
critics, it was both illegal and

00:27:55.153 --> 00:27:57.843
hypocritical, as well as corrosive to

00:27:57.893 --> 00:27:59.813
constitutional checks and balances.

00:28:00.983 --> 00:28:02.643
And did it work?

00:28:03.183 --> 00:28:05.153
Well, the answer to that is

00:28:05.153 --> 00:28:07.353
more clear-cut: it did not.

00:28:08.253 --> 00:28:11.283
US-Iran relations are still frosty,

00:28:11.633 --> 00:28:14.053
Iran is still designated as a

00:28:14.063 --> 00:28:16.123
major sponsor of terrorist groups

00:28:16.143 --> 00:28:18.703
in the region, Daniel Ortega, the

00:28:18.913 --> 00:28:20.543
then-leader of the Sandinistas,

00:28:20.763 --> 00:28:22.993
is still President of Nicaragua,

00:28:23.513 --> 00:28:26.323
and for Hezbollah, taking hostages

00:28:26.503 --> 00:28:28.423
hasn’t exactly gone out of fashion.

00:28:29.643 --> 00:28:32.013
And as for the question of whether

00:28:32.023 --> 00:28:34.083
subsequent US Presidents learned

00:28:34.103 --> 00:28:36.433
any lessons from it, well, I’ll

00:28:36.433 --> 00:28:38.343
let you be the judge of that.

00:28:39.673 --> 00:28:41.633
OK, then, that is it for today's

00:28:41.653 --> 00:28:43.903
episode on the Iran-Contra scandal.

00:28:44.243 --> 00:28:46.413
I know it was quite a complicated one,

00:28:46.723 --> 00:28:48.813
with lots of moving parts and people

00:28:48.823 --> 00:28:51.123
to keep track of, but I guess that’s

00:28:51.123 --> 00:28:53.003
what happens when you conduct a game

00:28:53.003 --> 00:28:55.463
of geopolitical chess, involving Swiss

00:28:55.503 --> 00:28:57.993
bank accounts, American missiles, sworn

00:28:58.013 --> 00:29:00.363
enemies and Central American guerrillas.

00:29:01.123 --> 00:29:03.023
You've been listening to English Learning

00:29:03.023 --> 00:29:05.573
for Curious Minds by Leonardo English.

00:29:05.963 --> 00:29:08.553
I'm Alastair Budge, you stay safe, and

00:29:08.553 --> 00:29:10.883
I'll catch you in the next episode.
