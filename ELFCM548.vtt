Hello, hello, hello, and welcome

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:09.920
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.850
Minds, by Leonardo English, the show

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.690
where you can listen to fascinating

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.060
stories and learn weird and wonderful

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.049
things about the world at the same

00:00:19.049 --> 00:00:21.019
time as improving your English.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.880
I'm Alastair Budge, and today

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:25.480
we are going to be talking

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.919
about the Salem Witch Trials.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.710
It’s a story of suspicion, the devil,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.270
witchcraft–alleged witchcraft, I

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.950
should add–mass hysteria, hints

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.079
of psychedelic drugs, and justice.

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:43.259
OK then, let’s step into

00:00:43.259 --> 00:00:45.689
the icy, unsettling world

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:47.809
of the Salem Witch Trials.

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:51.689
The winter of 1692 was

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:54.369
particularly cold in Massachusetts.

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:57.059
The temperature rarely got above

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:59.539
freezing point, and many of the

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:01.679
ponds and rivers had been frozen

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:04.029
over since late the previous year.

00:01:04.889 --> 00:01:07.149
In the small village of Salem,

00:01:07.455 --> 00:01:10.258
the 500 or so Puritan settlers did

00:01:10.308 --> 00:01:12.478
everything they could to stay warm.

00:01:13.458 --> 00:01:15.258
Church was, of course,

00:01:15.298 --> 00:01:16.668
a regular occurrence.

00:01:16.968 --> 00:01:19.508
This was a highly religious community.

00:01:20.228 --> 00:01:23.108
And what these god-fearing men and women

00:01:23.378 --> 00:01:27.138
feared the most was, naturally, the devil.

00:01:28.058 --> 00:01:30.138
In Salem Village, the devil

00:01:30.248 --> 00:01:32.268
wasn’t just a story whispered

00:01:32.318 --> 00:01:34.568
to scare children; he was real.

00:01:35.788 --> 00:01:38.988
To the 500 or so Puritans huddled

00:01:39.208 --> 00:01:41.818
in their icy wooden homes, he was an

00:01:41.888 --> 00:01:44.558
ever-present enemy, lurking in the

00:01:44.558 --> 00:01:48.078
shadows, waiting to snatch their souls.

00:01:48.868 --> 00:01:51.458
But why were they so afraid?

00:01:51.588 --> 00:01:54.258
Why did this small, God-fearing community

00:01:54.498 --> 00:01:57.318
see the devil behind every misfortune?

00:01:58.648 --> 00:02:01.398
Well, these settlers weren’t just a

00:02:01.428 --> 00:02:03.718
random collection of English people,

00:02:04.078 --> 00:02:07.198
they were Puritans, a group so strict,

00:02:07.408 --> 00:02:09.538
so devoted, that they’d crossed

00:02:09.578 --> 00:02:12.178
an ocean to build a ‘pure’ life.

00:02:12.978 --> 00:02:15.338
Back in England, their parents or

00:02:15.348 --> 00:02:17.848
grandparents had watched the Protestant

00:02:17.858 --> 00:02:20.778
Reformation unfold, and they believed

00:02:20.978 --> 00:02:23.408
the Church of England, the Protestant

00:02:23.458 --> 00:02:26.158
church, hadn’t gone far enough to

00:02:26.158 --> 00:02:28.878
strip away Catholic influences.

00:02:29.698 --> 00:02:32.318
So they sailed across the Atlantic,

00:02:32.588 --> 00:02:34.688
dreaming of a holy community,

00:02:34.938 --> 00:02:37.138
a shining “city upon a hill”.

00:02:38.198 --> 00:02:41.238
But that dream came with a catch:

00:02:41.868 --> 00:02:44.378
if they were God’s chosen people,

00:02:44.868 --> 00:02:46.478
and of course, they fervently

00:02:46.478 --> 00:02:48.878
believed that they were, the devil

00:02:48.928 --> 00:02:50.968
would surely try to destroy them.

00:02:52.548 --> 00:02:56.588
And in early 1692, life gave

00:02:56.588 --> 00:02:58.648
them plenty of reasons to feel

00:02:58.648 --> 00:03:01.028
that the devil was edging closer.

00:03:01.868 --> 00:03:04.428
The winter was brutal, crops

00:03:04.488 --> 00:03:07.378
had failed, smallpox had swept

00:03:07.388 --> 00:03:09.878
through, and Indian raids from the

00:03:09.878 --> 00:03:12.368
north had left families grieving.

00:03:13.218 --> 00:03:15.058
Every creak of the floorboards,

00:03:15.288 --> 00:03:17.418
every howl of the wind through the

00:03:17.418 --> 00:03:19.788
frozen trees, felt like a sign.

00:03:21.028 --> 00:03:23.028
The Puritans believed the devil

00:03:23.028 --> 00:03:25.578
wasn’t some distant figure, someone

00:03:25.788 --> 00:03:27.738
you might meet in hell if you didn’t

00:03:27.738 --> 00:03:30.468
live a god-fearing life; he was here,

00:03:31.008 --> 00:03:33.168
or rather, his secret servants were.

00:03:34.078 --> 00:03:37.138
These servants were witches, people,

00:03:37.548 --> 00:03:40.448
almost exclusively women, who had made a

00:03:40.518 --> 00:03:43.738
pact with Satan, a deal with the devil.

00:03:44.908 --> 00:03:47.798
And they weren’t random strangers;

00:03:48.068 --> 00:03:50.148
they were neighbours, friends, even

00:03:50.158 --> 00:03:52.948
family, who were working with the devil.

00:03:54.228 --> 00:03:56.298
His tricks were clever: he could

00:03:56.298 --> 00:03:59.318
send ‘spectres,’ invisible spirits,

00:03:59.558 --> 00:04:02.158
to pinch or choke you in the night.

00:04:02.678 --> 00:04:04.918
He could turn your cow’s milk sour or

00:04:04.918 --> 00:04:07.788
make your children fall ill and die.

00:04:08.608 --> 00:04:11.708
Every Sunday, Reverend Samuel Parris, the

00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:14.778
village minister, would stand in front of

00:04:14.778 --> 00:04:18.008
his congregation and preach exactly this.

00:04:18.288 --> 00:04:20.598
Beware the devil; he has evil

00:04:20.628 --> 00:04:22.938
and cunning ways, and he is

00:04:22.948 --> 00:04:24.968
sending witches to test you.

00:04:26.438 --> 00:04:30.278
Perhaps it all sounded theoretical, but

00:04:30.668 --> 00:04:34.608
in January of 1692, he noticed something

00:04:34.628 --> 00:04:37.688
unusual happening in his own house.

00:04:38.628 --> 00:04:40.992
His daughter, Betty, and her cousin

00:04:41.042 --> 00:04:44.092
Abigail, started behaving strangely.

00:04:44.962 --> 00:04:47.212
They were only 9 and 11 years

00:04:47.212 --> 00:04:49.662
old, but suddenly, they weren’t

00:04:49.682 --> 00:04:51.212
acting like children anymore.

00:04:51.982 --> 00:04:54.462
They twitched and shook, cried

00:04:54.472 --> 00:04:56.692
out in pain, and complained

00:04:56.692 --> 00:04:59.052
of being pinched or bitten.

00:05:00.372 --> 00:05:02.432
But there was nothing there.

00:05:02.862 --> 00:05:04.582
It wasn’t mice, it wasn’t

00:05:04.582 --> 00:05:06.752
some pest, or bed bugs.

00:05:07.012 --> 00:05:09.172
They seemed to be being attacked

00:05:09.472 --> 00:05:11.609
by some invisible force.

00:05:13.125 --> 00:05:14.815
At first, it might have

00:05:14.815 --> 00:05:16.515
seemed like a sickness.

00:05:17.145 --> 00:05:18.905
After all, the winter had been

00:05:18.905 --> 00:05:21.965
harsh, and disease wasn’t uncommon.

00:05:22.725 --> 00:05:25.025
But when a local doctor examined

00:05:25.025 --> 00:05:27.785
them and found no clear cause,

00:05:28.155 --> 00:05:30.515
he gave an altogether different

00:05:30.715 --> 00:05:33.535
explanation: witchcraft.

00:05:34.975 --> 00:05:38.355
To the Puritans, this made perfect sense.

00:05:38.755 --> 00:05:41.275
If the devil was real, and his

00:05:41.275 --> 00:05:43.405
witches were among them, then

00:05:43.415 --> 00:05:45.865
these girls were under attack.

00:05:47.082 --> 00:05:50.015
Word spread quickly through the village.

00:05:50.544 --> 00:05:54.066
Salem was small, only about 500 people, so

00:05:54.346 --> 00:05:56.906
news travelled fast, from house to house,

00:05:57.176 --> 00:06:00.466
whispered over fences and church pews.

00:06:01.646 --> 00:06:03.926
Soon, other girls in the village

00:06:04.176 --> 00:06:06.316
started showing the same signs.

00:06:07.186 --> 00:06:10.276
Ann Putnam Jr., a 12-year-old from

00:06:10.276 --> 00:06:12.669
a powerful family, and Mercy Lewis,

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:15.239
a 17-year-old servant, joined

00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:17.889
Betty and Abigail in their fits.

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:21.379
They screamed about invisible tormentors,

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:24.389
pointed fingers, and named names.

00:06:25.399 --> 00:06:27.639
The first to be accused were the

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:29.499
kind of people you might expect

00:06:29.709 --> 00:06:31.369
in a suspicious little village:

00:06:31.756 --> 00:06:34.276
outcasts, people on the edges.

00:06:34.956 --> 00:06:37.816
There was Sarah Good, a beggar who

00:06:37.816 --> 00:06:40.116
smoked a pipe and muttered under her

00:06:40.126 --> 00:06:42.496
breath when anyone refused her charity.

00:06:43.636 --> 00:06:46.226
Then Sarah Osborne, an older woman

00:06:46.456 --> 00:06:48.686
who’d shocked the village by marrying

00:06:48.686 --> 00:06:51.516
her servant and committing the most

00:06:51.516 --> 00:06:54.500
scandalous crime of all: skipping church.

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:58.960
And finally, Tituba, a black slave woman

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:01.900
who worked in Reverend Parris’s own home.

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:05.496
Now, not much is known about Tituba.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.940
It’s thought she might have come from

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:11.120
the Caribbean, perhaps Haiti, and if so,

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:14.090
she may well have told the girls stories

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:17.460
about Vodoo, spirits and fortune-telling.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:20.780
These might have sounded weird and

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:23.840
fascinating, but with the accusation

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:26.750
of witchcraft, to her Puritan master,

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:29.680
they sounded like the work of the devil.

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.700
Under pressure, Tituba confessed.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:36.290
She was questioned for days, beaten, and

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:39.160
likely told that confessing could save her

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.320
life, while denying it would mean death.

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:45.600
In a village gripped by fear,

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:48.010
she had little choice but to give

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:50.360
them what they wanted: a story.

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:53.250
She described visions of black

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:56.710
dogs, red cats, and witches flying

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:58.680
through the air, details that

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:00.850
matched Puritan fears perfectly.

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:05.270
She said she’d met the devil, that he’d

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:08.746
asked her to serve him, and that she’d

00:08:08.746 --> 00:08:11.386
seen other witches in Salem signing

00:08:11.386 --> 00:08:14.606
his book, a sort of evil guest list.

00:08:15.666 --> 00:08:17.146
Her confession wasn’t

00:08:17.156 --> 00:08:19.596
just a story; it was fuel.

00:08:20.386 --> 00:08:22.516
Suddenly, the village had

00:08:22.576 --> 00:08:24.776
proof, or so they thought.

00:08:25.276 --> 00:08:27.786
If Tituba was a witch, then

00:08:27.786 --> 00:08:29.566
the girls’ fits weren’t

00:08:29.606 --> 00:08:31.656
imagination; they were evidence.

00:08:32.776 --> 00:08:35.426
And if there were more witches out there,

00:08:35.746 --> 00:08:38.476
as Tituba claimed, no one was safe.

00:08:39.586 --> 00:08:41.596
Soon, fingers started to

00:08:41.596 --> 00:08:43.596
be pointed every which way.

00:08:44.386 --> 00:08:45.946
The accusations didn’t

00:08:45.946 --> 00:08:47.266
stop with the outcasts.

00:08:47.806 --> 00:08:50.926
They spread to people no one expected: a

00:08:50.936 --> 00:08:53.526
71-year-old grandmother who went to church

00:08:53.546 --> 00:08:56.556
every Sunday and a well-respected farmer.

00:08:57.286 --> 00:08:59.906
When a woman named Martha Corey, who was

00:08:59.906 --> 00:09:02.846
in her 70s at the time, dared to question

00:09:03.036 --> 00:09:05.336
if the girls were telling the truth, she

00:09:05.336 --> 00:09:07.966
found herself accused of being a witch.

00:09:08.516 --> 00:09:11.556
Her husband, Giles Corey, an 80-year-old

00:09:11.556 --> 00:09:14.496
farmer, was another one of the few who

00:09:14.496 --> 00:09:17.726
refused to play along, and of course, he

00:09:17.726 --> 00:09:20.026
found himself accused of witchcraft too.

00:09:20.966 --> 00:09:23.566
He wouldn’t confess or deny the charges,

00:09:23.846 --> 00:09:26.886
so the court ordered him to be pressed

00:09:27.156 --> 00:09:29.946
under heavy stones, a terrible torture

00:09:30.266 --> 00:09:32.316
intended to get him to realise the

00:09:32.346 --> 00:09:34.696
error of his ways and corroborate.

00:09:35.656 --> 00:09:38.116
For two days, he lay there, saying

00:09:38.116 --> 00:09:41.456
only ‘More weight,’ until he died, a

00:09:41.456 --> 00:09:43.806
stubborn stand against the madness.

00:09:44.496 --> 00:09:47.496
His wife was executed three days later.

00:09:48.646 --> 00:09:51.826
In a village of 500, where everyone knew

00:09:51.826 --> 00:09:54.616
each other, this had become personal.

00:09:55.296 --> 00:09:58.046
Neighbour turned against neighbour, enemy

00:09:58.246 --> 00:10:01.116
against enemy, friend against friend.

00:10:01.876 --> 00:10:04.446
By spring, the panic had grown

00:10:04.446 --> 00:10:06.936
so big that the local magistrates

00:10:07.126 --> 00:10:08.366
couldn’t handle it anymore.

00:10:09.228 --> 00:10:11.606
A special court was set up in Salem

00:10:11.606 --> 00:10:14.586
Town, just a few miles away, to deal

00:10:14.586 --> 00:10:16.796
with the growing list of the accused.

00:10:17.866 --> 00:10:21.156
And here’s where things got even stranger:

00:10:21.766 --> 00:10:24.696
the court didn’t rely on normal evidence,

00:10:24.756 --> 00:10:27.686
like witnesses or proof you could touch.

00:10:28.146 --> 00:10:31.036
They used ‘spectral evidence’, the

00:10:31.036 --> 00:10:33.046
idea that the devil could send a

00:10:33.046 --> 00:10:35.350
witch’s spirit to harm someone, even

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:37.609
if her body were somewhere else.

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:41.240
If a girl screamed in court and

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.650
said she saw Sarah Good’s spectre

00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:45.810
choking her, that was enough.

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:48.550
It didn’t matter if Sarah was standing

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:50.890
right there, clearly not doing anything

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:52.810
other than trying to defend herself.

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:57.200
To the Puritans, the invisible world was

00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:00.380
just as real as the frozen ponds outside.

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:04.540
As you might imagine, the courtroom was a

00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:08.280
mess: girls fainting, judges pushing for

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:12.070
guilty verdicts, and even a ‘touch test’

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:15.450
where if an accused touched a girl and

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:18.660
her fits stopped, it was proof of guilt.

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:23.080
By summer, the jails were full,

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:24.850
and the gallows were busy.

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:28.260
Nineteen people were hanged that year.

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:31.030
Five more died in prison,

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:33.370
including Sarah Osborne, who was

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:36.080
worn out by illness and chains.

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:39.090
And Giles Corey, of course,

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:41.460
met his end under the stones.

00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:44.380
But it couldn’t go on forever.

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:48.760
By late summer, the accusations had become

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:51.690
a form of village retribution, a way to

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:53.960
settle scores with quarrelling neighbours.

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:57.430
If there was a dispute over land or

00:11:57.620 --> 00:11:59.530
some feeling of being wronged in the

00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:01.640
past, what better way to get your

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:03.950
vengeance than accusing your enemy

00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:05.770
of being in bed with the devil?

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:09.420
In fact, it took the accusations

00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:11.940
to reach the very top of Puritan

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:14.193
society for the madness to end.

00:12:15.243 --> 00:12:17.723
People began pointing fingers at

00:12:17.723 --> 00:12:20.383
the wives of important men, like

00:12:20.383 --> 00:12:22.733
the wife of Governor William Phips,

00:12:22.896 --> 00:12:24.943
who was in charge of Massachusetts.

00:12:25.533 --> 00:12:28.000
This was a step too far.

00:12:28.723 --> 00:12:31.033
Phips had been away, dealing with

00:12:31.073 --> 00:12:33.843
Indian wars up north, but when he

00:12:33.843 --> 00:12:38.123
returned in October 1692, he saw the

00:12:38.123 --> 00:12:41.263
chaos and shut the special court down.

00:12:42.373 --> 00:12:44.523
Or, more cynically, he might have

00:12:44.523 --> 00:12:46.053
thought, “I don’t mind people

00:12:46.053 --> 00:12:47.673
accusing other people’s wives of

00:12:47.683 --> 00:12:49.573
being a witch, but you’re not going

00:12:49.573 --> 00:12:51.783
to accuse my wife of witchcraft!”

00:12:53.033 --> 00:12:55.243
He banned spectral evidence,

00:12:55.383 --> 00:12:56.733
saying it wasn’t reliable.

00:12:57.333 --> 00:12:58.533
Of course, it wasn’t reliable;

00:12:58.833 --> 00:13:01.433
it was invisible and was one

00:13:01.433 --> 00:13:03.483
person’s word against another's.

00:13:04.623 --> 00:13:07.263
Without that, most of the cases fell

00:13:07.263 --> 00:13:09.533
apart because there was no evidence.

00:13:10.113 --> 00:13:12.663
The trials slowed, then stopped.

00:13:13.223 --> 00:13:17.333
By early 1693, the jails started to empty.

00:13:18.223 --> 00:13:21.583
Tituba, who’d confessed, was sold to a new

00:13:21.603 --> 00:13:24.033
owner and disappeared from the records.

00:13:24.513 --> 00:13:27.853
The girls, Betty, Abigail, Ann and

00:13:27.853 --> 00:13:30.913
Mercy, went quiet, their fits fading

00:13:30.913 --> 00:13:33.273
away as the village tried to move on.

00:13:34.183 --> 00:13:38.013
Years later, in 1706, Ann Putnam

00:13:38.033 --> 00:13:41.163
Jr. stood in church and apologised.

00:13:41.743 --> 00:13:43.983
She said she’d been tricked–by

00:13:43.993 --> 00:13:45.693
the devil, she claimed–and

00:13:45.833 --> 00:13:47.313
hadn’t meant to hurt anyone.

00:13:48.533 --> 00:13:51.493
By then, 20 people were dead, and

00:13:51.663 --> 00:13:54.373
Salem was a village full of scars.

00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:57.981
In the immediate aftermath, there

00:13:57.981 --> 00:14:00.101
were movements to try to undo

00:14:00.371 --> 00:14:02.581
some of the damage, or at least

00:14:02.761 --> 00:14:05.021
acknowledge the sheer insanity of it.

00:14:05.891 --> 00:14:08.461
In 1702, the trials

00:14:08.601 --> 00:14:10.411
were declared unlawful.

00:14:11.181 --> 00:14:14.481
Then, in 1711, the government passed

00:14:14.481 --> 00:14:16.991
a law to restore the rights and good

00:14:16.991 --> 00:14:19.061
names of many who’d been condemned.

00:14:19.511 --> 00:14:21.011
They even paid some money to the

00:14:21.011 --> 00:14:23.991
families, a token compensation

00:14:23.991 --> 00:14:25.651
payment by way of apology.

00:14:26.351 --> 00:14:28.911
It wasn’t much, but it was something.

00:14:30.021 --> 00:14:32.481
Still, not everyone was included.

00:14:33.151 --> 00:14:35.221
Seven people’s names stayed

00:14:35.251 --> 00:14:36.331
on the list of the guilty,

00:14:36.701 --> 00:14:38.791
forgotten by that first effort.

00:14:39.761 --> 00:14:42.221
It wasn’t until 1957 that

00:14:42.221 --> 00:14:44.461
Massachusetts said sorry and tried

00:14:44.461 --> 00:14:46.961
to fix it again, clearing more names.

00:14:47.331 --> 00:14:51.171
But one person, a woman named Elizabeth

00:14:51.191 --> 00:14:54.481
Johnson Jr., was somehow missed out.

00:14:55.161 --> 00:14:56.841
She’d been accused and

00:14:56.861 --> 00:14:59.431
convicted but not hanged.

00:15:00.201 --> 00:15:04.231
She died of natural causes in 1747 at

00:15:04.271 --> 00:15:08.201
the ripe old age of 77 but with no living

00:15:08.201 --> 00:15:10.651
descendants to fight to clear her name,

00:15:11.094 --> 00:15:13.804
legally speaking, she was still a witch.

00:15:14.604 --> 00:15:18.554
However, more than 300 years after this

00:15:18.584 --> 00:15:21.474
conviction, she found some unlikely

00:15:21.474 --> 00:15:24.354
supporters in the form of a particularly

00:15:24.354 --> 00:15:26.544
creative teacher called Carrie

00:15:26.544 --> 00:15:29.544
LaPierre and her middle school class.

00:15:30.864 --> 00:15:33.374
Mrs LaPierre found out about Elizabeth

00:15:33.394 --> 00:15:36.394
Johnson Jr and set her eighth-grade

00:15:36.404 --> 00:15:39.774
class a project: clear her name.

00:15:40.764 --> 00:15:43.444
The class worked tirelessly, collating

00:15:43.454 --> 00:15:46.214
records and writing letters, and in

00:15:46.214 --> 00:15:50.354
2022, a bill was passed that officially

00:15:50.524 --> 00:15:53.114
exonerated Elizabeth Johnson Jr.,

00:15:53.474 --> 00:15:55.774
thereby clearing the last convicted

00:15:55.774 --> 00:15:57.894
person in the Salem Witch Trials.

00:15:59.304 --> 00:16:00.954
Of course, she should never have

00:16:00.954 --> 00:16:02.444
been convicted in the first place,

00:16:02.768 --> 00:16:05.134
but it was better than nothing, and

00:16:05.304 --> 00:16:07.504
Mrs LaPierre definitely deserves

00:16:07.514 --> 00:16:09.714
some sort of prize for devising

00:16:09.734 --> 00:16:11.574
such an interesting class project.

00:16:12.384 --> 00:16:15.234
So, if we are to conclude that

00:16:15.234 --> 00:16:17.314
the residents of Salem were not

00:16:17.354 --> 00:16:19.364
being challenged by the devil, and

00:16:19.564 --> 00:16:21.454
there was not a mass transformation

00:16:21.664 --> 00:16:23.444
of the female population into

00:16:23.444 --> 00:16:25.484
witches, what was going on?

00:16:26.544 --> 00:16:28.764
Well, people have been trying to

00:16:28.764 --> 00:16:30.204
figure that out for centuries,

00:16:30.483 --> 00:16:32.827
and there are a few theories.

00:16:33.987 --> 00:16:35.927
One idea is that it all

00:16:35.927 --> 00:16:37.667
came down to a fungus.

00:16:38.137 --> 00:16:39.497
Ergot, to be exact.

00:16:40.547 --> 00:16:43.907
Ergot grows on rye, a grain the

00:16:43.937 --> 00:16:45.937
Puritans used to make bread.

00:16:47.057 --> 00:16:50.057
If the weather is wet and warm, like

00:16:50.057 --> 00:16:51.787
it might have been in the summer

00:16:51.807 --> 00:16:55.327
of 1691, ergot can spread fast.

00:16:56.277 --> 00:16:58.077
Now, here’s the strange part.

00:16:58.477 --> 00:17:00.937
Ergot contains natural chemicals

00:17:01.187 --> 00:17:03.677
that are similar to LSD, the

00:17:03.697 --> 00:17:05.367
powerful hallucinogenic drug

00:17:05.617 --> 00:17:08.097
that became famous in the 1960s.

00:17:08.945 --> 00:17:12.005
LSD causes people to see and

00:17:12.005 --> 00:17:14.895
feel things that aren’t real, and

00:17:15.164 --> 00:17:16.895
ergot can do something similar.

00:17:17.825 --> 00:17:20.615
If someone eats bread made with infected

00:17:20.615 --> 00:17:22.944
rye, they might become very sick,

00:17:23.114 --> 00:17:25.374
have convulsions, feel like they’re

00:17:25.404 --> 00:17:28.524
being pinched or burned, or even

00:17:28.554 --> 00:17:30.854
see things that aren’t really there.

00:17:31.894 --> 00:17:33.844
In other words, make people do

00:17:34.064 --> 00:17:36.144
exactly what the young girls did.

00:17:37.174 --> 00:17:39.364
Some historians think this could

00:17:39.364 --> 00:17:40.894
explain the strange behaviour,

00:17:41.434 --> 00:17:43.904
not witches, just bad bread.

00:17:45.074 --> 00:17:46.884
But not everyone agrees.

00:17:47.214 --> 00:17:49.834
The symptoms don’t match perfectly,

00:17:49.994 --> 00:17:52.484
nor does the timeline, and ergot

00:17:52.534 --> 00:17:54.584
poisoning would’ve hit more people,

00:17:54.864 --> 00:17:56.904
not just a handful of girls.

00:17:58.204 --> 00:18:01.884
Another theory is simpler: mass hysteria.

00:18:02.634 --> 00:18:05.414
Salem was a pressure cooker; harsh

00:18:05.434 --> 00:18:08.134
winters, failed crops, disease,

00:18:08.394 --> 00:18:10.434
and attacks from nearby tribes

00:18:10.604 --> 00:18:12.374
had nearly everyone on edge.

00:18:13.314 --> 00:18:15.384
Add in their deep fear of the

00:18:15.384 --> 00:18:17.254
devil, and it wouldn’t have

00:18:17.254 --> 00:18:19.264
taken much to spark panic.

00:18:20.164 --> 00:18:22.294
When the girls started twitching

00:18:22.294 --> 00:18:24.344
and shouting, the village was

00:18:24.344 --> 00:18:25.864
ready to believe the worst.

00:18:26.594 --> 00:18:29.574
Fear spread like wildfire, and

00:18:29.574 --> 00:18:32.094
soon, people saw witches everywhere

00:18:32.464 --> 00:18:33.771
because they expected to.

00:18:34.564 --> 00:18:36.214
The girls might have kept it

00:18:36.224 --> 00:18:38.964
going, maybe for attention, maybe

00:18:39.044 --> 00:18:40.824
out of fear themselves, while

00:18:41.044 --> 00:18:43.134
adults fuelled the flames with

00:18:43.184 --> 00:18:45.524
old grudges and power struggles.

00:18:46.864 --> 00:18:48.714
Then there’s the idea of

00:18:48.884 --> 00:18:51.204
plain old jealousy and spite.

00:18:52.054 --> 00:18:54.864
Salem was tiny, 500 people, and

00:18:55.104 --> 00:18:57.524
everyone knew everyone else’s business.

00:18:58.314 --> 00:19:00.304
Sarah Good was poor and

00:19:00.324 --> 00:19:02.514
bitter; Sarah Osborne broke the

00:19:02.514 --> 00:19:05.284
rules; Tituba was an outsider.

00:19:06.114 --> 00:19:08.004
Accusing them could settle

00:19:08.004 --> 00:19:10.014
scores or shift blame.

00:19:11.144 --> 00:19:14.287
Once it started, it snowballed; people

00:19:14.287 --> 00:19:16.567
piled on, afraid of being accused

00:19:16.567 --> 00:19:18.627
themselves if they didn’t join in.

00:19:20.137 --> 00:19:21.777
So, which is it?

00:19:22.267 --> 00:19:24.567
Maybe a bit of all three: some

00:19:24.577 --> 00:19:26.839
sickness, a lot of fear, and

00:19:26.879 --> 00:19:28.639
plenty of human messiness.

00:19:29.789 --> 00:19:31.869
Now, to wrap things up, this

00:19:31.909 --> 00:19:33.589
was a weird period indeed.

00:19:33.959 --> 00:19:37.179
15 months, more than 200 people accused,

00:19:37.459 --> 00:19:39.529
the vast majority of whom were women.

00:19:40.719 --> 00:19:42.769
Nineteen people were hanged, one

00:19:42.819 --> 00:19:44.629
eighty-year-old man crushed to

00:19:44.629 --> 00:19:47.019
death under heavy stones, and

00:19:47.139 --> 00:19:49.389
at least five more died in jail.

00:19:50.189 --> 00:19:52.009
It was a miscarriage of justice

00:19:52.299 --> 00:19:55.579
indeed, and to think, it might

00:19:55.619 --> 00:19:58.319
all have come down to bad bread.

00:19:59.899 --> 00:20:02.149
OK then, that is it for today's

00:20:02.159 --> 00:20:04.369
episode on the Salem Witch Trials.

00:20:04.649 --> 00:20:05.889
I hope it's been an interesting one,

00:20:06.149 --> 00:20:07.839
and that you've learnt something new.

00:20:08.279 --> 00:20:09.659
If you enjoyed it, we have

00:20:09.659 --> 00:20:11.539
another episode on the history of

00:20:11.599 --> 00:20:14.809
witches, it’s episode number 322.

00:20:15.033 --> 00:20:16.370
I'll put a link in the show notes

00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:17.690
if you'd like to listen to that one.

00:20:17.976 --> 00:20:19.491
And we have a bunch of other

00:20:19.746 --> 00:20:21.526
“horror”-themed episodes, or

00:20:21.686 --> 00:20:23.496
ones about “weird history” too.

00:20:23.966 --> 00:20:26.136
Just click on the “horror” or “weird

00:20:26.136 --> 00:20:27.826
history” tab if you’re listening on

00:20:27.826 --> 00:20:30.176
our website, and I’ll put some links to

00:20:30.176 --> 00:20:32.126
all of those in the show notes as well.

00:20:32.606 --> 00:20:34.396
You've been listening to English Learning

00:20:34.396 --> 00:20:37.076
