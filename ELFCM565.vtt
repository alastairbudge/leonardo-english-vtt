Hello, hello, hello, and welcome

00:00:07.818 --> 00:00:09.798
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.798 --> 00:00:12.718
Minds, by Leonardo English, the show

00:00:12.728 --> 00:00:14.538
where you can listen to fascinating

00:00:14.538 --> 00:00:17.058
stories and learn weird and wonderful

00:00:17.068 --> 00:00:19.148
things about the world at the same

00:00:19.148 --> 00:00:20.968
time as improving your English.

00:00:21.538 --> 00:00:24.358
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we

00:00:24.358 --> 00:00:26.638
have an unusual type of episode.

00:00:27.038 --> 00:00:28.288
I’m not going to talk about a

00:00:28.288 --> 00:00:30.758
person’s life, a historical event,

00:00:31.038 --> 00:00:33.048
or some other weird and wonderful

00:00:33.058 --> 00:00:34.508
thing going on in the world.

00:00:35.168 --> 00:00:37.898
Today, I’m going to talk to you about

00:00:37.908 --> 00:00:41.258
how I choose, research, write and

00:00:41.278 --> 00:00:44.108
produce podcast episodes, and how

00:00:44.118 --> 00:00:46.198
this process has changed over the

00:00:46.198 --> 00:00:48.518
past almost six years of doing so.

00:00:49.318 --> 00:00:51.548
I’ve had quite a few requests for this

00:00:51.578 --> 00:00:54.218
type of episode, and a few weeks ago,

00:00:54.488 --> 00:00:56.748
I got it again from an interesting

00:00:56.758 --> 00:00:58.568
Brazilian member called Itamar.

00:00:58.908 --> 00:01:01.418
So, Itamar, and to everyone else

00:01:01.438 --> 00:01:03.538
listening to this, I hope you’ll enjoy

00:01:03.588 --> 00:01:06.368
this slightly meta type of episode.

00:01:06.828 --> 00:01:08.298
I’m also going to share a bunch of

00:01:08.298 --> 00:01:10.348
things I found out about the kind

00:01:10.348 --> 00:01:12.138
of people who listen to this podcast

00:01:12.368 --> 00:01:14.738
from a recent survey, so I think you

00:01:14.738 --> 00:01:16.298
might find that interesting, too.

00:01:16.798 --> 00:01:19.128
OK then, let’s get right into it.

00:01:20.668 --> 00:01:22.418
Depending on the way you

00:01:22.448 --> 00:01:24.538
calculate it, there are almost

00:01:24.638 --> 00:01:27.404
5 million different podcasts.

00:01:27.808 --> 00:01:31.438
Not individual podcast episodes; 5 million

00:01:31.698 --> 00:01:34.998
podcasts, 5 million different shows.

00:01:35.848 --> 00:01:37.518
As I’m sure you know, there are

00:01:37.518 --> 00:01:40.498
podcasts about everything: comedy,

00:01:40.798 --> 00:01:43.278
TV shows, business, football,

00:01:43.298 --> 00:01:45.988
knitting, fishing, obscure historical

00:01:45.988 --> 00:01:49.808
periods, and, lest I forget, podcasts

00:01:49.988 --> 00:01:51.548
that help you learn a language.

00:01:52.458 --> 00:01:53.938
English Learning for Curious

00:01:53.938 --> 00:01:57.028
Minds–this podcast–is one of those.

00:01:57.988 --> 00:02:00.008
Of course, it isn’t the only one.

00:02:00.038 --> 00:02:02.388
There are tonnes of different podcasts

00:02:02.568 --> 00:02:04.388
that help you learn English, and

00:02:04.658 --> 00:02:07.698
they tend to follow similar formats.

00:02:08.338 --> 00:02:10.798
Some are conversation-based, with

00:02:11.098 --> 00:02:13.308
two teachers having a conversation

00:02:13.318 --> 00:02:15.518
about anything from their personal

00:02:15.518 --> 00:02:17.598
lives to a particular element

00:02:17.778 --> 00:02:19.578
of English grammar or language.

00:02:20.338 --> 00:02:23.178
Others might be one person giving

00:02:23.188 --> 00:02:25.818
motivational advice, or giving

00:02:26.018 --> 00:02:27.518
what’s essentially an English

00:02:27.518 --> 00:02:29.748
lesson in an audio format.

00:02:30.878 --> 00:02:33.158
This one is a little different.

00:02:34.348 --> 00:02:37.408
My approach right from the start has

00:02:37.478 --> 00:02:40.188
always been to present an interesting

00:02:40.188 --> 00:02:42.588
and thought-provoking subject in a

00:02:42.588 --> 00:02:44.998
way that allows you to learn English

00:02:45.338 --> 00:02:48.148
through listening to the episode, and

00:02:48.408 --> 00:02:50.708
allows you to learn weird and wonderful

00:02:50.718 --> 00:02:52.998
things about the world at the same

00:02:52.998 --> 00:02:55.128
time as you improve your English.

00:02:56.008 --> 00:03:01.088
This is now episode 565, so I have had

00:03:01.158 --> 00:03:02.938
quite a bit of practice making them.

00:03:03.518 --> 00:03:07.088
And in this meta episode, I’ll tell you

00:03:07.088 --> 00:03:09.858
what I’ve learned and what the process

00:03:09.878 --> 00:03:12.418
of making an episode looks like now.

00:03:13.468 --> 00:03:15.928
So, let’s go back to the start.

00:03:16.508 --> 00:03:19.508
When I first started, almost six

00:03:19.508 --> 00:03:21.898
years ago now, I had absolutely

00:03:22.138 --> 00:03:23.868
no idea what I was doing.

00:03:24.518 --> 00:03:27.128
I had quite a good idea of what I wanted

00:03:27.158 --> 00:03:29.478
the finished product to look like–a

00:03:29.728 --> 00:03:32.748
15- to 20-minute episode that was both

00:03:32.798 --> 00:03:35.278
interesting and helped people improve

00:03:35.278 --> 00:03:38.028
their English–but I didn’t have much of

00:03:38.028 --> 00:03:40.868
an idea about how to actually make one.

00:03:41.768 --> 00:03:45.348
So…I just started, and figured

00:03:45.518 --> 00:03:47.338
I’d make it up as I went along.

00:03:48.308 --> 00:03:50.878
I chose some topics that I thought

00:03:50.878 --> 00:03:53.258
might be interesting, I did a bunch

00:03:53.258 --> 00:03:56.258
of research into them, and I pulled up

00:03:56.438 --> 00:03:58.558
Google Docs and just started typing.

00:03:59.431 --> 00:04:00.681
When I thought they were good

00:04:00.681 --> 00:04:03.341
enough, I recorded them using a

00:04:03.341 --> 00:04:05.871
microphone I borrowed from a friend.

00:04:06.611 --> 00:04:08.761
Then I listened to them again

00:04:08.841 --> 00:04:11.741
and…I thought they sounded awful.

00:04:12.701 --> 00:04:15.861
Firstly, like most people, I really

00:04:15.871 --> 00:04:17.851
didn’t like the sound of my own voice.

00:04:18.531 --> 00:04:21.371
And secondly, I thought the content of

00:04:21.371 --> 00:04:24.271
the episodes themselves sounded dull.

00:04:24.811 --> 00:04:25.911
I wouldn’t want to listen to

00:04:25.911 --> 00:04:28.341
them, so why should anyone else?

00:04:29.261 --> 00:04:31.601
In fact, I never released

00:04:31.821 --> 00:04:33.151
these early episodes.

00:04:33.531 --> 00:04:36.221
They were on topics I now realise were

00:04:36.261 --> 00:04:38.471
pretty difficult to make interesting in

00:04:38.471 --> 00:04:41.751
an audio-only format: there was one on

00:04:41.751 --> 00:04:45.341
how black holes work, and another one on

00:04:45.521 --> 00:04:48.011
how the international bond market works.

00:04:48.581 --> 00:04:51.591
Interesting and important subjects, sure,

00:04:51.951 --> 00:04:54.421
but quite hard to turn into an interesting

00:04:54.421 --> 00:04:57.731
topic for someone at B1 or B2 level.

00:04:58.391 --> 00:05:01.391
So, I scrapped them - they simply

00:05:01.401 --> 00:05:03.011
never saw the light of day.

00:05:04.131 --> 00:05:07.091
I decided to choose some slightly easier

00:05:07.131 --> 00:05:09.901
subjects to tackle, and things that I

00:05:09.901 --> 00:05:13.341
was more familiar with, and got cracking.

00:05:14.521 --> 00:05:18.311
That was in December 2019, coming

00:05:18.311 --> 00:05:20.831
on 6 years ago now, and I have

00:05:20.831 --> 00:05:23.141
just kept going, with a few changes

00:05:23.351 --> 00:05:24.891
and improvements along the way.

00:05:25.531 --> 00:05:28.641
So, how does it work now?

00:05:29.281 --> 00:05:32.901
Well, first comes the idea for the topic.

00:05:33.731 --> 00:05:35.861
If you are a seasoned listener to

00:05:35.861 --> 00:05:37.661
this show, you’ll know that we’ve

00:05:37.671 --> 00:05:40.181
covered a lot of different subjects.

00:05:40.601 --> 00:05:42.991
There’s been everything from episodes

00:05:42.991 --> 00:05:45.221
about the life of disappeared English

00:05:45.261 --> 00:05:47.501
aristocrats through to stories about the

00:05:47.501 --> 00:05:51.141
Vikings, how recycling works, conspiracies

00:05:51.261 --> 00:05:53.641
from ancient times, the list goes on.

00:05:54.381 --> 00:05:56.721
There are only really three things

00:05:56.951 --> 00:06:00.301
that need to be true for me to decide

00:06:00.381 --> 00:06:02.031
that they are worthy of an episode.

00:06:02.954 --> 00:06:05.214
Firstly, I need to find

00:06:05.224 --> 00:06:06.631
the subject interesting.

00:06:07.511 --> 00:06:09.231
Whether that means it’s an interesting

00:06:09.231 --> 00:06:11.401
story about a period of history,

00:06:11.651 --> 00:06:13.881
about someone who lived a particularly

00:06:13.881 --> 00:06:16.721
interesting or important life, or about

00:06:16.761 --> 00:06:19.151
a particularly interesting concept,

00:06:19.431 --> 00:06:21.881
it needs to be interesting to me.

00:06:23.091 --> 00:06:25.741
Secondly, it shouldn’t be about current

00:06:25.741 --> 00:06:28.331
affairs or a topic that will become

00:06:28.411 --> 00:06:30.931
irrelevant in weeks or months to come.

00:06:31.684 --> 00:06:34.674
My hope is that anyone can go through

00:06:34.694 --> 00:06:37.744
our library of episodes and choose one

00:06:37.924 --> 00:06:39.454
that we might have made several years

00:06:39.454 --> 00:06:42.784
ago, but it will be just as relevant

00:06:42.794 --> 00:06:45.124
today as it was when it was made.

00:06:45.944 --> 00:06:48.504
So something like King Henry VIII

00:06:48.654 --> 00:06:51.244
or Cleopatra - realistically,

00:06:51.564 --> 00:06:53.384
that isn’t going to change much,

00:06:53.544 --> 00:06:55.771
so it makes for a good candidate.

00:06:57.088 --> 00:06:59.964
And thirdly, it shouldn’t be about a

00:06:59.974 --> 00:07:02.894
highly controversial or divisive topic.

00:07:03.694 --> 00:07:06.874
I try to be as apolitical as possible

00:07:06.934 --> 00:07:09.584
in this show, within reason, and

00:07:09.764 --> 00:07:11.464
there are some topics that I know

00:07:11.464 --> 00:07:14.064
with complete certainty would end up

00:07:14.074 --> 00:07:16.924
flooding my inbox with angry messages

00:07:17.104 --> 00:07:18.744
on both sides of the argument.

00:07:19.404 --> 00:07:20.944
I’m sure you can imagine what

00:07:20.944 --> 00:07:22.464
might fit into that category.

00:07:23.534 --> 00:07:25.354
There are a few other things I

00:07:25.384 --> 00:07:28.074
take into consideration too, like

00:07:28.304 --> 00:07:29.964
whether a story can be properly

00:07:29.964 --> 00:07:32.374
told in an audio-only format.

00:07:33.044 --> 00:07:35.624
Some, like if you are talking about

00:07:35.644 --> 00:07:38.294
works of art or geographical borders,

00:07:38.694 --> 00:07:41.464
just don’t work quite so well without

00:07:41.514 --> 00:07:43.924
images, so I’ll also take that into

00:07:43.924 --> 00:07:46.304
consideration, and that’s the reason

00:07:46.494 --> 00:07:48.364
there aren’t many episodes about art.

00:07:49.454 --> 00:07:52.274
We also now make one three-part

00:07:52.304 --> 00:07:54.104
mini-series every month.

00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:56.934
Sometimes these will be about three

00:07:57.228 --> 00:07:59.454
different subjects that are all on

00:07:59.454 --> 00:08:02.964
a similar theme, but sometimes there

00:08:02.964 --> 00:08:04.994
will be a story that I just don’t

00:08:05.004 --> 00:08:06.864
think can be properly told in a

00:08:06.874 --> 00:08:09.404
single 20-minute episode, like the

00:08:09.404 --> 00:08:11.554
one on the Cambridge Five spy ring.

00:08:12.434 --> 00:08:14.844
This started as a standalone,

00:08:15.134 --> 00:08:17.424
single episode, but I ended up

00:08:17.424 --> 00:08:19.364
splitting it into three different

00:08:19.364 --> 00:08:22.014
episodes, a three-part mini-series.

00:08:23.254 --> 00:08:27.114
So, once a topic is chosen, what next?

00:08:27.684 --> 00:08:31.044
Well, I’ll usually try to get as much of

00:08:31.044 --> 00:08:33.444
an understanding of the story or the topic

00:08:33.444 --> 00:08:36.094
as possible before writing anything down.

00:08:37.314 --> 00:08:39.764
This might start with something as basic

00:08:40.104 --> 00:08:42.774
as skimming over a Wikipedia entry to try

00:08:42.774 --> 00:08:45.204
to get an overview of the topic, before

00:08:45.404 --> 00:08:47.914
going into more detail about particular

00:08:47.944 --> 00:08:50.604
events or parts of the story, reading

00:08:50.614 --> 00:08:53.634
opinion pieces, downloading datasets and

00:08:53.834 --> 00:08:55.734
trying to make sense of them, reading

00:08:55.754 --> 00:08:57.964
books on the topic, it can be anything

00:08:58.224 --> 00:09:00.834
that helps me understand the topic better.

00:09:01.944 --> 00:09:04.504
Sometimes I start from a position of

00:09:04.544 --> 00:09:06.684
relative knowledge, if I’m writing

00:09:06.684 --> 00:09:08.604
about something I already know about.

00:09:09.294 --> 00:09:12.264
I started this show while living in Malta.

00:09:12.624 --> 00:09:15.494
I lived there for seven years and made

00:09:15.494 --> 00:09:18.134
several episodes about things related

00:09:18.184 --> 00:09:21.314
to Malta, so I was able to write most of

00:09:21.344 --> 00:09:23.994
those without too much prior research.

00:09:24.784 --> 00:09:27.054
And I’ll often make episodes about

00:09:27.064 --> 00:09:29.824
people or historical events I’m already

00:09:29.834 --> 00:09:32.234
reading about, so I’ll be reading a

00:09:32.244 --> 00:09:35.484
book for fun, taking notes, and then

00:09:35.704 --> 00:09:37.764
when it comes to writing the episode

00:09:37.764 --> 00:09:39.504
of English Learning for Curious Minds,

00:09:39.874 --> 00:09:42.424
I just refer back to my notes, and

00:09:42.674 --> 00:09:44.734
the process is a whole lot simpler.

00:09:45.904 --> 00:09:48.844
Once I feel relatively comfortable with

00:09:48.844 --> 00:09:50.914
my own knowledge of the subject, I’ll

00:09:50.914 --> 00:09:53.624
make a rough plan and start writing.

00:09:54.574 --> 00:09:57.234
A rough plan for me is a very simple

00:09:57.234 --> 00:09:59.754
collection of five or so bullet

00:09:59.754 --> 00:10:02.924
points, with general ideas of how

00:10:02.924 --> 00:10:04.534
I want the episode to develop.

00:10:05.334 --> 00:10:08.484
Sometimes it’s easy, like if it’s about

00:10:08.504 --> 00:10:10.754
the story of someone’s life, which

00:10:11.014 --> 00:10:13.294
typically follows a chronological order,

00:10:13.714 --> 00:10:17.184
but sometimes it’s harder, and it takes a

00:10:17.184 --> 00:10:19.794
bit more time and thought to get it right.

00:10:20.914 --> 00:10:22.754
Then, I start writing.

00:10:23.784 --> 00:10:26.074
When I first started, I would write

00:10:26.104 --> 00:10:28.804
out general bullet points rather than

00:10:28.814 --> 00:10:31.974
the entire script, but when it came

00:10:31.974 --> 00:10:34.534
to recording, I found this meant I

00:10:34.534 --> 00:10:37.894
spent more time pausing and repeating

00:10:37.894 --> 00:10:40.414
certain parts in a different way, so

00:10:40.724 --> 00:10:43.574
now I write out the entire script,

00:10:43.954 --> 00:10:46.274
and I simply read it out loud.

00:10:46.964 --> 00:10:50.184
But I write as I speak, or at least I

00:10:50.204 --> 00:10:53.994
try to, so my hope is for an episode

00:10:54.004 --> 00:10:55.914
to sound more like a conversation,

00:10:56.054 --> 00:10:58.494
more like natural speech, than a

00:10:58.504 --> 00:11:01.294
formal written article read aloud.

00:11:02.464 --> 00:11:05.384
As you can probably tell, I use a range

00:11:05.394 --> 00:11:08.114
of different vocabulary and expressions.

00:11:08.864 --> 00:11:11.204
There is no particular grand science

00:11:11.204 --> 00:11:14.614
to this, but I try to use language that

00:11:14.614 --> 00:11:18.154
someone at a B1 level could understand

00:11:18.284 --> 00:11:20.604
at a bit of a stretch, language that

00:11:20.614 --> 00:11:23.234
someone at a C1 level could understand

00:11:23.364 --> 00:11:26.164
almost entirely, but that anyone

00:11:26.534 --> 00:11:29.994
at B1 to C1 level will learn from.

00:11:31.464 --> 00:11:35.071
This means not artificially dumbing down

00:11:35.071 --> 00:11:39.414
my language or using simple terms, but I

00:11:39.414 --> 00:11:42.654
might say something twice in two different

00:11:42.654 --> 00:11:46.314
ways — first naturally, and then in

00:11:46.314 --> 00:11:48.944
another, simpler way that will help you

00:11:48.984 --> 00:11:51.524
understand if you didn’t the first time.

00:11:52.934 --> 00:11:55.504
I speak more clearly than I would if

00:11:55.504 --> 00:11:57.154
I were speaking to a native speaker,

00:11:57.724 --> 00:11:59.614
and of course, I make sure that

00:11:59.634 --> 00:12:01.424
all of the more complicated words

00:12:01.424 --> 00:12:03.874
and phrases are clearly defined in

00:12:03.874 --> 00:12:06.044
our transcripts and study packs.

00:12:06.994 --> 00:12:09.694
There are around 100 of these advanced

00:12:09.694 --> 00:12:12.834
words and phrases per episode, so that’s

00:12:12.834 --> 00:12:15.924
more than 50,000 different definitions

00:12:15.924 --> 00:12:18.594
created, and when you remove the

00:12:18.604 --> 00:12:21.154
duplicates, the ones that have appeared

00:12:21.224 --> 00:12:23.234
twice or more, there’s something like

00:12:23.334 --> 00:12:27.354
20,000 B2 and above words that you’d

00:12:27.354 --> 00:12:29.254
learn if you listened to every episode.

00:12:29.754 --> 00:12:33.054
Now, in terms of length, I aim to

00:12:33.054 --> 00:12:35.764
make each episode around 20 minutes

00:12:35.774 --> 00:12:38.514
long, with some coming in slightly

00:12:38.594 --> 00:12:41.004
under that and others a little over,

00:12:41.424 --> 00:12:43.794
which means the script should be

00:12:43.974 --> 00:12:47.824
between 2,500 and 3,000 words long.

00:12:49.184 --> 00:12:52.054
I try to write the script in one go,

00:12:52.554 --> 00:12:55.894
and this writing process typically

00:12:56.134 --> 00:12:59.294
takes anywhere from two to five hours.

00:12:59.674 --> 00:13:02.474
It’s rarely less than two, sometimes it

00:13:02.474 --> 00:13:05.594
can be much more than 5, but it tends to

00:13:05.594 --> 00:13:08.861
fall into that two-to-five-hour bracket.

00:13:09.784 --> 00:13:11.834
Now, you might think this is quick,

00:13:12.214 --> 00:13:13.834
or you might think it’s a long

00:13:13.834 --> 00:13:16.224
time, but all I’ll say is that

00:13:16.224 --> 00:13:18.264
it used to take me a lot longer.

00:13:19.054 --> 00:13:22.784
After doing it 565 times and writing

00:13:22.794 --> 00:13:25.334
well over a million words, I've had

00:13:25.424 --> 00:13:27.744
quite a lot of practice, so it would

00:13:27.744 --> 00:13:29.834
be strange if I hadn’t got quicker.

00:13:31.044 --> 00:13:33.194
And this brings me on to

00:13:33.194 --> 00:13:34.664
another important point.

00:13:35.194 --> 00:13:36.984
At various points over the

00:13:36.984 --> 00:13:39.184
years, I have tried a bunch of

00:13:39.184 --> 00:13:41.654
things to speed up the process.

00:13:42.284 --> 00:13:45.064
I've experimented with hiring external

00:13:45.074 --> 00:13:47.694
scriptwriters to write episodes of

00:13:47.714 --> 00:13:49.404
English Learning for Curious Minds.

00:13:49.924 --> 00:13:51.924
I posted a job for this once and

00:13:51.924 --> 00:13:54.394
got more than 500 applicants,

00:13:54.594 --> 00:13:57.194
and I trialled 30 different ones.

00:13:58.434 --> 00:14:01.244
Unfortunately–or perhaps fortunately–I

00:14:01.244 --> 00:14:03.214
never managed to find someone who was

00:14:03.224 --> 00:14:05.934
able to write to a level of quality

00:14:05.934 --> 00:14:08.154
that I was happy with, and that I

00:14:08.154 --> 00:14:11.234
felt was true to my voice and style,

00:14:11.294 --> 00:14:13.684
the voice and style of this podcast.

00:14:14.394 --> 00:14:17.614
In every case, when I would review the

00:14:17.614 --> 00:14:19.874
script that they had written, I found

00:14:19.874 --> 00:14:22.894
myself making so many edits and changes

00:14:23.184 --> 00:14:26.184
to their drafts, and starting to record an

00:14:26.184 --> 00:14:28.704
episode and realising that something they

00:14:28.704 --> 00:14:31.754
had written didn’t sound like me, that I

00:14:31.754 --> 00:14:33.724
realised it would have been quicker for

00:14:33.734 --> 00:14:36.424
me to just write everything from scratch.

00:14:37.064 --> 00:14:40.474
So that is now what I do: no external

00:14:40.474 --> 00:14:42.664
scriptwriters, everything on this

00:14:42.664 --> 00:14:45.484
show is written by me, Alastair.

00:14:46.364 --> 00:14:48.764
I do, however, have another

00:14:48.814 --> 00:14:50.824
scriptwriting colleague, in the

00:14:50.834 --> 00:14:53.544
form of various AI models I use

00:14:53.544 --> 00:14:55.594
to help me at different points in

00:14:55.594 --> 00:14:57.394
the planning and writing process.

00:14:58.014 --> 00:15:01.424
Specifically, I primarily use ChatGPT,

00:15:01.654 --> 00:15:04.484
Claude and Grok, but I’ll sometimes

00:15:04.484 --> 00:15:07.354
use other tools as well for a second

00:15:07.354 --> 00:15:09.034
or third opinion on something.

00:15:09.824 --> 00:15:12.064
During the planning stage, I will

00:15:12.064 --> 00:15:15.244
often tell ChatGPT what my proposed

00:15:15.294 --> 00:15:17.724
outline is, and ask it to point

00:15:17.824 --> 00:15:19.804
out areas I hadn’t thought about.

00:15:20.454 --> 00:15:23.144
If I get writer’s block, and I’m just

00:15:23.154 --> 00:15:25.994
not sure where to go next in a script,

00:15:26.474 --> 00:15:28.264
I might paste in what I’ve written

00:15:28.675 --> 00:15:31.254
thus far and ask it to give me three

00:15:31.254 --> 00:15:33.194
different routes to take it next.

00:15:34.294 --> 00:15:37.534
I don’t always use what the AI suggests,

00:15:37.744 --> 00:15:40.684
and if I do use them, I often find

00:15:40.684 --> 00:15:43.174
myself having to rewrite much of

00:15:43.174 --> 00:15:46.324
what ChatGPT provided, but they can

00:15:46.324 --> 00:15:49.204
be useful for giving me a fresh idea

00:15:49.464 --> 00:15:51.724
and helping me get back on track.

00:15:52.934 --> 00:15:55.574
I have, by the way, tested multiple

00:15:55.574 --> 00:15:57.914
times trying to get ChatGPT to

00:15:57.924 --> 00:16:00.614
actually write episodes in my voice.

00:16:01.214 --> 00:16:03.094
It does a better job than most of the

00:16:03.094 --> 00:16:05.304
human scriptwriters I've previously

00:16:05.304 --> 00:16:07.964
worked with, but it still sounds far

00:16:07.964 --> 00:16:11.874
too artificial, too unlike me, so

00:16:12.144 --> 00:16:14.644
I use it more as a sounding board,

00:16:15.294 --> 00:16:18.324
an editor and a review tool rather

00:16:18.324 --> 00:16:21.194
than a tool to write episode scripts.

00:16:22.084 --> 00:16:25.054
Now, when I've finished the draft of an

00:16:25.054 --> 00:16:28.094
episode, I’ll typically wait at least 24

00:16:28.124 --> 00:16:31.164
hours, preferably more like two or three

00:16:31.164 --> 00:16:34.194
days, and then I’ll return to the script.

00:16:34.724 --> 00:16:36.984
I’ll review it myself, spend a couple

00:16:36.984 --> 00:16:39.534
more hours making changes, and I’ll

00:16:39.574 --> 00:16:43.054
also paste the entire thing into two or

00:16:43.054 --> 00:16:45.579
three different AI tools and ask them

00:16:45.579 --> 00:16:48.084
to do everything from fact-checking

00:16:48.114 --> 00:16:50.384
to grammar checking, and to give

00:16:50.384 --> 00:16:52.514
me feedback on the narrative arc,

00:16:52.844 --> 00:16:54.764
things that I’ve missed, and so on.

00:16:55.534 --> 00:16:58.374
I don’t always act on the feedback,

00:16:58.624 --> 00:17:01.244
but it certainly is useful to have

00:17:01.244 --> 00:17:03.884
it there as a second or even third

00:17:03.884 --> 00:17:06.624
opinion, albeit a non-human one.

00:17:08.054 --> 00:17:09.914
And then, once I am happy

00:17:09.914 --> 00:17:11.714
with it, I’ll press record.

00:17:12.524 --> 00:17:15.644
I almost always find something I’m unhappy

00:17:15.644 --> 00:17:18.914
with during the recording process, so I

00:17:18.914 --> 00:17:21.344
have to stop the recording and rewrite

00:17:21.374 --> 00:17:23.414
that bit of the script before re-recording

00:17:23.414 --> 00:17:26.974
it, but once that is done, my work with

00:17:26.974 --> 00:17:29.864
the script is over, and it’s passed to

00:17:29.864 --> 00:17:32.284
our audio editor before being passed

00:17:32.294 --> 00:17:34.594
to our in-house teacher who creates

00:17:34.604 --> 00:17:36.484
all the in-line vocabulary definitions,

00:17:36.744 --> 00:17:38.564
and the accompanying study pack.

00:17:39.464 --> 00:17:42.954
And…that, I guess, is it.

00:17:44.094 --> 00:17:46.924
It isn’t a huge secret or special

00:17:46.924 --> 00:17:49.744
sauce, but rather the product of

00:17:49.744 --> 00:17:52.454
doing something more than 500 times.

00:17:53.264 --> 00:17:56.104
Still, there are many times when I listen

00:17:56.104 --> 00:17:58.994
to something again and think “eugh, I

00:17:58.994 --> 00:18:00.184
should have said that in a different

00:18:00.184 --> 00:18:02.804
way, or it would have been interesting

00:18:02.804 --> 00:18:05.464
to have talked about x instead of y”.

00:18:06.434 --> 00:18:09.444
I try not to listen to the episodes

00:18:09.444 --> 00:18:12.074
again, because I know that if I did

00:18:12.074 --> 00:18:14.814
this, I’d be constantly worrying

00:18:14.814 --> 00:18:16.944
about going back to change certain

00:18:16.944 --> 00:18:19.474
things, and that would mean that there

00:18:19.474 --> 00:18:21.574
wasn’t any time for making new ones.

00:18:22.284 --> 00:18:25.334
And I also now don’t really look too much

00:18:25.554 --> 00:18:27.904
at how many people listened to certain

00:18:27.904 --> 00:18:30.054
episodes, especially not on YouTube.

00:18:31.084 --> 00:18:34.084
As you probably know, the algorithms on

00:18:34.114 --> 00:18:37.144
tools like YouTube and Spotify tend to

00:18:37.164 --> 00:18:41.224
gravitate towards clickbaity and extreme

00:18:41.274 --> 00:18:44.504
titles and subjects, so that’s why you see

00:18:44.504 --> 00:18:47.034
people making episodes about things like

00:18:47.438 --> 00:18:49.594
“10 English Words You Have To Know Today!”

00:18:49.854 --> 00:18:52.214
or “This Is Why You Can’t Speak English”.

00:18:52.934 --> 00:18:54.594
I know that I don’t want to make

00:18:54.604 --> 00:18:56.854
episodes about those sorts of things,

00:18:57.084 --> 00:18:59.634
and if I did, it would attract the

00:18:59.634 --> 00:19:01.274
wrong types of people to the show.

00:19:02.234 --> 00:19:05.434
What’s more, I often receive emails from

00:19:05.434 --> 00:19:07.804
people telling me how much they enjoyed

00:19:07.824 --> 00:19:10.264
episodes that didn’t do nearly as well

00:19:10.304 --> 00:19:13.634
in terms of downloads, so I now pay very

00:19:13.634 --> 00:19:16.014
little attention to the download numbers.

00:19:16.764 --> 00:19:18.334
What I do pay attention to,

00:19:18.754 --> 00:19:21.604
however, is what you, the wonderful

00:19:21.614 --> 00:19:23.784
listeners of this show and members

00:19:23.804 --> 00:19:25.594
of Leonardo English, tell me.

00:19:25.964 --> 00:19:29.204
So let me finish this slightly meta

00:19:29.234 --> 00:19:31.694
episode by sharing some interesting

00:19:31.694 --> 00:19:34.204
facts from this big survey that

00:19:34.204 --> 00:19:35.904
hundreds of you were so kind

00:19:35.904 --> 00:19:37.684
to fill out at the end of July.

00:19:38.574 --> 00:19:40.764
So, the most popular countries

00:19:40.944 --> 00:19:43.674
in terms of listeners are Spain,

00:19:44.034 --> 00:19:46.554
China, Brazil, Italy and Germany.

00:19:47.554 --> 00:19:51.108
Most listeners are over the age of 35.

00:19:51.598 --> 00:19:55.394
69% of you say you listen for pleasure,

00:19:55.814 --> 00:19:59.744
while 47% list work as a reason.

00:20:00.874 --> 00:20:04.814
75% of you also read books in English, and

00:20:05.064 --> 00:20:09.334
66% of you watch TV or films in English.

00:20:09.884 --> 00:20:12.254
Only 12% of you go to an

00:20:12.284 --> 00:20:13.624
English-language school.

00:20:14.536 --> 00:20:17.794
71% of you listen to other English

00:20:17.804 --> 00:20:21.414
podcasts–well done–and 65% of

00:20:21.414 --> 00:20:23.914
you say your biggest challenge is

00:20:23.944 --> 00:20:26.323
speaking fluently, no surprise there.

00:20:27.164 --> 00:20:29.134
I asked for feedback on how

00:20:29.134 --> 00:20:30.624
we could improve the show.

00:20:31.174 --> 00:20:33.594
There were some wonderful suggestions, but

00:20:33.934 --> 00:20:37.524
quite a few examples of the wide variety

00:20:37.524 --> 00:20:39.684
of people who listen to this podcast,

00:20:39.864 --> 00:20:41.924
and how you can’t please everyone.

00:20:42.914 --> 00:20:45.194
A bunch of you said you wanted more

00:20:45.224 --> 00:20:47.584
episodes about British society and

00:20:47.584 --> 00:20:49.934
culture, and about the same number

00:20:49.934 --> 00:20:51.834
of you said you wanted fewer.

00:20:52.564 --> 00:20:55.074
Almost as many of you said you wanted

00:20:55.114 --> 00:20:57.434
shorter episodes as said you wanted

00:20:57.444 --> 00:21:00.364
longer episodes, and there were as many

00:21:00.364 --> 00:21:02.604
of you who requested more complicated

00:21:02.604 --> 00:21:05.084
vocabulary as those of you who said

00:21:05.084 --> 00:21:06.894
you found it too hard to understand.

00:21:07.544 --> 00:21:10.694
We will, most probably, introduce some

00:21:10.704 --> 00:21:13.234
shorter episodes, and there are lots of

00:21:13.234 --> 00:21:15.774
more specific pieces of feedback that I’ll

00:21:15.784 --> 00:21:18.284
definitely be incorporating into the show,

00:21:18.754 --> 00:21:21.764
but these are just a few examples of how

00:21:21.764 --> 00:21:24.724
you can’t please everyone, and sometimes

00:21:24.994 --> 00:21:27.464
how you have to just do what feels right…

00:21:28.504 --> 00:21:31.424
And very interestingly, of those of you

00:21:31.424 --> 00:21:35.194
who are members, 70% said you use your

00:21:35.194 --> 00:21:37.804
membership either every day or several

00:21:37.804 --> 00:21:40.494
times a week, which just goes to show that

00:21:40.494 --> 00:21:43.254
it really is very useful to many of you.

00:21:44.244 --> 00:21:47.434
So, there we go, a peek behind

00:21:47.444 --> 00:21:49.534
the curtain, a look inside

00:21:49.574 --> 00:21:51.194
how these episodes are made.

00:21:51.744 --> 00:21:54.494
I get pretty regular emails from people

00:21:54.534 --> 00:21:56.124
saying that they are thinking of starting

00:21:56.124 --> 00:21:58.894
a similar type of podcast in Spanish

00:21:58.894 --> 00:22:02.244
or French or Italian, and asking me

00:22:02.264 --> 00:22:04.754
for “the secret sauce” of how to do it.

00:22:05.494 --> 00:22:07.344
As you can see, there really

00:22:07.354 --> 00:22:09.464
isn’t a secret, but it’s the

00:22:09.464 --> 00:22:11.434
product of doing something pretty

00:22:11.434 --> 00:22:13.954
much every day for five years.

00:22:14.434 --> 00:22:15.764
If you are thinking of starting

00:22:15.764 --> 00:22:17.604
a podcast like this in your own

00:22:17.624 --> 00:22:19.664
language — whether it’s Spanish,

00:22:19.714 --> 00:22:22.414
French, Chinese, whatever — my biggest

00:22:22.424 --> 00:22:24.574
piece of advice is just to start.

00:22:25.254 --> 00:22:26.474
Don’t worry if the first

00:22:26.474 --> 00:22:27.744
episodes aren’t perfect.

00:22:28.154 --> 00:22:30.574
As you now know, mine certainly weren’t.

00:22:31.274 --> 00:22:34.504
And as a final thought, thank you

00:22:34.694 --> 00:22:36.944
for listening, and an especially

00:22:36.944 --> 00:22:38.679
big thank you to those of you who

00:22:38.679 --> 00:22:40.594
are members or who have ever bought

00:22:40.644 --> 00:22:42.574
a course or one of our products.

00:22:42.954 --> 00:22:44.994
This show literally wouldn’t

00:22:44.994 --> 00:22:46.304
be possible without you.

00:22:47.714 --> 00:22:50.234
OK then, that’s it for this meta

00:22:50.234 --> 00:22:53.324
episode on how I make podcast episodes.

00:22:53.524 --> 00:22:54.744
I hope it was an interesting one,

00:22:55.074 --> 00:22:56.344
that you learned something new,

00:22:56.714 --> 00:22:58.654
and don’t worry, regular service

00:22:58.684 --> 00:23:00.604
will resume from the next episode.

00:23:00.924 --> 00:23:02.834
You've been listening to English Learning

00:23:02.834 --> 00:23:05.464
for Curious Minds by Leonardo English.

00:23:05.874 --> 00:23:08.794
I'm Alastair Budge, you stay safe, and

00:23:08.794 --> 00:23:11.254
I'll catch you in the next episode.
