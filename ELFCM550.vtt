Hello, hello, hello, and welcome

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:09.860
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.660
Minds, by Leonardo English, the show

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:14.439
where you can listen to fascinating

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.900
stories and learn weird and wonderful

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:18.950
things about the world at the same

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:20.959
time as improving your English.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.970
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.450
the start of another three-part

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.030
mini-series, this time on modern Egypt.

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.460
In part one, this episode, we are going to

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.760
be talking about The Egyptian Revolution.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.030
In part two, the next episode, we are

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.500
going to be looking at the huge new

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.070
city Egypt is trying to build in the

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.379
desert, and ask ourselves whether it is a

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:49.669
much-needed modernisation of the country,

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.449
or a sign of something more sinister.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.219
And in part three, we are going to

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:58.160
talk about the case of Giulio Regeni,

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.860
the Italian PhD student who was

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.210
abducted from the streets of Cairo,

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.699
tortured and brutally murdered, almost

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.120
certainly by the Egyptian police.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.059
OK then, let’s get right into it and

00:01:13.099 --> 00:01:15.539
talk about the Egyptian Revolution.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.179
With the benefit of hindsight,

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.820
most revolutions look obvious.

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:25.229
Whether it is an autocratic leader, an

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:28.190
unsympathetic elite, widespread famine,

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:31.039
police brutality, systemic corruption,

00:01:31.309 --> 00:01:33.728
high unemployment, runaway inflation,

00:01:34.078 --> 00:01:36.608
the lack of political freedom or some

00:01:36.658 --> 00:01:39.868
combination of any or all of these, it’s

00:01:39.948 --> 00:01:43.078
easy for historians to look back and say,

00:01:43.468 --> 00:01:45.988
“the conditions were ripe for revolution”.

00:01:47.558 --> 00:01:51.438
Egypt in 2011 would have had a tick in the

00:01:51.438 --> 00:01:54.428
box for practically all of those things.

00:01:55.078 --> 00:01:57.948
High unemployment, inflation, police

00:01:57.948 --> 00:02:00.478
brutality, lack of civic freedoms,

00:02:00.668 --> 00:02:03.698
corruption, and of course an autocratic

00:02:03.728 --> 00:02:06.238
leader in the form of Hosni Mubarak.

00:02:06.968 --> 00:02:09.628
But Egypt had had all of these,

00:02:09.798 --> 00:02:12.758
including Mubarak, for three decades.

00:02:13.148 --> 00:02:15.438
The majority of living Egyptians

00:02:15.708 --> 00:02:17.178
had known nothing else.

00:02:17.948 --> 00:02:21.726
On the 6th of October, 1981, Egypt’s

00:02:21.726 --> 00:02:24.528
third president, Anwar Sadat, was

00:02:24.558 --> 00:02:27.195
assassinated during a military parade.

00:02:27.748 --> 00:02:30.448
His assassins were Islamists who did

00:02:30.448 --> 00:02:32.558
not agree with Egypt’s increasingly

00:02:32.558 --> 00:02:35.848
close relationship with Israel and held

00:02:36.068 --> 00:02:38.368
President Sadat wholly responsible.

00:02:39.488 --> 00:02:42.538
With Sadat dead, blown up by grenades,

00:02:42.738 --> 00:02:45.858
his vice-president, the then 53-year-old

00:02:45.993 --> 00:02:48.778
Hosni Mubarak, was sworn in eight

00:02:48.808 --> 00:02:51.388
days later, becoming president of the

00:02:51.388 --> 00:02:53.528
Middle East’s most populous country.

00:02:54.558 --> 00:02:57.115
Mubarak used the threat of Islamic

00:02:57.115 --> 00:02:59.455
extremism to continue the country’s

00:02:59.635 --> 00:03:02.045
“state of emergency”, which gave the

00:03:02.045 --> 00:03:04.535
state heightened powers to arrest,

00:03:04.895 --> 00:03:07.645
detain, and question if there was even

00:03:07.645 --> 00:03:11.165
the tiniest inkling of wrongdoing, and

00:03:11.535 --> 00:03:13.985
in many cases, even if there wasn’t.

00:03:14.825 --> 00:03:17.265
Protests were banned, political

00:03:17.265 --> 00:03:19.975
opponents were jailed, and the secret

00:03:19.975 --> 00:03:22.936
police kept a watchful eye on anyone

00:03:23.096 --> 00:03:25.306
who dared to whisper a complaint.

00:03:26.346 --> 00:03:29.586
For three decades, Mubarak ruled

00:03:29.626 --> 00:03:31.716
the country with an iron fist,

00:03:32.136 --> 00:03:34.116
using the military and security

00:03:34.116 --> 00:03:37.136
forces to suppress opposition and

00:03:37.156 --> 00:03:39.546
maintain control over the population.

00:03:41.006 --> 00:03:43.996
To the outside world, Mubarak sold

00:03:43.996 --> 00:03:47.886
himself as a steady hand, a stable and

00:03:47.886 --> 00:03:50.236
strong leader in a volatile region.

00:03:51.166 --> 00:03:52.976
Better a friendly dictator

00:03:53.146 --> 00:03:55.596
than, well, the unknown.

00:03:56.886 --> 00:03:59.636
And for a while, it worked.

00:04:00.486 --> 00:04:02.916
The West, especially the United States,

00:04:03.366 --> 00:04:05.876
propped him up with billions in aid,

00:04:06.226 --> 00:04:08.646
happy to have a reliable ally who

00:04:08.646 --> 00:04:11.006
kept the peace with Israel and the

00:04:11.016 --> 00:04:13.326
oil flowing through the Suez Canal.

00:04:14.426 --> 00:04:17.966
For Mubarak and his cronies, his family

00:04:18.146 --> 00:04:21.436
and his allies, life was good, very good.

00:04:22.316 --> 00:04:24.306
One estimate put his wealth

00:04:24.556 --> 00:04:27.351
at as much as $70 billion.

00:04:28.416 --> 00:04:31.326
On the President’s official salary of

00:04:31.516 --> 00:04:34.176
$70,000 a year, it would have taken him

00:04:34.226 --> 00:04:36.756
a million years to save that much money,

00:04:37.066 --> 00:04:40.446
but perhaps he was just a canny investor.

00:04:41.306 --> 00:04:41.656
No.

00:04:42.036 --> 00:04:45.226
He was egregiously corrupt, and he and

00:04:45.236 --> 00:04:48.166
his allies siphoned off huge amounts

00:04:48.166 --> 00:04:50.366
of the country’s wealth and stashed it

00:04:50.606 --> 00:04:53.166
in Swiss banks and foreign property.

00:04:54.466 --> 00:04:56.446
Of course, this was at the

00:04:56.446 --> 00:04:58.656
expense of the average Egyptian.

00:04:59.416 --> 00:05:01.666
Like in any highly-corrupt regime,

00:05:02.166 --> 00:05:04.416
the loss isn’t just the direct

00:05:04.446 --> 00:05:06.376
loss of money flowing out of the

00:05:06.376 --> 00:05:08.536
country to off-shore bank accounts.

00:05:08.856 --> 00:05:10.686
It’s the fact that business is

00:05:10.686 --> 00:05:12.766
harder, foreign companies don't

00:05:12.766 --> 00:05:14.980
want to invest in the country; the

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.400
corruption drags everything down.

00:05:18.864 --> 00:05:21.664
And beneath this international

00:05:21.854 --> 00:05:23.894
façade of stability, the

00:05:23.894 --> 00:05:25.924
Egyptian people were suffocating.

00:05:26.984 --> 00:05:30.264
In 2011, nearly 40% of the

00:05:30.264 --> 00:05:32.764
population still lived below

00:05:32.804 --> 00:05:34.744
the poverty line, scraping by

00:05:34.867 --> 00:05:36.877
on less than two dollars a day.

00:05:37.927 --> 00:05:40.067
Young people, who made up a huge

00:05:40.077 --> 00:05:42.577
chunk of Egypt’s 100 million-strong

00:05:42.577 --> 00:05:45.617
population, faced a grim future.

00:05:46.307 --> 00:05:48.927
University graduates, full of hope,

00:05:49.287 --> 00:05:51.917
ambition, and qualifications, found

00:05:51.917 --> 00:05:54.617
themselves driving taxis or selling

00:05:54.627 --> 00:05:56.937
fruit on street corners because

00:05:57.217 --> 00:05:58.897
there simply weren’t enough jobs.

00:06:00.057 --> 00:06:02.527
Inflation was eating away at

00:06:02.527 --> 00:06:03.967
what little money people had.

00:06:04.647 --> 00:06:07.627
Bread, a staple of the Egyptian diet,

00:06:07.967 --> 00:06:10.277
became a luxury for some families.

00:06:11.427 --> 00:06:14.107
And if you dared to speak out about it?

00:06:14.807 --> 00:06:16.757
Well, the police were more than

00:06:16.757 --> 00:06:18.707
happy to remind you who was in

00:06:18.707 --> 00:06:22.297
charge, often with a baton or worse.

00:06:23.767 --> 00:06:26.077
The tipping point, or at least what

00:06:26.087 --> 00:06:28.767
most commentators see as the first

00:06:28.817 --> 00:06:33.807
domino to fall, came in late 2010, 2,000

00:06:33.807 --> 00:06:36.387
kilometres to the West, in Tunisia.

00:06:37.727 --> 00:06:40.027
A 26-year-old street vendor

00:06:40.397 --> 00:06:42.909
called Mohamed Bouazizi had been a

00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:45.329
regular target for Tunisian police.

00:06:46.109 --> 00:06:48.349
He was frequently hassled and

00:06:48.359 --> 00:06:50.889
shaken down for bribes, forced

00:06:51.039 --> 00:06:52.529
to pay money to the police.

00:06:53.979 --> 00:06:56.799
On December 17th, 2010, the

00:06:56.799 --> 00:06:59.049
police came up to him again.

00:07:00.402 --> 00:07:03.312
It’s not clear exactly what happened,

00:07:03.512 --> 00:07:05.932
and there are varying accounts,

00:07:06.212 --> 00:07:08.752
but most reports suggest that

00:07:08.762 --> 00:07:11.042
the police knocked over his fruit

00:07:11.082 --> 00:07:13.952
cart and took his weighing scales.

00:07:15.102 --> 00:07:17.912
With no way to make money and still

00:07:17.922 --> 00:07:19.952
needing to pay his supplier for the

00:07:19.962 --> 00:07:21.572
produce that he was planning on selling

00:07:21.572 --> 00:07:24.632
that day, he went to the local governor’s

00:07:24.632 --> 00:07:27.692
office to explain what happened and

00:07:27.862 --> 00:07:29.982
demand the return of his scales.

00:07:31.042 --> 00:07:32.962
He had borrowed money to pay for

00:07:32.962 --> 00:07:35.152
the goods, and now the police had

00:07:35.152 --> 00:07:37.655
destroyed his only way of earning

00:07:37.685 --> 00:07:40.015
enough to pay back his debt.

00:07:41.175 --> 00:07:42.945
The governor wouldn’t listen.

00:07:44.085 --> 00:07:46.325
Bouazizi then went to a petrol

00:07:46.325 --> 00:07:49.965
station, bought a can of petrol, and

00:07:49.965 --> 00:07:51.985
returned to the governor’s office.

00:07:53.265 --> 00:07:56.275
He stood outside in the street, lifted

00:07:56.455 --> 00:07:59.095
the petrol can up above his head,

00:07:59.455 --> 00:08:02.125
emptied it all over himself, shouting,

00:08:02.565 --> 00:08:04.395
“How do you expect me to live?”

00:08:06.025 --> 00:08:07.545
He then lit a match,

00:08:07.884 --> 00:08:10.475
engulfing his body in flames.

00:08:11.805 --> 00:08:14.635
Watchers-on rushed to him and

00:08:14.635 --> 00:08:16.245
were able to put out the flames.

00:08:16.765 --> 00:08:19.466
He was rushed to hospital, but he

00:08:19.466 --> 00:08:22.956
didn’t make it; he died 18 days later.

00:08:24.696 --> 00:08:26.836
The story of Mohamed Bouazizi

00:08:27.146 --> 00:08:29.076
spread like wildfire.

00:08:30.086 --> 00:08:32.226
Social media posts, videos,

00:08:32.298 --> 00:08:34.178
and news reports captured

00:08:34.178 --> 00:08:35.788
the attention of millions.

00:08:36.528 --> 00:08:39.688
In Tunisia, protests erupted almost

00:08:39.708 --> 00:08:42.748
immediately, and soon the streets were

00:08:42.748 --> 00:08:45.348
filled with people calling for change.

00:08:46.808 --> 00:08:49.868
Within a month, Tunisia’s president, Zine

00:08:49.928 --> 00:08:52.958
El Abidine Ben Ali, had fled the country.

00:08:53.718 --> 00:08:56.418
A dictator who had ruled for 23

00:08:56.418 --> 00:08:58.888
years, brought down by the power

00:08:58.918 --> 00:09:01.218
of a single act of defiance.

00:09:02.208 --> 00:09:05.088
And as the news spread, so

00:09:05.368 --> 00:09:07.388
did the spirit of protest.

00:09:08.598 --> 00:09:11.708
In Egypt, the frustration and anger

00:09:11.748 --> 00:09:13.758
that had been simmering for decades

00:09:14.028 --> 00:09:16.598
were finally ready to boil over.

00:09:17.543 --> 00:09:19.858
Bouzazi was just like millions of

00:09:19.898 --> 00:09:21.878
other young people all over the Arab

00:09:21.878 --> 00:09:24.358
world, struggling every day to make

00:09:24.398 --> 00:09:26.888
ends meet, with seemingly no way

00:09:26.948 --> 00:09:29.518
out of the situation, and at the

00:09:29.528 --> 00:09:32.358
mercy of a corrupt police state.

00:09:33.468 --> 00:09:35.358
Add to the fire social media

00:09:35.738 --> 00:09:37.628
- Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube.

00:09:38.098 --> 00:09:40.298
These became powerful tools for

00:09:40.308 --> 00:09:42.588
mobilising protestors, bringing people

00:09:42.588 --> 00:09:44.858
together and sharing information.

00:09:46.008 --> 00:09:48.998
Facebook pages sprang up calling for

00:09:49.008 --> 00:09:51.898
demonstrations, and videos of the

00:09:51.898 --> 00:09:54.448
Tunisian protests were shared widely.

00:09:55.558 --> 00:09:57.638
One page in particular, named

00:09:57.938 --> 00:10:00.528
“We Are All Khaled Said,” became

00:10:00.528 --> 00:10:02.438
a focal point for activists.

00:10:03.098 --> 00:10:05.298
Khaled Said was a young Egyptian

00:10:05.308 --> 00:10:07.308
man who had been beaten to death

00:10:07.328 --> 00:10:10.048
by the police, and his story had

00:10:10.048 --> 00:10:12.028
sparked outrage across the country.

00:10:13.778 --> 00:10:17.708
Then came January the 25th, 2011.

00:10:18.908 --> 00:10:21.688
It’s National Police Day in Egypt, a

00:10:21.688 --> 00:10:23.618
day that commemorates the more than

00:10:23.618 --> 00:10:26.118
50 Egyptian police officers who were

00:10:26.178 --> 00:10:29.510
killed by the British army in 1952.

00:10:30.668 --> 00:10:33.898
In theory, it’s a day where the Egyptian

00:10:33.898 --> 00:10:36.928
people remember and honour the police.

00:10:37.208 --> 00:10:40.098
But this day in 2011 would be

00:10:40.108 --> 00:10:42.178
marked for a different reason.

00:10:42.968 --> 00:10:45.218
Through social media, people

00:10:45.248 --> 00:10:47.058
were encouraged to take to the

00:10:47.058 --> 00:10:49.888
streets not to support the police

00:10:50.228 --> 00:10:52.618
but to protest against them.

00:10:54.198 --> 00:10:56.798
This was very much a grassroots

00:10:56.808 --> 00:10:59.161
protest: people who organised

00:10:59.268 --> 00:11:01.528
Facebook pages, people encouraging

00:11:01.568 --> 00:11:03.548
others on Twitter, it was not led

00:11:03.818 --> 00:11:06.298
by any one individual or group.

00:11:07.218 --> 00:11:10.728
Still, people came out in their droves.

00:11:11.268 --> 00:11:14.048
Thousands of people gathered in Cairo,

00:11:14.476 --> 00:11:17.102
Alexandria, and cities across the country.

00:11:18.582 --> 00:11:21.452
Their demands, initially, were more about

00:11:21.502 --> 00:11:23.942
living conditions and social justice

00:11:24.062 --> 00:11:26.922
than anything else: the right to live a

00:11:26.922 --> 00:11:30.206
decent life, free from police harassment.

00:11:30.872 --> 00:11:33.702
It was about fairness, the ability for

00:11:33.702 --> 00:11:36.572
ordinary Egyptians to feed their family

00:11:36.862 --> 00:11:38.962
and live without the fear of being

00:11:38.982 --> 00:11:41.652
extorted or murdered by the police.

00:11:42.542 --> 00:11:44.212
They chanted for bread,

00:11:44.862 --> 00:11:46.802
freedom, and justice.

00:11:48.442 --> 00:11:50.732
At first, the government’s response

00:11:50.772 --> 00:11:53.612
was predictable – tear gas, rubber

00:11:53.612 --> 00:11:56.092
bullets, arrests, the textbook

00:11:56.112 --> 00:11:58.592
response of an authoritarian regime

00:11:58.782 --> 00:12:00.732
in the face of public protest.

00:12:01.572 --> 00:12:04.707
But unlike previous protests, the

00:12:04.707 --> 00:12:07.057
demonstrators didn’t disperse.

00:12:07.427 --> 00:12:08.727
They stood their ground,

00:12:09.107 --> 00:12:11.067
buoyed by the sense that this

00:12:11.067 --> 00:12:13.637
time, something was different.

00:12:15.037 --> 00:12:17.137
Tahrir Square, right in the

00:12:17.147 --> 00:12:19.077
heart of Cairo, became the

00:12:19.147 --> 00:12:21.077
epicentre of the uprising.

00:12:21.737 --> 00:12:24.147
Day and night, people occupied

00:12:24.147 --> 00:12:25.687
the square, camping out

00:12:25.887 --> 00:12:28.107
despite the threat of violence.

00:12:29.297 --> 00:12:31.677
Then, two days later,

00:12:32.007 --> 00:12:34.007
the country went dark.

00:12:34.707 --> 00:12:36.707
The largest internet service providers

00:12:36.927 --> 00:12:39.897
were turned off, as were telephone lines.

00:12:40.967 --> 00:12:44.007
Mubarak and his cronies had seen that this

00:12:44.007 --> 00:12:47.177
movement was being partially facilitated

00:12:47.417 --> 00:12:50.267
through social media - Facebook, Twitter

00:12:50.267 --> 00:12:52.827
and YouTube - and clearly thought that

00:12:52.837 --> 00:12:55.427
simply blocking this, switching it

00:12:55.427 --> 00:12:58.047
off, would bring about an end to it.

00:12:59.781 --> 00:13:02.917
It did not work and only served to

00:13:02.927 --> 00:13:05.367
light a greater fire in the belly

00:13:05.627 --> 00:13:07.287
of the Egyptians on the street.

00:13:08.397 --> 00:13:10.847
As the days went on, the protests

00:13:11.117 --> 00:13:13.767
only grew larger, with some outlets

00:13:13.927 --> 00:13:15.827
reporting that a million people

00:13:16.007 --> 00:13:17.827
had gathered in Tahrir Square.

00:13:19.017 --> 00:13:21.017
The government began to panic.

00:13:21.527 --> 00:13:24.397
Mubarak tried to placate the crowds

00:13:24.607 --> 00:13:26.967
by promising reforms and reshuffling

00:13:26.967 --> 00:13:29.697
his cabinet, but it wasn’t enough.

00:13:30.477 --> 00:13:33.817
The army was deployed, but in a twist,

00:13:34.157 --> 00:13:37.137
they refused to fire on the protestors.

00:13:38.587 --> 00:13:40.673
Soldiers and demonstrators

00:13:40.673 --> 00:13:43.617
mingled, and some soldiers even

00:13:43.627 --> 00:13:45.867
showed solidarity with the people.

00:13:46.987 --> 00:13:48.897
Mubarak’s position was becoming

00:13:48.917 --> 00:13:50.897
increasingly untenable.

00:13:51.697 --> 00:13:53.837
The United States, which had supported

00:13:53.837 --> 00:13:56.237
him for decades, was now calling

00:13:56.237 --> 00:13:58.947
for restraint and even reform.

00:14:00.497 --> 00:14:04.117
Finally, on February 11th, 2011,

00:14:04.427 --> 00:14:06.956
after 18 days of relentless

00:14:07.016 --> 00:14:09.696
protest, Mubarak stepped down.

00:14:10.906 --> 00:14:12.456
The announcement was made by

00:14:12.456 --> 00:14:14.146
his vice president, and the

00:14:14.166 --> 00:14:17.116
crowds erupted in jubilation.

00:14:17.926 --> 00:14:20.146
The crowds in Tahrir Square danced

00:14:20.286 --> 00:14:22.856
and cheered, the dictator was gone.

00:14:23.726 --> 00:14:25.816
The Egyptians had done it – they

00:14:25.816 --> 00:14:27.556
had overthrown a man who had

00:14:27.556 --> 00:14:29.816
ruled their country for 30 years.

00:14:30.706 --> 00:14:34.706
But the joy would prove to be short-lived.

00:14:35.376 --> 00:14:37.246
Toppling Mubarak was one thing;

00:14:37.676 --> 00:14:39.456
figuring out what came next

00:14:39.616 --> 00:14:41.506
was a whole different beast.

00:14:42.416 --> 00:14:44.866
For several months in the immediate

00:14:44.916 --> 00:14:47.326
aftermath, the military stepped in

00:14:47.326 --> 00:14:49.486
to run things, promising elections.

00:14:50.446 --> 00:14:52.716
Meanwhile, political groups that

00:14:52.716 --> 00:14:55.546
had been crushed under Mubarak, from

00:14:55.716 --> 00:14:58.046
secular activists to youth movements,

00:14:58.236 --> 00:15:00.576
trade unions to fledgling political

00:15:00.576 --> 00:15:03.166
parties, they all scrambled to

00:15:03.166 --> 00:15:05.856
organise, sensing their opportunity.

00:15:07.046 --> 00:15:09.696
But the problem was that Mubarak

00:15:09.786 --> 00:15:12.486
had spent decades rigging the game,

00:15:12.866 --> 00:15:14.906
leaving only token opposition.

00:15:16.686 --> 00:15:19.446
And the main opposition, or rather,

00:15:19.656 --> 00:15:21.816
the main apparent opposition,

00:15:22.106 --> 00:15:23.866
was the Muslim Brotherhood.

00:15:25.316 --> 00:15:27.206
This wasn’t exactly a

00:15:27.206 --> 00:15:28.796
new player on the scene.

00:15:29.306 --> 00:15:33.336
It was founded in 1928, and had grown

00:15:33.366 --> 00:15:36.666
into Egypt’s largest and best-organised

00:15:36.862 --> 00:15:39.206
Islamist movement, preaching social

00:15:39.206 --> 00:15:41.756
justice through a large network of

00:15:41.756 --> 00:15:44.446
charities, schools, and mosques.

00:15:45.336 --> 00:15:48.966
For years, Mubarak had banned it outright,

00:15:49.286 --> 00:15:51.816
jailing its leaders and branding it a

00:15:51.816 --> 00:15:54.996
threat, yet letting it linger in the

00:15:55.006 --> 00:15:58.186
background as something of a bogeyman.

00:15:59.596 --> 00:16:02.296
Mubarak had always framed it as a

00:16:02.316 --> 00:16:05.986
simple choice: me, the tough military

00:16:05.986 --> 00:16:08.616
man you know, or the Islamists.

00:16:09.686 --> 00:16:11.776
In other words, better the devil

00:16:11.786 --> 00:16:14.206
you know than the devil you don’t.

00:16:15.446 --> 00:16:18.276
Now, with Mubarak out of the picture,

00:16:18.716 --> 00:16:21.286
the Muslim Brotherhood saw its moment.

00:16:22.446 --> 00:16:24.146
It had a tremendous headstart.

00:16:24.959 --> 00:16:26.899
Unlike other political parties,

00:16:27.089 --> 00:16:28.979
it wasn’t starting from scratch.

00:16:29.489 --> 00:16:32.219
Its decades underground had built a

00:16:32.219 --> 00:16:34.749
machine no other group could match.

00:16:35.639 --> 00:16:38.439
While secularists and youth rallied

00:16:38.449 --> 00:16:40.989
in Tahrir Square with passion but

00:16:40.989 --> 00:16:43.079
little structure, the Brotherhood

00:16:43.399 --> 00:16:46.649
had members, money, and a plan.

00:16:48.099 --> 00:16:51.789
Still, initially, it lacked mass appeal.

00:16:53.019 --> 00:16:55.579
Egypt might be a Muslim-majority

00:16:55.619 --> 00:16:58.279
country, but that didn’t mean

00:16:58.489 --> 00:17:00.779
the majority of Egyptians wanted

00:17:00.789 --> 00:17:02.999
to be ruled by an Islamic group.

00:17:04.136 --> 00:17:07.419
To try to appeal to a broader population,

00:17:07.779 --> 00:17:11.309
the group softened its more radical edges,

00:17:11.599 --> 00:17:14.289
talking more about jobs and fairness than

00:17:14.289 --> 00:17:17.789
Sharia law, and launched a new political

00:17:17.789 --> 00:17:20.979
party, the Freedom and Justice Party.

00:17:22.159 --> 00:17:24.759
This wasn’t the Muslim Brotherhood, it was

00:17:24.759 --> 00:17:27.886
something new, refreshing, and idealistic.

00:17:29.006 --> 00:17:30.949
Not everyone bought it.

00:17:31.966 --> 00:17:35.036
To some, especially the urban middle

00:17:35.046 --> 00:17:37.676
class and Coptic Christians, it

00:17:37.676 --> 00:17:40.246
smelled like a power grab dressed

00:17:40.246 --> 00:17:43.586
up as reform; to others, people who

00:17:43.596 --> 00:17:45.256
had grown weary of corruption and

00:17:45.256 --> 00:17:48.566
poverty, it offered hope of a new dawn.

00:17:49.696 --> 00:17:53.816
Polls from late 2011 showed a mixed

00:17:53.836 --> 00:17:56.836
picture—about 30% of Egyptians backed

00:17:56.846 --> 00:17:59.506
them, far ahead of any rival, but

00:17:59.786 --> 00:18:02.796
trust was shaky, with many fearing an

00:18:02.879 --> 00:18:05.456
Islamist agenda was hidden behind the

00:18:05.466 --> 00:18:08.186
smiles and promises of prosperity.

00:18:09.566 --> 00:18:14.256
Then, in May of 2012, 14 months after

00:18:14.256 --> 00:18:17.316
the fall of Mubarak, Egypt held its

00:18:17.326 --> 00:18:20.076
first democratic presidential election.

00:18:21.356 --> 00:18:25.066
The Egyptian people faced a stark choice.

00:18:26.456 --> 00:18:29.026
On one side was Ahmed Shafik,

00:18:29.256 --> 00:18:31.686
a former Air Force officer and

00:18:31.819 --> 00:18:34.286
Mubarak’s last prime minister, who

00:18:34.286 --> 00:18:37.376
promised continuity and stability.

00:18:38.186 --> 00:18:40.476
A safe pair of hands, albeit

00:18:40.696 --> 00:18:42.786
not so different from those

00:18:42.786 --> 00:18:44.776
the people had just overthrown.

00:18:46.136 --> 00:18:49.266
On the other was Mohamed Morsi, a

00:18:49.266 --> 00:18:51.716
softly-spoken former engineering

00:18:51.716 --> 00:18:54.236
professor and the Brotherhood’s pick

00:18:54.516 --> 00:18:56.936
to lead its Freedom and Justice Party.

00:18:58.586 --> 00:19:02.366
It was close, but Morsi scraped it, with

00:19:02.386 --> 00:19:07.096
51.7% of the vote to Shafik’s 48.3%.

00:19:08.566 --> 00:19:11.836
Turnout was just over 50%, so

00:19:12.086 --> 00:19:14.116
Morsi won with the votes of around

00:19:14.336 --> 00:19:16.506
¼ of the country’s population.

00:19:17.496 --> 00:19:20.346
The Brotherhood had seized its chance.

00:19:21.186 --> 00:19:23.226
For the first time, Egypt

00:19:23.446 --> 00:19:25.216
had a democratically elected

00:19:25.216 --> 00:19:28.146
president, and Morsi promised a

00:19:28.146 --> 00:19:31.386
new era of openness and reform.

00:19:32.536 --> 00:19:36.236
But he’d inherited a country on its knees.

00:19:36.776 --> 00:19:38.956
Tourism was practically dead,

00:19:39.426 --> 00:19:42.496
foreign investors had bolted, and

00:19:42.556 --> 00:19:45.176
bread lines were sparking riots.

00:19:46.136 --> 00:19:48.836
Morsi, like many political leaders,

00:19:49.146 --> 00:19:51.516
found that governing the country was a

00:19:51.526 --> 00:19:53.686
lot harder than winning the election.

00:19:54.756 --> 00:19:57.316
The Muslim Brotherhood had spent decades

00:19:57.556 --> 00:20:00.206
as an underground movement, organising

00:20:00.246 --> 00:20:02.936
charity networks and building grassroots

00:20:02.946 --> 00:20:05.886
support, but it had precious little

00:20:05.886 --> 00:20:08.066
experience in the business of actually

00:20:08.336 --> 00:20:11.966
administering a country, and it showed.

00:20:13.336 --> 00:20:15.866
To make matters worse, the military

00:20:15.956 --> 00:20:17.906
wasn’t exactly thrilled to see

00:20:17.906 --> 00:20:19.716
an Islamist calling the shots.

00:20:20.496 --> 00:20:23.346
Yes, Mubarak was gone, but the

00:20:23.346 --> 00:20:25.262
police and the military were still

00:20:25.262 --> 00:20:28.156
just as powerful as before, and

00:20:28.386 --> 00:20:30.736
they were circling like vultures.

00:20:32.036 --> 00:20:35.996
Then, Morsi made a fatal miscalculation.

00:20:36.706 --> 00:20:37.836
He overreached.

00:20:39.046 --> 00:20:42.356
In November of 2012, he issued a

00:20:42.356 --> 00:20:45.366
decree giving himself near-absolute

00:20:45.436 --> 00:20:48.116
power, claiming it was temporary

00:20:48.246 --> 00:20:49.866
to protect the revolution from

00:20:49.866 --> 00:20:52.346
the judiciary, which he believed

00:20:52.456 --> 00:20:54.786
was still loyal to the old regime.

00:20:55.926 --> 00:20:58.116
Then came a new constitution,

00:20:58.436 --> 00:21:00.526
rushed through by his allies.

00:21:01.216 --> 00:21:03.826
Secular and Christian groups walked

00:21:03.826 --> 00:21:06.706
out, calling it an Islamist takeover,

00:21:07.266 --> 00:21:09.546
and when it passed in a referendum,

00:21:10.036 --> 00:21:12.796
barely a third of Egyptians voted.

00:21:14.222 --> 00:21:16.882
To many, Morsi wasn’t building

00:21:16.892 --> 00:21:18.982
a new Egypt, he was turning

00:21:18.982 --> 00:21:20.972
it into an Islamic state.

00:21:21.862 --> 00:21:24.112
Protests erupted once again,

00:21:24.182 --> 00:21:25.892
but this time, they were

00:21:25.902 --> 00:21:27.952
directed at the new president.

00:21:29.092 --> 00:21:32.022
The sense of unity that had characterised

00:21:32.032 --> 00:21:34.602
the anti-Mubarak protests was gone,

00:21:35.022 --> 00:21:38.002
replaced by deep political polarisation.

00:21:39.272 --> 00:21:43.552
All this optimism had, within 12 months

00:21:43.552 --> 00:21:46.152
really, given way to disappointment.

00:21:47.282 --> 00:21:49.822
And the army, which had craftily

00:21:49.842 --> 00:21:51.512
positioned itself as a kind

00:21:51.512 --> 00:21:54.592
of neutral protector, began

00:21:54.602 --> 00:21:56.632
to reassert its influence.

00:21:57.782 --> 00:22:00.682
By mid-2013, the discontent with

00:22:00.682 --> 00:22:02.712
Morsi had reached boiling point.

00:22:03.632 --> 00:22:05.162
Some polls pegged his

00:22:05.162 --> 00:22:08.052
approval rating as low as 30%.

00:22:08.342 --> 00:22:10.212
Millions took to the streets,

00:22:10.462 --> 00:22:12.012
demanding his resignation.

00:22:13.142 --> 00:22:15.902
But this wouldn’t prove to

00:22:15.902 --> 00:22:17.602
be a people’s revolution.

00:22:19.032 --> 00:22:21.092
The military saw their chance.

00:22:21.462 --> 00:22:24.702
On July 1st, they issued an ultimatum:

00:22:25.192 --> 00:22:29.742
sort this out in 48 hours, or we step in.

00:22:31.072 --> 00:22:33.862
Morsi dug his heels, insisting

00:22:33.992 --> 00:22:35.952
he was the legitimate president,

00:22:36.182 --> 00:22:38.172
elected by the people, which

00:22:38.172 --> 00:22:40.212
of course, technically he was.

00:22:41.202 --> 00:22:43.862
But legitimacy doesn’t mean much

00:22:44.002 --> 00:22:45.462
when the country’s against you

00:22:45.662 --> 00:22:47.992
and the army is itching to act.

00:22:49.346 --> 00:22:53.046
On July 3rd, 2013, General Abdel

00:22:53.046 --> 00:22:55.246
Fattah el-Sisi, the head of the

00:22:55.246 --> 00:22:57.946
armed forces, went on TV and

00:22:57.946 --> 00:23:00.446
announced that Morsi was out.

00:23:01.806 --> 00:23:04.126
Morsi, it seems, did not have

00:23:04.126 --> 00:23:05.486
much of a say in the matter.

00:23:06.396 --> 00:23:09.436
Tanks rolled into Cairo, President

00:23:09.436 --> 00:23:11.199
Morsi was arrested, and an

00:23:11.229 --> 00:23:13.159
interim government was set up.

00:23:14.529 --> 00:23:18.439
Sisi, this stern-faced military man with a

00:23:18.439 --> 00:23:21.259
knack for staying in the shadows, suddenly

00:23:21.429 --> 00:23:24.419
became the face of Egypt’s next chapter.

00:23:25.926 --> 00:23:29.606
To Morsi’s supporters, this was a coup,

00:23:29.936 --> 00:23:32.446
plain and simple: a betrayal of the

00:23:32.446 --> 00:23:34.136
democratic dream they’d fought for.

00:23:35.096 --> 00:23:36.566
The Muslim Brotherhood and its

00:23:36.576 --> 00:23:38.676
supporters organised sit-ins

00:23:38.866 --> 00:23:40.456
demanding Morsi’s return.

00:23:41.086 --> 00:23:45.096
For weeks, they held out, but on August

00:23:45.096 --> 00:23:49.546
14th, 2013, the military cracked down.

00:23:50.936 --> 00:23:53.786
What happened next was called by Human

00:23:53.786 --> 00:23:56.436
Rights Watch a crime against humanity.

00:23:57.906 --> 00:24:00.556
Security forces stormed the camps,

00:24:00.806 --> 00:24:03.306
firing live rounds into the crowds.

00:24:04.376 --> 00:24:06.866
It was one of the bloodiest days in

00:24:06.866 --> 00:24:09.826
modern Egyptian history, with some reports

00:24:10.106 --> 00:24:12.526
saying that more than a thousand peaceful

00:24:12.566 --> 00:24:14.996
protestors were killed by the army.

00:24:16.166 --> 00:24:18.606
The Brotherhood was outlawed again,

00:24:18.966 --> 00:24:21.326
its leaders jailed or executed,

00:24:22.006 --> 00:24:24.156
but Sisi didn’t stop there.

00:24:24.656 --> 00:24:27.749
Tens of thousands—activists, bloggers,

00:24:27.896 --> 00:24:30.536
even students—were rounded up in a

00:24:30.556 --> 00:24:33.296
sweeping crackdown that made Mubarak’s

00:24:33.296 --> 00:24:35.626
repression look mild by comparison.

00:24:36.973 --> 00:24:40.809
In 2014, Sisi ran for president, winning

00:24:40.819 --> 00:24:43.939
in a landslide against a token opponent.

00:24:45.399 --> 00:24:48.479
The world watched on with mixed feelings.

00:24:49.299 --> 00:24:51.786
The U.S., wary of losing an ally,

00:24:52.356 --> 00:24:55.226
avoided calling it a coup, while Gulf

00:24:55.236 --> 00:24:57.676
states like Saudi Arabia cheered,

00:24:58.036 --> 00:25:00.086
glad to see the Brotherhood crushed.

00:25:01.156 --> 00:25:04.916
Sisi had done it, and he has remained

00:25:04.946 --> 00:25:07.236
Egypt’s President to this very day.

00:25:08.136 --> 00:25:11.196
To his fans, he was a saviour, the

00:25:11.196 --> 00:25:14.136
strongman Egypt needed to stop the chaos.

00:25:15.146 --> 00:25:17.306
To his critics, he was Mubarak

00:25:17.396 --> 00:25:20.956
2.0: same military playbook, same

00:25:21.256 --> 00:25:24.426
authoritarian tendencies, just a new face.

00:25:25.356 --> 00:25:27.826
Protests were crushed, journalists

00:25:27.856 --> 00:25:30.186
locked up, and that “state of

00:25:30.186 --> 00:25:32.406
emergency” Mubarak loved so much?

00:25:33.036 --> 00:25:35.816
Sisi brought it back with a vengeance.

00:25:36.766 --> 00:25:38.946
The revolution’s dreams of bread,

00:25:39.356 --> 00:25:41.976
freedom, and social justice faded

00:25:41.976 --> 00:25:44.346
into the background as stability,

00:25:44.726 --> 00:25:46.876
however harsh, took centre stage.

00:25:48.146 --> 00:25:51.576
So, after Egypt’s rollercoaster ride from

00:25:51.736 --> 00:25:54.974
Mubarak to Morsi to Sisi, the country

00:25:55.124 --> 00:25:57.904
is stuck with another military dictator.

00:25:58.924 --> 00:26:01.104
Is he any better than the last one?

00:26:01.664 --> 00:26:03.954
Well, that’s a debate Egyptians

00:26:03.984 --> 00:26:05.894
are still wrestling with today.

00:26:08.054 --> 00:26:10.204
OK then, that is it for today's

00:26:10.204 --> 00:26:12.494
episode on the Egyptian Revolution.

00:26:12.934 --> 00:26:14.804
As a reminder, this was part

00:26:14.814 --> 00:26:17.114
one of a three-part mini-series

00:26:17.304 --> 00:26:19.354
on the theme of “modern Egypt”.

00:26:19.764 --> 00:26:22.414
Next up will be an episode on this bold

00:26:22.414 --> 00:26:24.834
new project to build a capital city in

00:26:24.834 --> 00:26:27.294
the Egyptian desert, and in part three,

00:26:27.624 --> 00:26:29.804
we will look at the gruesome but important

00:26:29.814 --> 00:26:32.814
case of the murder of Giulio Regeni.

00:26:33.464 --> 00:26:35.294
You've been listening to English Learning

00:26:35.294 --> 00:26:38.044
for Curious Minds by Leonardo English.

00:26:38.514 --> 00:26:41.464
I'm Alastair Budge, you stay safe, and

00:26:41.464 --> 00:26:43.994
I'll catch you in the next episode.
