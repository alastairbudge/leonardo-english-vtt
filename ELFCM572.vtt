Hello, hello, hello, and welcome

00:00:07.768 --> 00:00:09.798
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.798 --> 00:00:12.668
Minds, by Leonardo English, the show

00:00:12.678 --> 00:00:14.388
where you can listen to fascinating

00:00:14.388 --> 00:00:16.888
stories and learn weird and wonderful

00:00:16.898 --> 00:00:18.888
things about the world at the same

00:00:18.888 --> 00:00:20.708
time as improving your English.

00:00:21.168 --> 00:00:23.888
I'm Alastair Budge, and today it’s

00:00:23.898 --> 00:00:26.198
the start of another three-part

00:00:26.198 --> 00:00:28.558
mini-series, this time on

00:00:28.618 --> 00:00:30.868
“Tyrants Of The Roman Empire”.

00:00:31.198 --> 00:00:33.078
In today’s episode, we’re going

00:00:33.078 --> 00:00:34.678
to talk about the original

00:00:34.688 --> 00:00:37.038
Roman despot, the bloodthirsty,

00:00:37.238 --> 00:00:39.468
depraved, and ruthless Caligula.

00:00:40.208 --> 00:00:42.078
In part two, we’ll talk about

00:00:42.078 --> 00:00:43.648
one who wasn’t much better,

00:00:44.088 --> 00:00:45.688
the emperor who supposedly

00:00:45.868 --> 00:00:48.618
fiddled while Rome burned, Nero.

00:00:49.068 --> 00:00:50.528
And in part three, we’ll

00:00:50.528 --> 00:00:52.038
be looking at Commodus.

00:00:52.418 --> 00:00:54.158
He might have been the son of Marcus

00:00:54.198 --> 00:00:56.718
Aurelius, the “philosopher emperor”, but

00:00:57.058 --> 00:00:59.538
his exploits as emperor, from claiming

00:00:59.538 --> 00:01:02.008
to be Hercules reborn to fighting in the

00:01:02.008 --> 00:01:04.278
ring as a gladiator, were not something

00:01:04.288 --> 00:01:06.648
you’d find recommended in Meditations.

00:01:07.028 --> 00:01:10.088
OK then, let's not waste a minute and

00:01:10.098 --> 00:01:13.175
get right into the story of Caligula.

00:01:14.304 --> 00:01:15.758
Perhaps you can think of a

00:01:15.768 --> 00:01:17.918
dinner party you’ve been to where

00:01:17.928 --> 00:01:20.328
someone around the table burst

00:01:20.348 --> 00:01:22.578
out in uncontrollable laughter.

00:01:23.618 --> 00:01:26.458
Once they composed themselves, perhaps

00:01:26.468 --> 00:01:28.328
they revealed a joke they'd just

00:01:28.328 --> 00:01:30.978
been told, or a funny story they had

00:01:30.978 --> 00:01:33.148
just heard about someone they knew.

00:01:33.788 --> 00:01:36.618
Others most probably joined in

00:01:36.648 --> 00:01:38.768
the merriment, and the dinner

00:01:38.768 --> 00:01:40.798
party continued as usual.

00:01:41.838 --> 00:01:44.448
At one dinner party in ancient Rome,

00:01:44.898 --> 00:01:47.238
hosted by the then-emperor, Caligula,

00:01:47.798 --> 00:01:50.928
the host burst out in raucous laughter.

00:01:52.168 --> 00:01:53.928
Nobody seemed to have told the

00:01:53.928 --> 00:01:56.068
young emperor anything; nobody had

00:01:56.258 --> 00:01:58.688
slipped over on a stray grape or

00:01:58.908 --> 00:02:00.878
spilled the wine over someone’s head.

00:02:01.268 --> 00:02:02.388
There was no obvious

00:02:02.428 --> 00:02:04.378
cause for this outburst.

00:02:05.528 --> 00:02:08.018
His consuls, who were sitting next to

00:02:08.018 --> 00:02:11.158
him, asked him why he was laughing.

00:02:12.551 --> 00:02:15.561
He turned and said, "What do you

00:02:15.561 --> 00:02:18.301
suppose, except that at a single

00:02:18.301 --> 00:02:20.851
nod of mine, both of you could

00:02:20.861 --> 00:02:23.111
have your throats cut on the spot?"

00:02:24.371 --> 00:02:26.661
We have no historical record of

00:02:26.661 --> 00:02:29.081
what happened next, but presumably

00:02:29.441 --> 00:02:32.481
a gulp from one consul, perhaps an

00:02:32.481 --> 00:02:34.141
embarrassed laugh from the other.

00:02:34.661 --> 00:02:37.981
“Haha, good joke. It was a joke, right?”

00:02:39.291 --> 00:02:41.551
These two consuls, two of the

00:02:41.551 --> 00:02:43.641
highest elected officials of the

00:02:43.641 --> 00:02:45.741
Roman Empire, presumably knew

00:02:45.741 --> 00:02:48.061
that Caligula was deadly serious.

00:02:48.581 --> 00:02:51.301
A single wave of his hand or nod of his

00:02:51.301 --> 00:02:54.601
head and anyone in Rome, no matter how

00:02:54.611 --> 00:02:57.331
powerful, would be put to their death.

00:02:58.461 --> 00:03:00.671
This was a man who revelled in

00:03:00.691 --> 00:03:03.291
public humiliation, showed little

00:03:03.291 --> 00:03:06.511
regard for human life, and held his

00:03:06.551 --> 00:03:09.831
elected officials in utter disregard.

00:03:10.741 --> 00:03:13.531
But it was not always this way,

00:03:13.901 --> 00:03:15.881
or at least, if it was always his

00:03:16.011 --> 00:03:18.491
character, he kept it well hidden.

00:03:19.821 --> 00:03:22.141
To understand the tyranny of

00:03:22.171 --> 00:03:24.171
Caligula’s reign as emperor, we

00:03:24.171 --> 00:03:26.641
must go back to his birth, and

00:03:26.641 --> 00:03:28.751
indeed, we must remind ourselves

00:03:28.831 --> 00:03:30.831
of a little ancient Roman history.

00:03:32.041 --> 00:03:34.671
As you may know, or remember from

00:03:34.671 --> 00:03:36.941
our mini-series on ancient Rome three

00:03:36.941 --> 00:03:39.631
years ago, the politics and structure

00:03:39.831 --> 00:03:42.931
of ancient Rome can be broadly divided

00:03:43.171 --> 00:03:46.731
into two: the Republic and the Empire.

00:03:47.991 --> 00:03:50.211
The Republic officially ended in

00:03:50.271 --> 00:03:53.901
27 BC, and Rome became an empire,

00:03:54.171 --> 00:03:56.961
ruled by its first emperor, Augustus.

00:03:58.121 --> 00:04:00.808
Augustus was a much-loved emperor,

00:04:01.118 --> 00:04:03.311
but there was the problem of who

00:04:03.311 --> 00:04:05.641
would succeed him after his death.

00:04:06.191 --> 00:04:08.121
A problem, as you’ll see, that

00:04:08.121 --> 00:04:10.961
crops up again and again and again

00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:12.721
in the story of Ancient Rome.

00:04:14.001 --> 00:04:17.021
Augustus had no biological children,

00:04:17.491 --> 00:04:20.051
but there were several stepchildren

00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:21.831
and grandchildren knocking about,

00:04:22.321 --> 00:04:24.421
some more capable than others.

00:04:25.621 --> 00:04:28.761
After much manoeuvring, he named his

00:04:28.761 --> 00:04:32.221
stepson, Tiberius, as his heir on

00:04:32.221 --> 00:04:35.111
the condition that Tiberius adopt his

00:04:35.111 --> 00:04:37.861
nephew, Germanicus, as his own son,

00:04:38.281 --> 00:04:40.761
so the title of emperor would pass

00:04:40.831 --> 00:04:44.374
first to Tiberius, then to Germanicus.

00:04:45.841 --> 00:04:49.801
In AD 14, Augustus died, and

00:04:50.057 --> 00:04:52.411
Tiberius duly became emperor.

00:04:53.261 --> 00:04:55.091
Now, Tiberius was not

00:04:55.101 --> 00:04:56.871
exactly a people’s favourite.

00:04:57.191 --> 00:05:00.391
He was stern, often absent from Rome,

00:05:00.991 --> 00:05:03.441
and a man whose suspicious nature

00:05:03.681 --> 00:05:05.851
only deepened as he grew older.

00:05:06.691 --> 00:05:09.641
He was also sadistic and bloodthirsty,

00:05:09.951 --> 00:05:11.981
and could certainly have appeared in a

00:05:11.981 --> 00:05:14.121
mini-series on tyrants, were there not

00:05:14.201 --> 00:05:16.491
others who were even more tyrannical.

00:05:17.831 --> 00:05:20.341
Despite his relative unpopularity,

00:05:20.681 --> 00:05:23.571
his rule did provide some stability,

00:05:23.951 --> 00:05:25.831
and he would go on to rule from

00:05:25.861 --> 00:05:30.611
AD 13 to AD 37, 23 years in total.

00:05:31.221 --> 00:05:34.911
But with no direct heirs, all eyes

00:05:34.951 --> 00:05:38.301
turned, yet again, to the next generation.

00:05:39.321 --> 00:05:41.711
Here, there was a clear frontrunner:

00:05:42.021 --> 00:05:44.541
Germanicus, Tiberius’ adopted son,

00:05:45.231 --> 00:05:47.911
and by this point, a decorated young

00:05:47.911 --> 00:05:50.221
man and accomplished military leader.

00:05:51.101 --> 00:05:53.841
Germanicus was everything the Romans

00:05:53.841 --> 00:05:56.191
admired: a brilliant general, a

00:05:56.411 --> 00:05:59.311
charismatic leader, and — importantly

00:05:59.561 --> 00:06:01.771
— the great-nephew of Augustus

00:06:01.771 --> 00:06:04.461
himself, so he had that all-important

00:06:04.461 --> 00:06:07.931
pedigree, the blood tie to Augustus.

00:06:09.041 --> 00:06:10.691
What’s more, he was married

00:06:10.691 --> 00:06:12.671
to a granddaughter of

00:06:12.671 --> 00:06:14.671
Augustus, Agrippina the Elder.

00:06:15.691 --> 00:06:17.921
Together, they formed what many

00:06:17.921 --> 00:06:20.391
saw as the perfect imperial couple.

00:06:21.661 --> 00:06:23.761
However, tragedy struck.

00:06:24.101 --> 00:06:26.331
Germanicus, this heroic military

00:06:26.331 --> 00:06:28.881
leader who seemed poised to become

00:06:28.881 --> 00:06:31.441
the next emperor, died suddenly in

00:06:31.441 --> 00:06:35.035
Syria in AD 19, at the age of 33.

00:06:36.361 --> 00:06:39.781
There are rumours he was poisoned, perhaps

00:06:39.841 --> 00:06:42.871
on Tiberius’ orders, or perhaps it was one

00:06:42.871 --> 00:06:44.901
of the many bugs that could have proved

00:06:44.901 --> 00:06:47.161
fatal for travelling soldiers back then.

00:06:48.243 --> 00:06:50.213
In any case, he left behind

00:06:50.223 --> 00:06:52.183
a widow and six children.

00:06:53.463 --> 00:06:55.823
Among them was a boy named

00:06:55.873 --> 00:06:58.687
Gaius Julius Caesar Germanicus.

00:06:59.423 --> 00:07:02.663
But the soldiers had another name for him.

00:07:03.823 --> 00:07:06.213
As a child, this boy would often

00:07:06.213 --> 00:07:08.193
visit his father’s military camps

00:07:08.503 --> 00:07:10.843
dressed in a tiny soldier’s outfit,

00:07:11.303 --> 00:07:13.283
complete with little leather boots.

00:07:14.603 --> 00:07:17.403
The soldiers nicknamed him “Little

00:07:17.423 --> 00:07:19.963
Boots”, “Caligula” in Latin.

00:07:21.283 --> 00:07:23.743
Although he is believed to have hated

00:07:23.743 --> 00:07:26.633
the nickname as an adult, and never used

00:07:26.633 --> 00:07:29.983
it himself, it stuck, and I’ll continue

00:07:29.983 --> 00:07:32.393
to use it for the rest of this episode.

00:07:33.483 --> 00:07:36.743
Now, after Germanicus’s death, his

00:07:36.753 --> 00:07:40.023
widow openly accused Tiberius of murder,

00:07:40.493 --> 00:07:42.423
which was not a particularly smart

00:07:42.423 --> 00:07:45.173
thing to do, especially to an emperor

00:07:45.173 --> 00:07:48.543
as malicious and sadistic as Tiberius.

00:07:49.423 --> 00:07:51.273
She was banished, and she

00:07:51.293 --> 00:07:53.283
eventually died of starvation.

00:07:54.353 --> 00:07:56.279
Two of Caligula’s brothers were

00:07:56.279 --> 00:07:58.813
either imprisoned or executed.

00:07:59.623 --> 00:08:02.203
Caligula, however, survived.

00:08:03.453 --> 00:08:06.523
And not only did he survive, but

00:08:06.653 --> 00:08:09.133
when he was 19, he was brought

00:08:09.343 --> 00:08:12.183
to live with Tiberius, in Capri,

00:08:12.443 --> 00:08:14.093
just off the coast of Naples.

00:08:15.433 --> 00:08:18.613
Now, Caligula knew what Tiberius

00:08:18.613 --> 00:08:21.003
stood accused of: the murder of his

00:08:21.003 --> 00:08:23.823
father, and he knew what Tiberius

00:08:23.823 --> 00:08:25.633
had done to the rest of his family.

00:08:26.833 --> 00:08:30.433
And on the island, he also saw what fate

00:08:30.713 --> 00:08:33.753
awaited anyone who crossed the sadistic

00:08:33.753 --> 00:08:36.553
emperor: being pushed off a high cliff

00:08:36.843 --> 00:08:39.023
if they were lucky, and being slowly

00:08:39.073 --> 00:08:41.063
tortured to death if they weren’t.

00:08:42.103 --> 00:08:45.363
So, if Caligula did feel resentment

00:08:45.513 --> 00:08:47.783
towards Tiberius, which was clearly

00:08:47.853 --> 00:08:49.753
perfectly reasonable, he kept

00:08:49.803 --> 00:08:52.113
those feelings locked up inside.

00:08:52.813 --> 00:08:55.973
He flattered Tiberius; he never mentioned

00:08:55.973 --> 00:08:59.103
his father once, and he learned how to

00:08:59.103 --> 00:09:01.773
play the role of the obedient servant.

00:09:03.003 --> 00:09:06.273
When Tiberius finally died in AD

00:09:06.273 --> 00:09:09.773
37, Caligula was 24 years old.

00:09:10.753 --> 00:09:13.613
Now, there are some rumours that Caligula

00:09:13.663 --> 00:09:16.513
murdered Tiberius, with one account

00:09:16.693 --> 00:09:18.363
having him suffocate the man with a

00:09:18.363 --> 00:09:22.003
pillow, but these are unsubstantiated.

00:09:22.779 --> 00:09:26.243
Tiberius was 77 years old, which was

00:09:26.243 --> 00:09:28.963
a ripe old age at this time, and there

00:09:28.963 --> 00:09:31.463
is simply no evidence to suggest it

00:09:31.463 --> 00:09:33.773
was anything other than natural causes.

00:09:34.983 --> 00:09:38.063
It was, of course, good news for Caligula.

00:09:39.113 --> 00:09:41.933
Although he was relatively unknown

00:09:42.183 --> 00:09:44.783
as an individual in Rome, and he had

00:09:44.783 --> 00:09:46.893
little knowledge of the workings of

00:09:46.903 --> 00:09:49.573
Roman politics or the Roman army, he

00:09:49.573 --> 00:09:51.923
seemed like the obvious successor.

00:09:52.663 --> 00:09:55.113
He was the son of the heroic general

00:09:55.143 --> 00:09:58.043
Germanicus and the adopted grandson

00:09:58.243 --> 00:10:00.733
of Rome’s first emperor, Augustus.

00:10:01.223 --> 00:10:03.303
He seemed to embody a golden

00:10:03.303 --> 00:10:05.943
future, a new chapter for Rome.

00:10:07.173 --> 00:10:09.383
And, sure enough, he arrived in

00:10:09.383 --> 00:10:11.083
Rome and was hailed as emperor.

00:10:11.813 --> 00:10:14.463
The transition from unknown boy to

00:10:14.503 --> 00:10:16.333
commander of the world’s most powerful

00:10:16.373 --> 00:10:18.993
empire at the time was incredibly smooth.

00:10:20.273 --> 00:10:22.993
And for the first few months of his

00:10:22.993 --> 00:10:26.773
reign, Caligula seemed to live up to the

00:10:26.773 --> 00:10:29.233
hopes and dreams of the people of Rome.

00:10:29.943 --> 00:10:32.793
He threw vast gladiatorial games in

00:10:32.793 --> 00:10:34.973
celebration, he honoured all of his

00:10:35.033 --> 00:10:37.313
predecessors' last wishes, he gave

00:10:37.373 --> 00:10:40.063
every citizen of Rome a cash payment,

00:10:40.443 --> 00:10:42.853
and he made sure to double the cash

00:10:42.853 --> 00:10:44.853
payment for the Praetorian guard,

00:10:45.083 --> 00:10:47.453
the emperor’s personal armed unit.

00:10:48.723 --> 00:10:51.543
He also made a big deal of publicly

00:10:51.543 --> 00:10:54.183
destroying all of Tiberius’s written

00:10:54.183 --> 00:10:56.353
records of suspected treachery

00:10:56.513 --> 00:10:58.463
among the senators, symbolically

00:10:58.513 --> 00:11:00.903
burning them, as if saying, “This

00:11:00.943 --> 00:11:03.803
was the past, tomorrow is a new day”.

00:11:04.753 --> 00:11:07.043
He even said that he hadn’t read them,

00:11:07.423 --> 00:11:09.183
which would turn out to be a lie.

00:11:10.443 --> 00:11:12.813
In any case, the first few months of

00:11:12.813 --> 00:11:15.453
his rule were, as one contemporary

00:11:15.453 --> 00:11:17.923
historian put it, a "Golden Age"

00:11:17.993 --> 00:11:20.023
of happiness and prosperity.

00:11:20.963 --> 00:11:23.713
But, seven months or so after becoming

00:11:23.743 --> 00:11:26.143
emperor, he fell seriously ill.

00:11:27.403 --> 00:11:30.223
It’s not clear what this illness was,

00:11:30.443 --> 00:11:33.093
whether he caught it randomly or whether

00:11:33.093 --> 00:11:35.983
he was poisoned in some way, but for

00:11:36.003 --> 00:11:38.843
almost a month, he was at death’s door.

00:11:39.213 --> 00:11:40.393
It looked like he could

00:11:40.393 --> 00:11:42.223
have died at any moment.

00:11:43.393 --> 00:11:46.497
This being ancient Rome, senators were

00:11:46.497 --> 00:11:49.053
scurrying around making preparations,

00:11:49.393 --> 00:11:52.123
both for the eventuality that he wouldn’t

00:11:52.143 --> 00:11:54.693
recover and succumbed to his illness,

00:11:54.983 --> 00:11:57.183
and that he would make a full recovery.

00:11:58.383 --> 00:12:01.193
One politician, and man of noble

00:12:01.193 --> 00:12:04.503
blood, Atanius Secundus, had what he

00:12:04.503 --> 00:12:06.403
must have thought was a cunning idea.

00:12:07.203 --> 00:12:09.003
He publicly pledged that he would

00:12:09.003 --> 00:12:11.573
fight in the arena as a gladiator

00:12:11.833 --> 00:12:13.793
if only Caligula recovered.

00:12:15.263 --> 00:12:17.283
Presumably, he thought it

00:12:17.303 --> 00:12:19.083
was a win-win situation.

00:12:19.893 --> 00:12:22.593
If Caligula died, which seemed highly

00:12:22.593 --> 00:12:25.123
probable, he could point at how dedicated

00:12:25.143 --> 00:12:27.553
he had been to the emperor, and how he'd

00:12:27.571 --> 00:12:29.723
been willing to fight and most probably

00:12:29.733 --> 00:12:32.663
die in the arena for his cherished master.

00:12:34.103 --> 00:12:37.193
And if Caligula made a full recovery,

00:12:37.533 --> 00:12:39.373
he would hear of this pledge and be

00:12:39.383 --> 00:12:41.953
so impressed by the man’s loyalty

00:12:42.263 --> 00:12:44.563
that he would be richly rewarded.

00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:49.313
Caligula did make a full recovery, but

00:12:49.863 --> 00:12:52.043
it seems that after this return from

00:12:52.043 --> 00:12:55.003
the brink of death, something changed.

00:12:55.923 --> 00:12:58.243
He heard about the senator’s bold

00:12:58.253 --> 00:13:00.233
promise to fight in the arena,

00:13:00.683 --> 00:13:02.943
and told him, in no uncertain

00:13:02.943 --> 00:13:05.493
terms, “ok then, get on with it”.

00:13:06.983 --> 00:13:09.903
The man, who was not in great shape and

00:13:10.103 --> 00:13:12.753
had never held a sword before, was duly

00:13:12.763 --> 00:13:15.773
marched into the gladiatorial area and

00:13:15.773 --> 00:13:18.473
mown down by a professional gladiator.

00:13:19.693 --> 00:13:21.313
From that point on, the

00:13:21.323 --> 00:13:23.203
honeymoon period of Caligula’s

00:13:23.333 --> 00:13:26.353
reign was well and truly over.

00:13:27.143 --> 00:13:28.973
The generous young emperor, the

00:13:29.183 --> 00:13:31.073
son of Germanicus, the darling

00:13:31.073 --> 00:13:33.293
of Rome, seemed to vanish.

00:13:33.973 --> 00:13:36.353
What replaced him was a ruler

00:13:36.733 --> 00:13:39.243
who seemed to revel in cruelty,

00:13:39.573 --> 00:13:41.743
humiliation, and excess.

00:13:43.033 --> 00:13:44.733
Executions became an

00:13:44.753 --> 00:13:46.533
almost daily occurrence.

00:13:47.023 --> 00:13:48.893
He would invite senators to dine

00:13:48.893 --> 00:13:51.393
with him, serve them the finest

00:13:51.393 --> 00:13:53.893
food, and then, at the height of the

00:13:53.893 --> 00:13:56.383
feast, casually order their deaths.

00:13:57.243 --> 00:14:00.510
He delighted in seeing people squirm.

00:14:00.763 --> 00:14:02.543
Prisoners were executed

00:14:02.573 --> 00:14:04.513
in front of him for sport.

00:14:05.373 --> 00:14:08.093
Sometimes he would order people slowly

00:14:08.133 --> 00:14:10.563
tortured, so he could watch their agony.

00:14:11.673 --> 00:14:14.423
The Roman historian Suetonius even

00:14:14.423 --> 00:14:17.153
claims he enjoyed watching executions

00:14:17.433 --> 00:14:19.903
scheduled for his mealtimes as if it

00:14:19.903 --> 00:14:22.113
were a form of light entertainment.

00:14:23.203 --> 00:14:25.403
Then there were the humiliations.

00:14:26.293 --> 00:14:28.783
Senators were forced to run for long

00:14:28.783 --> 00:14:31.193
distances alongside his chariot, like

00:14:31.343 --> 00:14:33.623
stable boys rather than statesmen.

00:14:34.723 --> 00:14:36.983
And this was layered on top

00:14:37.193 --> 00:14:38.613
of the sexual depravity.

00:14:39.903 --> 00:14:42.593
He is said to have prostituted the wives

00:14:42.623 --> 00:14:45.383
of noblemen, inviting senators and their

00:14:45.383 --> 00:14:48.813
wives to banquets, then forcing the wives,

00:14:49.103 --> 00:14:52.233
one by one, into side rooms, forcing them

00:14:52.233 --> 00:14:54.813
to have sex with him and then describing

00:14:54.813 --> 00:14:56.943
their performance in intimate detail,

00:14:57.283 --> 00:14:59.443
publicly, in front of their husbands.

00:15:00.623 --> 00:15:01.743
There are accounts of him

00:15:01.743 --> 00:15:04.043
creating a brothel inside the

00:15:04.043 --> 00:15:05.943
imperial palace, complete with

00:15:05.953 --> 00:15:08.133
hundreds of women and young boys.

00:15:09.293 --> 00:15:11.973
And when it wasn’t humiliation and

00:15:12.113 --> 00:15:14.743
sexual depravity, he is also remembered

00:15:14.743 --> 00:15:17.133
by historians as an ineffective

00:15:17.313 --> 00:15:19.213
and cowardly leader of Rome.

00:15:19.973 --> 00:15:22.393
One account has him marching his troops

00:15:22.393 --> 00:15:24.813
northwards, as if to attack Great

00:15:24.823 --> 00:15:27.673
Britain, but after lining his troops

00:15:27.693 --> 00:15:30.583
up on the beach in Gaul, he orders

00:15:30.583 --> 00:15:33.233
them to collect seashells instead

00:15:33.243 --> 00:15:35.533
of continue their mission, declaring

00:15:35.533 --> 00:15:37.703
these the “spoils of the ocean”.

00:15:38.593 --> 00:15:40.923
To many, this became a perfect

00:15:40.953 --> 00:15:43.873
image of his reign: playing at war

00:15:44.103 --> 00:15:46.273
while humiliating Rome’s soldiers.

00:15:47.273 --> 00:15:49.423
And then, perhaps most famously,

00:15:49.713 --> 00:15:51.913
came his obsession with divinity.

00:15:53.003 --> 00:15:55.573
Previous and subsequent emperors became

00:15:55.583 --> 00:15:58.933
deified after death, but Caligula

00:15:58.953 --> 00:16:01.553
demanded worship in his own lifetime.

00:16:02.603 --> 00:16:05.343
He had temples erected to his own glory,

00:16:05.643 --> 00:16:08.493
with priests appointed to offer sacrifices

00:16:08.573 --> 00:16:10.913
to him as though he were Jupiter.

00:16:11.683 --> 00:16:13.513
He appeared in public dressed

00:16:13.513 --> 00:16:16.923
as Apollo, Mercury, even Venus,

00:16:17.023 --> 00:16:19.393
the female goddess of love.

00:16:20.183 --> 00:16:21.793
He reportedly once appeared in the

00:16:21.793 --> 00:16:24.393
theatre dressed as Venus, complete

00:16:24.393 --> 00:16:27.083
with wig and dress, delighting in the

00:16:27.123 --> 00:16:29.763
outrage of Rome’s conservative senators.

00:16:30.273 --> 00:16:33.153
He simply didn’t care what Roman high

00:16:33.153 --> 00:16:35.223
society thought about him; he threw

00:16:35.233 --> 00:16:37.753
money hand over fist at the Praetorian

00:16:37.757 --> 00:16:41.123
guard and knew that this money assured

00:16:41.123 --> 00:16:43.523
loyalty, and therefore protection.

00:16:44.423 --> 00:16:47.093
Well, it did for a while, as

00:16:47.093 --> 00:16:48.993
we’ll discover in a few minutes.

00:16:49.563 --> 00:16:52.043
Protected by a seemingly loyal imperial

00:16:52.043 --> 00:16:54.863
guard and with his ruthlessness against

00:16:54.863 --> 00:16:57.393
political enemies well known, it seemed

00:16:57.663 --> 00:17:00.293
there was nobody or nothing to stop him.

00:17:01.223 --> 00:17:03.313
He spent lavishly, not just on

00:17:03.313 --> 00:17:05.963
himself but on public projects.

00:17:06.583 --> 00:17:09.153
He built pleasure-galleys to cruise the

00:17:09.153 --> 00:17:12.353
Bay of Naples: vast ships with baths,

00:17:12.853 --> 00:17:16.193
colonnades, banquet-halls and even vines.

00:17:17.173 --> 00:17:18.993
In a lake just south of Rome,

00:17:19.223 --> 00:17:21.383
Lake Nemi, he launched colossal

00:17:21.413 --> 00:17:23.483
barges with marble flooring.

00:17:24.163 --> 00:17:25.923
As a quick side note for the

00:17:25.943 --> 00:17:27.863
seriously dedicated listeners among

00:17:27.873 --> 00:17:30.543
you, you may remember these barges

00:17:30.673 --> 00:17:33.633
from episode number 516, on the

00:17:33.633 --> 00:17:35.353
history of underwater exploration.

00:17:35.893 --> 00:17:36.763
Well done if so.

00:17:37.393 --> 00:17:39.203
Anyway, back to Caligula.

00:17:39.993 --> 00:17:43.653
At the start of AD 41, not even 4

00:17:43.653 --> 00:17:46.733
years into his rule, clearly, some

00:17:46.733 --> 00:17:48.983
people were thinking enough was enough.

00:17:50.353 --> 00:17:54.433
On January 24th, AD 41, he was preparing

00:17:54.433 --> 00:17:57.393
for a trip to Alexandria, in Egypt.

00:17:58.723 --> 00:18:00.343
He had been doing one of his favourite

00:18:00.393 --> 00:18:03.673
activities–watching gladiatorial games–and

00:18:03.823 --> 00:18:06.493
was heading inside for a spot of lunch.

00:18:07.413 --> 00:18:09.253
He had been told that there was a group

00:18:09.283 --> 00:18:12.043
of young boys who were practising, and

00:18:12.393 --> 00:18:14.223
could he come and spare a few words?

00:18:15.533 --> 00:18:17.853
As he was about to address the boys,

00:18:18.343 --> 00:18:20.803
two of his trusted Praetorian guards

00:18:21.203 --> 00:18:24.123
pounced on him, stabbing him a total of

00:18:24.251 --> 00:18:28.043
30 times in the neck, chest and genitals.

00:18:28.653 --> 00:18:30.583
One report even has them

00:18:30.593 --> 00:18:32.893
stripping and eating his flesh.

00:18:33.973 --> 00:18:36.773
Caligula, “Little Boots”, was dead.

00:18:37.983 --> 00:18:41.423
Now, as for the motivations behind this

00:18:41.443 --> 00:18:43.733
assassination, there is no evidence

00:18:43.753 --> 00:18:46.533
of a wide plot among senators for

00:18:46.563 --> 00:18:49.193
moral grounds, for the purposes of

00:18:49.443 --> 00:18:51.873
“saving Rome”, or anything like that.

00:18:52.783 --> 00:18:54.623
One hypothesis is that

00:18:54.793 --> 00:18:56.143
it was more personal.

00:18:57.563 --> 00:18:59.843
The man who is said to have landed

00:18:59.843 --> 00:19:02.983
the first blow, Cassius Chaerea, was

00:19:02.983 --> 00:19:05.373
a brave and distinguished Praetorian,

00:19:06.033 --> 00:19:08.753
but he was often teased by Caligula

00:19:09.013 --> 00:19:10.953
for having a high-pitched voice,

00:19:11.103 --> 00:19:14.103
and being effeminate in his manners.

00:19:14.953 --> 00:19:18.033
So yes, Caligula might have been seriously

00:19:18.043 --> 00:19:21.073
unhinged and utterly inappropriate as

00:19:21.073 --> 00:19:24.153
a Roman emperor, but one theory is that

00:19:24.163 --> 00:19:26.943
he was murdered for being a bully rather

00:19:26.943 --> 00:19:29.173
than anything more strategic than that.

00:19:30.433 --> 00:19:33.663
And on this note, much of what we know

00:19:33.723 --> 00:19:36.523
about Caligula as a man and his reign

00:19:36.943 --> 00:19:39.453
comes down to only a few sources that

00:19:39.453 --> 00:19:41.813
were written decades after his death.

00:19:42.523 --> 00:19:45.283
These were second, often third-hand

00:19:45.283 --> 00:19:47.483
accounts, and there is little

00:19:47.483 --> 00:19:49.423
way of verifying these claims.

00:19:50.583 --> 00:19:53.053
The most famous example is one that

00:19:53.053 --> 00:19:54.513
you might be surprised hasn’t come

00:19:54.513 --> 00:19:57.003
up yet: that he “made his favourite

00:19:57.023 --> 00:19:59.303
horse a senator”, and this is

00:19:59.303 --> 00:20:01.373
an example of how insane he was.

00:20:02.543 --> 00:20:05.223
Firstly, this isn’t historically

00:20:05.223 --> 00:20:07.513
accurate, in that the historian recalling

00:20:07.513 --> 00:20:10.633
it says that Caligula suggested that

00:20:10.633 --> 00:20:12.143
he would make his horse a consul.

00:20:13.283 --> 00:20:15.103
And secondly, it was almost

00:20:15.103 --> 00:20:17.783
certainly a joke by Caligula, and

00:20:17.953 --> 00:20:20.243
one that the historian didn’t get.

00:20:20.853 --> 00:20:23.293
We know that Caligula loved playing

00:20:23.293 --> 00:20:26.513
jokes and had a devilish sense of humour,

00:20:26.953 --> 00:20:29.663
and it seems much more probable that

00:20:29.703 --> 00:20:31.743
either he was planning on doing this to

00:20:31.903 --> 00:20:34.763
ridicule his senators, or that he made

00:20:34.763 --> 00:20:37.203
a passing comment along the lines of

00:20:37.763 --> 00:20:40.023
“so and so is so useless that my horse

00:20:40.023 --> 00:20:41.553
could govern better than they could”.

00:20:42.433 --> 00:20:44.343
He wasn’t actually planning

00:20:44.343 --> 00:20:45.703
to make his horse a senator.

00:20:46.613 --> 00:20:49.223
So, to wrap things up, Caligula

00:20:49.433 --> 00:20:51.533
met his end at the hands of the

00:20:51.533 --> 00:20:53.033
men he thought he could trust.

00:20:53.603 --> 00:20:56.333
And they didn’t just kill him; shortly

00:20:56.333 --> 00:20:59.013
after he was killed, so too were his wife

00:20:59.053 --> 00:21:01.573
and young daughter, in order to completely

00:21:01.863 --> 00:21:04.213
eradicate all lines of succession.

00:21:05.143 --> 00:21:07.773
Instead, his uncle, Claudius, was

00:21:07.773 --> 00:21:10.473
made emperor, and he ruled for 13

00:21:10.473 --> 00:21:12.083
years before the subject of the

00:21:12.083 --> 00:21:14.067
next episode, Nero, took over.

00:21:15.455 --> 00:21:17.743
As for Caligula, he didn’t even rule

00:21:17.743 --> 00:21:20.713
for four years, but his name is forever

00:21:20.713 --> 00:21:24.263
associated with cruelty, despotism, and

00:21:24.283 --> 00:21:27.563
the perils of unchecked absolute power.

00:21:29.083 --> 00:21:31.183
OK, then, that is it for today's

00:21:31.183 --> 00:21:34.003
episode on Caligula, the potential

00:21:34.033 --> 00:21:36.463
golden boy turned sadistic killer.

00:21:36.853 --> 00:21:38.093
I hope it's been an interesting one

00:21:38.343 --> 00:21:39.913
and that you've learnt something new.

00:21:40.593 --> 00:21:42.093
As always, I'd love to know what

00:21:42.123 --> 00:21:43.453
you thought of this episode.

00:21:43.753 --> 00:21:44.853
You can head right into our

00:21:44.853 --> 00:21:46.393
community forum, which is at

00:21:46.393 --> 00:21:49.013
community.leonardoenglish.com and get

00:21:49.013 --> 00:21:51.133
chatting away to other curious minds.

00:21:51.793 --> 00:21:53.403
As a reminder, this is part

00:21:53.413 --> 00:21:55.873
one of a three-part mini-series

00:21:56.063 --> 00:21:58.323
on the theme of Roman Tyrants.

00:21:58.523 --> 00:22:00.443
Next up it’ll be Nero, and in

00:22:00.443 --> 00:22:02.433
part three, it will be Commodus.
