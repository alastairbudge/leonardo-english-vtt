Hello, hello, hello, and welcome

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.770
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:12.580
Minds, by Leonardo English, the show

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.419
where you can listen to fascinating

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.950
stories and learn weird and wonderful

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.919
things about the world at the same

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.549
time as improving your English.

00:00:21.129 --> 00:00:23.500
I'm Alastair Budge, and over the

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.740
past few weeks, we’ve had quite a

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.889
few heavy topics: Roman tyrants,

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.810
hijackings, and American criminals.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.759
So today we’re talking about something

00:00:34.889 --> 00:00:37.420
completely different: happiness.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.230
It’s something we all want to be;

00:00:40.779 --> 00:00:42.879
it’s something that we all can be,

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.730
but what does happiness really mean?

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.480
Can it ever be truly measured, and

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.360
what, according to the Global Happiness

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.180
Report, really makes a person happy?.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.989
OK then, let's talk about happiness.

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:03.229
Dictionaries are sometimes pretty useless.

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.759
If you look up “happiness” in a

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.369
dictionary, it’ll probably say something

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.580
like “the state of being happy”.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.289
So you look up “happy”, and it’ll

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:15.679
say something like “feeling or

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:17.539
showing pleasure or contentment”,

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.929
or “a state of well-being”.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.270
And there isn’t much reason to look

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.289
up the definition of “happy”, at

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:27.649
least in a monolingual dictionary.

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:30.330
I know what it means, you know what it

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.270
means, from an office on the 90th floor

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.320
of a skyscraper in Tokyo to a Kalahari

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.810
Bushman, we might have different words

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.570
for it, but we know what it means.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.220
It, of course, means different things

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.410
to different people; different things

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.540
make different people happy, there

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.679
are different types of happiness,

00:01:51.879 --> 00:01:54.400
and something that makes one person

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.160
happy might make another person sad.

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.819
What is universal is that happiness

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:02.960
is something humans, throughout

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.480
history, have always sought.

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:09.559
Happiness as a goal in itself might

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.569
be more of a recent ideal, but it

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.500
seems reasonable to suppose that even

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.370
early hunter-gatherer communities

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.420
tens of thousands of years ago would

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.740
have pursued activities that would

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.899
have brought them happiness, whether

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:27.079
that was sitting around a fire and

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:29.680
eating a roasted rabbit together, or

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:31.990
painting animals on the walls of caves

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:34.300
and telling stories to their children.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.469
One can imagine that a caveman, his belly

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:41.430
full, his partner and children singing

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.489
songs around him, his face warmed by the

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.369
sun setting in the west, and just about

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.379
to retire to his cave for the evening,

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:52.110
might have thought, “life is good”.

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.000
Perhaps he would even have declared

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.380
something along the lines of “I am happy”.

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:02.420
Fast forward to the modern era, and

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.729
we have scientists, statisticians,

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:07.890
economists and even governments trying

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.820
to measure happiness, using it as

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.190
a yardstick for the well-being of a

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.969
country, as an alternative to metrics

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:18.709
like GDP, Gross Domestic Product.

00:03:19.429 --> 00:03:23.110
So, can happiness really be measured?

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.539
And before we can measure it, we need

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.660
to ask: what exactly are we measuring?

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.279
Is happiness the fleeting pleasure of

00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:35.879
a slice of rich chocolate cake, or a

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.529
glass of wine after a long day at work?

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:41.420
Is it the satisfaction we might get

00:03:41.529 --> 00:03:43.239
after completing something difficult?

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:46.540
A long run, or having a conversation

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:47.890
in English that you might

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:49.200
have thought you never could?

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:52.519
Is it the longer-term satisfaction

00:03:52.861 --> 00:03:55.209
of a life well lived, someone

00:03:55.219 --> 00:03:56.629
looking back on their life and

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:59.039
thinking, “I am proud of myself”?

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:03.019
Is it meaning, purpose, joy,

00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:06.010
contentment, or all of those things?

00:04:07.149 --> 00:04:09.579
Psychologists often distinguish

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:12.039
between two broad types of happiness:

00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:14.659
hedonic happiness, which is about

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.839
pleasure and the absence of pain, and

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:20.616
something called eudaimonic happiness,

00:04:20.696 --> 00:04:23.696
which is about purpose, growth, and

00:04:23.856 --> 00:04:25.756
living in line with your values.

00:04:26.506 --> 00:04:28.376
This is actually something that goes

00:04:28.436 --> 00:04:31.016
all the way back to Aristotle, the

00:04:31.226 --> 00:04:33.806
4th-century BC Greek Philosopher

00:04:34.116 --> 00:04:35.556
who spent considerable time

00:04:35.756 --> 00:04:37.666
addressing the question of happiness.

00:04:38.256 --> 00:04:41.316
Now, Aristotle didn’t exactly

00:04:41.546 --> 00:04:44.016
split happiness into two categories

00:04:44.196 --> 00:04:46.116
the way modern psychologists do.

00:04:46.916 --> 00:04:50.036
His focus was on eudaimonia, which is

00:04:50.056 --> 00:04:53.056
often translated as “flourishing”, living

00:04:53.056 --> 00:04:55.916
a virtuous life in line with your values.

00:04:56.616 --> 00:04:59.586
He did talk about hedone, or pleasure,

00:04:59.696 --> 00:05:03.086
but he saw it as just one part of a

00:05:03.096 --> 00:05:06.026
good life, not equal to eudaimonia.

00:05:07.326 --> 00:05:10.036
Modern psychology has borrowed and

00:05:10.036 --> 00:05:13.236
adapted these ideas into what we now

00:05:13.266 --> 00:05:16.846
call hedonic and eudaimonic happiness.

00:05:17.956 --> 00:05:19.706
And then there’s an even more

00:05:19.706 --> 00:05:21.636
modern addition: what researchers

00:05:21.636 --> 00:05:23.746
call subjective well-being.

00:05:24.147 --> 00:05:26.967
That’s a catch-all term that usually

00:05:26.967 --> 00:05:30.287
combines three things: how satisfied

00:05:30.297 --> 00:05:33.167
you are with your life overall, how much

00:05:33.217 --> 00:05:35.867
positive emotion you experience, and how

00:05:35.867 --> 00:05:38.177
much negative emotion you experience.

00:05:38.587 --> 00:05:40.127
In other words, it’s to do

00:05:40.127 --> 00:05:42.407
with how happy you feel.

00:05:43.177 --> 00:05:45.587
Because, at the end of the day, that’s

00:05:45.587 --> 00:05:47.227
the only thing that matters, your

00:05:47.317 --> 00:05:49.767
perception of your own happiness.

00:05:50.417 --> 00:05:53.407
The caveman sitting around a fire 50,000

00:05:53.411 --> 00:05:56.297
years ago wasn’t thinking, “I wish I

00:05:56.307 --> 00:05:58.757
had a flat screen TV”, and there are

00:05:58.797 --> 00:06:01.547
plenty of people today who have plenty

00:06:01.547 --> 00:06:03.797
of things that theoretically make a

00:06:03.797 --> 00:06:07.407
person happy–a nice house, a secure job,

00:06:07.797 --> 00:06:10.977
a loving family–yet for whatever reason,

00:06:11.277 --> 00:06:13.577
they don’t feel satisfied themselves.

00:06:14.457 --> 00:06:18.157
So, even before we attempt to measure

00:06:18.157 --> 00:06:21.177
it, defining what we are measuring,

00:06:21.227 --> 00:06:24.537
what happiness is, is not exactly easy.

00:06:25.727 --> 00:06:28.227
Now, one of the first attempts to

00:06:28.247 --> 00:06:30.807
measure happiness came in the late

00:06:30.887 --> 00:06:33.297
18th century, with the father of the

00:06:33.297 --> 00:06:35.797
Utilitarian movement, Jeremy Bentham.

00:06:36.577 --> 00:06:39.627
He tried to mathematically calculate

00:06:39.677 --> 00:06:42.437
happiness, and his equation was

00:06:42.477 --> 00:06:44.817
based on subtracting painful

00:06:44.817 --> 00:06:47.067
activities from pleasurable ones.

00:06:47.867 --> 00:06:50.177
It was slightly more complicated

00:06:50.177 --> 00:06:53.047
than this, and activities were split

00:06:53.067 --> 00:06:55.947
up into seven factors: Intensity,

00:06:56.177 --> 00:06:58.977
Duration, Certainty, Proximity,

00:06:59.273 --> 00:07:01.777
Fecundity, Purity, and Extent.

00:07:02.697 --> 00:07:04.917
Now isn’t the time to go into all

00:07:04.917 --> 00:07:07.367
of these, and we do actually have a

00:07:07.367 --> 00:07:10.367
standalone episode on Jeremy Bentham

00:07:10.617 --> 00:07:14.427
– it’s episode number 116 – but the

00:07:14.427 --> 00:07:16.939
point is that it was an early attempt

00:07:16.947 --> 00:07:19.427
to account for the fact that pleasure

00:07:19.827 --> 00:07:22.767
and pain have different qualities.

00:07:23.767 --> 00:07:25.897
In other words, the pleasure you might

00:07:25.897 --> 00:07:29.087
get from eating an apple, let’s say, was

00:07:29.087 --> 00:07:32.207
worth less than the pain of being locked

00:07:32.217 --> 00:07:34.717
up in prison and tortured for 10 years.

00:07:35.387 --> 00:07:37.367
And the pleasure of knowing that

00:07:37.367 --> 00:07:39.227
you had saved the lives of tens of

00:07:39.227 --> 00:07:41.557
thousands of children was worth more

00:07:41.787 --> 00:07:44.014
than the pain of stubbing your toe.

00:07:44.947 --> 00:07:47.577
So Bentham was one of the first

00:07:47.627 --> 00:07:49.967
to dream of quantifying happiness.

00:07:50.787 --> 00:07:53.707
But his calculus stayed

00:07:53.727 --> 00:07:55.457
mostly theoretical.

00:07:56.307 --> 00:07:58.687
After all, if we assume that his

00:07:58.687 --> 00:08:00.607
weightings and calculations were

00:08:00.867 --> 00:08:03.377
100% correct, which they surely were

00:08:03.377 --> 00:08:06.087
not, then the process of calculating

00:08:06.127 --> 00:08:07.997
individual happiness would have been

00:08:08.007 --> 00:08:11.257
so long and complicated that it would

00:08:11.257 --> 00:08:13.777
firstly have been impractical, and

00:08:13.777 --> 00:08:16.307
secondly would have taken so long that

00:08:16.307 --> 00:08:17.917
its subject would no doubt have become

00:08:17.917 --> 00:08:20.217
quite unhappy while it was taking place.

00:08:21.677 --> 00:08:23.907
It wasn’t until the 20th century

00:08:24.367 --> 00:08:26.707
that psychologists began developing

00:08:26.777 --> 00:08:30.217
practical tools – surveys, scales,

00:08:30.217 --> 00:08:32.617
and experiments – to try to measure

00:08:32.667 --> 00:08:34.617
how happy people really were.

00:08:35.907 --> 00:08:39.227
And the most common tool, even today,

00:08:40.007 --> 00:08:42.187
is perhaps the simplest: the survey.

00:08:43.357 --> 00:08:45.157
You’ve almost certainly seen

00:08:45.157 --> 00:08:46.527
questions like these before:

00:08:46.967 --> 00:08:49.807
“On a scale of 1 to 10, how satisfied

00:08:49.847 --> 00:08:52.207
are you with your life as a whole?”

00:08:52.637 --> 00:08:54.937
“Taking all things together, would you

00:08:54.937 --> 00:08:57.537
say you are very happy, quite happy,

00:08:57.957 --> 00:09:00.397
not very happy, or not at all happy?”

00:09:01.567 --> 00:09:04.227
These so-called life satisfaction

00:09:04.227 --> 00:09:06.077
questions are the backbone

00:09:06.347 --> 00:09:08.047
of most happiness research.

00:09:08.397 --> 00:09:11.727
They are simple, easy to administer across

00:09:11.757 --> 00:09:14.417
large populations, and when you add them

00:09:14.417 --> 00:09:17.537
up, you can start to compare one country

00:09:17.537 --> 00:09:20.437
to another, or track changes over time.

00:09:21.867 --> 00:09:25.187
Now, surveys like this are neat,

00:09:25.327 --> 00:09:27.437
but they have a big limitation:

00:09:27.797 --> 00:09:29.817
they rely on people remembering

00:09:29.827 --> 00:09:32.327
and summarising their happiness.

00:09:33.177 --> 00:09:35.287
Psychologists know that memory

00:09:35.287 --> 00:09:38.107
is unreliable: we tend to

00:09:38.207 --> 00:09:40.347
overemphasise the highs and lows,

00:09:40.737 --> 00:09:44.267
and undercount the ordinary moments.

00:09:44.867 --> 00:09:47.187
This is sometimes referred to as the

00:09:47.407 --> 00:09:51.567
“peak–end rule”: when people recall

00:09:51.567 --> 00:09:53.927
an experience, they mostly remember

00:09:53.957 --> 00:09:56.907
the most intense moment, the “peak”,

00:09:57.207 --> 00:09:59.647
and how it concluded, the “end”.

00:10:00.075 --> 00:10:02.185
You sort of forget the bits in the middle.

00:10:02.765 --> 00:10:05.155
So if you really want to capture

00:10:05.165 --> 00:10:08.035
happiness more accurately, you need to

00:10:08.045 --> 00:10:10.605
measure it in the moment, rather than

00:10:10.655 --> 00:10:12.375
asking people to remember it later.

00:10:13.885 --> 00:10:14.915
Obviously, this is more

00:10:14.965 --> 00:10:17.285
complicated, but it is possible.

00:10:18.115 --> 00:10:19.495
That’s where a method called

00:10:19.505 --> 00:10:21.735
Experience Sampling comes in.

00:10:22.555 --> 00:10:25.325
This involves pinging people at random

00:10:25.325 --> 00:10:28.079
times of the day, with a text, an

00:10:28.129 --> 00:10:30.999
app notification, or even a beeper

00:10:30.999 --> 00:10:34.409
back in the 1980s, and asking: “How

00:10:34.409 --> 00:10:36.649
are you feeling right now? What

00:10:36.649 --> 00:10:38.619
are you doing? Who are you with?”

00:10:39.859 --> 00:10:42.449
The idea is that, by collecting hundreds

00:10:42.449 --> 00:10:45.359
or thousands of these little snapshots,

00:10:45.699 --> 00:10:48.569
you can build up a far more realistic

00:10:48.569 --> 00:10:50.599
picture of what makes people happy.

00:10:51.989 --> 00:10:54.869
And Experience Sampling studies have

00:10:54.869 --> 00:10:57.079
found some fascinating patterns.

00:10:57.859 --> 00:11:00.339
People tend to report being happiest

00:11:00.599 --> 00:11:03.489
when they’re socialising, exercising,

00:11:03.499 --> 00:11:06.419
or engaged in activities that give them

00:11:06.419 --> 00:11:09.109
a sense of flow, that feeling of being

00:11:09.109 --> 00:11:11.749
completely absorbed in what they’re doing.

00:11:12.989 --> 00:11:16.089
The situations in which they tend to be

00:11:16.179 --> 00:11:19.449
least happy are probably unsurprising:

00:11:19.959 --> 00:11:22.169
commuting, working in stressful

00:11:22.169 --> 00:11:24.469
conditions, or when they’re ill.

00:11:25.519 --> 00:11:27.669
If you are listening to this with a

00:11:27.719 --> 00:11:31.189
cold on a crowded commuter train, well,

00:11:31.229 --> 00:11:33.059
you’re probably feeling a bit rubbish.

00:11:33.909 --> 00:11:36.489
Now, self-reported happiness surveys,

00:11:36.899 --> 00:11:39.479
even these ”experience sampling”-style

00:11:39.479 --> 00:11:42.049
ones, only take us so far.

00:11:42.699 --> 00:11:44.679
Scientists have also looked at

00:11:44.809 --> 00:11:46.949
physiological measures: heart

00:11:46.949 --> 00:11:49.299
rate variability, levels of the

00:11:49.309 --> 00:11:51.309
stress hormone cortisol, and

00:11:51.599 --> 00:11:53.699
even patterns of brain activity.

00:11:54.612 --> 00:11:56.529
Neuroscientists have found that

00:11:56.529 --> 00:11:59.019
certain regions of the brain light

00:11:59.019 --> 00:12:01.239
up when people report feeling happy.

00:12:02.339 --> 00:12:04.549
When we feel happy, there are clear

00:12:04.669 --> 00:12:07.949
physiological changes and measuring

00:12:08.279 --> 00:12:10.569
these kinds of changes is the most

00:12:10.589 --> 00:12:12.639
accurate way to measure happiness,

00:12:12.899 --> 00:12:14.559
theoretically speaking, at least.

00:12:15.139 --> 00:12:17.669
But while these methods can be

00:12:17.679 --> 00:12:20.549
incredibly precise in a lab, they’re

00:12:20.549 --> 00:12:23.749
expensive, invasive, and not exactly

00:12:23.779 --> 00:12:25.719
practical for large populations.

00:12:27.259 --> 00:12:29.859
In recent years, researchers have tried a

00:12:29.859 --> 00:12:32.799
different approach altogether: big data.

00:12:33.799 --> 00:12:37.229
By analysing billions of words on social

00:12:37.229 --> 00:12:40.079
media, or even the emotional tone of

00:12:40.079 --> 00:12:42.789
song lyrics, they attempt to track

00:12:42.969 --> 00:12:46.079
collective happiness in real time.

00:12:47.339 --> 00:12:50.019
One famous study found that people’s

00:12:50.169 --> 00:12:52.459
tweets tended to be more positive in

00:12:52.459 --> 00:12:55.209
the morning, dip during the workday,

00:12:55.449 --> 00:12:57.799
and then rise again in the evening.

00:12:58.669 --> 00:13:00.039
Hardly surprising, perhaps.

00:13:01.029 --> 00:13:04.239
Another tracked changes in national mood

00:13:04.599 --> 00:13:07.619
based on how cheerful or gloomy song

00:13:07.619 --> 00:13:10.019
lyrics became over the course of decades.

00:13:10.949 --> 00:13:13.079
Interesting from the point of view

00:13:13.079 --> 00:13:14.469
of measuring the happiness of a

00:13:14.469 --> 00:13:17.339
wider population over time, but

00:13:17.889 --> 00:13:19.769
not particularly helpful when it

00:13:19.769 --> 00:13:22.009
comes to more granular measures.

00:13:22.619 --> 00:13:26.399
So from smartphones to surveys,

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:28.949
saliva samples to social media,

00:13:29.269 --> 00:13:30.659
there are now dozens of different

00:13:30.659 --> 00:13:33.439
ways to try to measure happiness.

00:13:34.149 --> 00:13:37.419
None of these is perfect, but there has

00:13:37.479 --> 00:13:39.639
been enough research into the subject

00:13:40.029 --> 00:13:41.909
over the course of several decades

00:13:42.209 --> 00:13:44.399
that there are some interesting themes

00:13:44.399 --> 00:13:46.659
and trends that researchers have seen

00:13:46.899 --> 00:13:49.649
about what makes someone happy, or not.

00:13:50.339 --> 00:13:51.739
Some of these will not be

00:13:51.739 --> 00:13:53.869
surprising; others might be.

00:13:54.749 --> 00:13:57.249
One of the clearest findings is that

00:13:57.329 --> 00:14:00.939
money matters, but only up to a point.

00:14:01.819 --> 00:14:03.119
When people are struggling to

00:14:03.129 --> 00:14:05.939
meet their basic needs, more money

00:14:06.209 --> 00:14:08.129
reliably increases happiness.

00:14:08.639 --> 00:14:10.559
The difference between living on two

00:14:10.559 --> 00:14:14.209
dollars a day and ten dollars is enormous.

00:14:14.569 --> 00:14:17.399
But once you reach a certain level

00:14:17.399 --> 00:14:20.109
of comfort, the effect flattens out.

00:14:20.819 --> 00:14:24.509
Going from an income of €10,000 a year

00:14:24.789 --> 00:14:28.239
to €20,000 makes a big difference.

00:14:28.539 --> 00:14:33.069
But going from €100,000 to €200,000?

00:14:33.069 --> 00:14:33.809
Much less so.

00:14:34.989 --> 00:14:37.049
Another theme is the importance

00:14:37.049 --> 00:14:38.519
of social connections.

00:14:39.149 --> 00:14:42.399
Time and time again, the research shows

00:14:42.409 --> 00:14:44.789
that people who feel they can rely on

00:14:44.799 --> 00:14:47.359
friends, family, or their community

00:14:47.629 --> 00:14:49.609
report higher levels of happiness.

00:14:50.549 --> 00:14:53.119
Loneliness, on the other hand, is one of

00:14:53.119 --> 00:14:56.079
the strongest predictors of unhappiness.

00:14:57.159 --> 00:15:00.089
During the Covid-19 pandemic, when

00:15:00.439 --> 00:15:03.339
isolation was forced on much of the world,

00:15:03.909 --> 00:15:07.319
surveys found sharp declines in happiness,

00:15:07.529 --> 00:15:09.439
especially among younger people.

00:15:10.569 --> 00:15:12.079
Spending time with other people,

00:15:12.579 --> 00:15:15.259
perhaps unsurprisingly, is positively

00:15:15.259 --> 00:15:17.629
correlated with self-reported happiness.

00:15:18.279 --> 00:15:21.149
And the worrying thing is that, across

00:15:21.199 --> 00:15:23.879
much of the world, people are reporting

00:15:24.139 --> 00:15:26.409
spending more and more time alone.

00:15:27.179 --> 00:15:28.189
One of the markers of

00:15:28.189 --> 00:15:30.339
this is “eating alone”.

00:15:31.179 --> 00:15:34.199
According to the 2025 World Happiness

00:15:34.199 --> 00:15:38.899
Report, “In 2023, roughly 1 in 4

00:15:38.899 --> 00:15:41.669
Americans reported eating all of

00:15:41.669 --> 00:15:43.309
their meals alone the previous

00:15:43.309 --> 00:15:47.579
day – an increase of 53% since 2003.”

00:15:48.847 --> 00:15:52.157
And in the same report, household

00:15:52.157 --> 00:15:54.547
size is positively correlated with

00:15:54.557 --> 00:15:56.687
happiness, up to a point at least.

00:15:57.837 --> 00:16:00.357
According to the report, “In Mexico

00:16:00.357 --> 00:16:03.087
and Europe, a household size of four

00:16:03.117 --> 00:16:05.517
to five predicts the highest levels

00:16:05.517 --> 00:16:08.027
of happiness. Couples who live with

00:16:08.027 --> 00:16:10.827
at least one child, or couples who

00:16:10.827 --> 00:16:12.467
live with children and members of

00:16:12.467 --> 00:16:14.887
their extended family, have especially

00:16:14.887 --> 00:16:17.037
high average life satisfaction.”

00:16:17.967 --> 00:16:20.327
But the report goes on to acknowledge

00:16:20.607 --> 00:16:22.967
that people who live in very large

00:16:22.967 --> 00:16:26.357
households do report lower levels of

00:16:26.357 --> 00:16:29.057
happiness, but this is probably due to

00:16:29.057 --> 00:16:31.537
lower levels of economic satisfaction.

00:16:32.437 --> 00:16:34.747
Or to put it another way, it might be

00:16:34.747 --> 00:16:37.427
nice to live with lots of people, but

00:16:37.427 --> 00:16:39.427
not if you have to queue for 1 hour

00:16:39.547 --> 00:16:42.157
for a shower every day and there’s only

00:16:42.157 --> 00:16:44.727
one loaf of bread to feed 15 people.

00:16:45.917 --> 00:16:48.087
There’s also the role of trust.

00:16:48.957 --> 00:16:50.747
Countries where people believe

00:16:50.747 --> 00:16:52.967
that others can be trusted, that

00:16:53.207 --> 00:16:55.307
institutions are fair, and that

00:16:55.307 --> 00:16:58.177
corruption is relatively low, tend

00:16:58.377 --> 00:17:00.957
to report higher levels of wellbeing.

00:17:01.817 --> 00:17:03.137
It isn’t just about how much

00:17:03.157 --> 00:17:05.807
money a country has, but about

00:17:05.807 --> 00:17:08.997
how fair and safe life feels.

00:17:10.327 --> 00:17:14.047
To give you a personal example, I live in

00:17:14.047 --> 00:17:16.957
Sweden, a country that is always towards

00:17:16.957 --> 00:17:19.317
the top of these happiness reports.

00:17:20.007 --> 00:17:21.987
A few months ago, I was coming back

00:17:21.987 --> 00:17:24.757
from a swimming lesson with my son, and

00:17:24.807 --> 00:17:28.857
we, or rather I, accidentally left his

00:17:28.867 --> 00:17:31.707
favourite Spider-Man rucksack on the tram.

00:17:32.637 --> 00:17:35.817
He was very sad, but I went to the lost

00:17:35.817 --> 00:17:38.367
and found office the following day, and

00:17:38.367 --> 00:17:39.977
found that someone had handed it in.

00:17:40.637 --> 00:17:42.377
I had to pay a very small

00:17:42.627 --> 00:17:45.147
administration fee, and I got it back.

00:17:45.987 --> 00:17:49.747
This made me happy temporarily, and him

00:17:49.757 --> 00:17:52.127
very happy when I returned it to him,

00:17:52.607 --> 00:17:56.137
but it also made me happy on a deeper,

00:17:56.437 --> 00:17:58.917
more permanent level to think that I live

00:17:58.917 --> 00:18:01.057
in a place where someone will do that.

00:18:01.957 --> 00:18:03.577
Of course, it might not have been

00:18:03.577 --> 00:18:05.277
returned, which might have made me

00:18:05.297 --> 00:18:08.057
unhappy, so if I had been asked if

00:18:08.057 --> 00:18:10.246
I was happy immediately after I’d

00:18:10.246 --> 00:18:12.476
been told “sorry, nobody has handed

00:18:12.476 --> 00:18:14.696
that in”, this might have clouded my

00:18:14.696 --> 00:18:17.136
mood, which highlights a problem with

00:18:17.136 --> 00:18:19.126
this self-reporting sampling method.

00:18:19.756 --> 00:18:23.316
But it is a real-life, single data point.

00:18:24.376 --> 00:18:26.956
And in fact, this year’s Global Happiness

00:18:26.956 --> 00:18:30.076
Report made this sensation a core focus.

00:18:30.806 --> 00:18:33.496
One of the things they tracked was almost

00:18:33.496 --> 00:18:36.126
exactly this: how likely respondents

00:18:36.126 --> 00:18:38.626
believed it was that a dropped wallet

00:18:38.766 --> 00:18:40.846
would be returned, depending on

00:18:40.846 --> 00:18:42.496
whether it was found by a neighbour,

00:18:43.026 --> 00:18:45.186
a stranger, or a police officer.

00:18:46.116 --> 00:18:48.556
What they found was a definite

00:18:48.566 --> 00:18:50.896
trend: the more likely someone

00:18:50.906 --> 00:18:53.076
thought someone else was to do them

00:18:53.076 --> 00:18:55.626
a good deed, such as returning their

00:18:55.636 --> 00:18:57.756
lost wallet, the more likely they

00:18:57.756 --> 00:18:59.656
were to say that they were happy.

00:19:00.506 --> 00:19:02.546
There were exceptions, of course.

00:19:02.996 --> 00:19:05.646
Costa Rica is the sixth-happiest country

00:19:05.646 --> 00:19:08.366
in the world, on a self-reported basis,

00:19:08.626 --> 00:19:12.266
but comes 128th in terms of trust

00:19:12.286 --> 00:19:14.376
in a stranger to return a wallet.

00:19:15.196 --> 00:19:18.426
And Iran is the 99th happiest country

00:19:18.426 --> 00:19:20.656
in the world, so towards the bottom

00:19:20.926 --> 00:19:23.806
of the scale, but Iranians were the

00:19:23.806 --> 00:19:26.596
2nd most likely people to say that a

00:19:26.596 --> 00:19:28.846
stranger would return their wallet.

00:19:29.716 --> 00:19:31.896
There are exceptions, but there

00:19:31.896 --> 00:19:34.066
was a strong overall trend.

00:19:35.496 --> 00:19:38.016
And interestingly enough, this

00:19:38.016 --> 00:19:41.196
report compared the data on expected

00:19:41.216 --> 00:19:43.476
wallet return with data on other

00:19:43.486 --> 00:19:46.486
acts of “caring” for fellow citizens,

00:19:46.766 --> 00:19:48.816
such as donating to charity,

00:19:49.166 --> 00:19:51.526
volunteering, or helping a stranger.

00:19:52.456 --> 00:19:54.616
There was a general trend whereby

00:19:54.646 --> 00:19:57.406
people in countries ranked higher on

00:19:57.406 --> 00:20:00.226
these “caregiving” scores reported

00:20:00.296 --> 00:20:01.976
having higher levels of happiness.

00:20:02.396 --> 00:20:05.656
But the trend was much more defined

00:20:05.886 --> 00:20:08.006
for the countries that ranked highest

00:20:08.186 --> 00:20:10.866
on the “care receiving” metrics.

00:20:12.346 --> 00:20:15.366
To put it another way, yes, caring for

00:20:15.396 --> 00:20:18.166
others tends to have a positive effect

00:20:18.366 --> 00:20:21.896
on happiness, but the effect isn’t

00:20:21.936 --> 00:20:24.406
as great as living in a country where

00:20:24.436 --> 00:20:26.776
you expect others to care for you.

00:20:27.806 --> 00:20:28.796
Interesting, right?

00:20:29.616 --> 00:20:31.946
Now, to wrap things up, there is

00:20:32.036 --> 00:20:34.496
unquestionably more to happiness

00:20:34.606 --> 00:20:36.506
than believing a stranger is going

00:20:36.506 --> 00:20:38.706
to return your wallet, or in my

00:20:38.706 --> 00:20:40.926
case, your son’s Spider-Man rucksack.

00:20:41.566 --> 00:20:44.516
Happiness is messy, complicated,

00:20:44.996 --> 00:20:46.396
and impossible to pin down

00:20:46.396 --> 00:20:47.686
with complete precision.

00:20:48.396 --> 00:20:50.196
We can try, and we have got

00:20:50.206 --> 00:20:51.826
better and better at it.

00:20:52.596 --> 00:20:54.546
And we should keep on trying.

00:20:55.226 --> 00:20:57.866
After all, to quote one of the original

00:20:57.876 --> 00:21:00.006
thinkers on the concept of happiness,

00:21:00.396 --> 00:21:03.256
Aristotle, “Happiness is the meaning

00:21:03.556 --> 00:21:05.486
and the purpose of life, the whole

00:21:05.506 --> 00:21:08.426
aim and end of human existence”.

00:21:10.196 --> 00:21:12.336
OK, that is it for today's episode

00:21:12.376 --> 00:21:13.946
on the science of happiness.

00:21:14.186 --> 00:21:15.526
I hope it's been an interesting one

00:21:15.776 --> 00:21:17.356
and that you've learnt something new.

00:21:17.946 --> 00:21:19.896
I’ll put a link to the Global Happiness

00:21:19.896 --> 00:21:21.606
Report in the show notes, if you’d

00:21:21.606 --> 00:21:23.016
like to check that out yourself.

00:21:23.296 --> 00:21:25.066
You've been listening to English Learning

00:21:25.066 --> 00:21:27.666
for Curious Minds by Leonardo English.

00:21:28.176 --> 00:21:30.696
I'm Alastair Budge, you stay safe, and

00:21:30.696 --> 00:21:33.036
I'll catch you in the next episode.
