Hello, hello, hello, and welcome

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:10.280
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.170
Minds, by Leonardo English, the show

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:14.950
where you can listen to fascinating

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.540
stories and learn weird and wonderful

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.600
things about the world at the same

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.419
time as improving your English.

00:00:21.959 --> 00:00:25.360
I'm Alastair Budge, and today it’s part

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.560
two of our three-part mini-series on

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.570
Gli Anni Di Piombo, The Years of Lead.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.959
In case you missed part one, we set

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.670
the scene, reminded ourselves of some

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.170
modern Italian history, talked about

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.309
the various political groups involved,

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.786
and the tragic bombing at Milan’s

00:00:44.786 --> 00:00:48.090
Piazza Fontana in December 1969.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.430
Today, we are going to move into the

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.790
next, bloody stage: the Red Brigades

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.870
and the kidnapping of Aldo Moro.

00:00:57.209 --> 00:00:59.180
And next up, we’ll talk about how

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.419
it all came to a close, with the

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.050
bombing of the train station at

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.449
Bologna, and the shadow this period

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:08.270
still casts over the Italy of today.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.669
This mini-series is the sort of one

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.479
that will be much easier to follow if

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.320
you listen to it all in order, so just

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.210
in case you haven’t listened to part

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.200
one yet, now is probably the time to

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.590
press pause and catch up on that one.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.479
Ok, let’s not waste a minute, and learn

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.810
about Le Brigate Rosse, the Red Brigades.

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.230
There is a quote that’s often attributed

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.500
to Abraham Lincoln that goes “You can

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.110
please some of the people all of the

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.860
time, you can please all of the people

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.220
some of the time, but you can't please

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.280
all of the people all of the time”.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.460
As a politician, and indeed,

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.860
pretty much anyone in any position

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.160
of power, clearly it’s true.

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.270
People have different opinions and

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.320
beliefs, they want different things.

00:02:03.809 --> 00:02:06.649
Sometimes these interests overlap;

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.740
some people may always approve

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.289
of what you do, but not everyone

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.150
will always agree with you.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.780
And in the deeply fragmented

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.260
environment of post-war Italy,

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.949
this was especially true.

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.579
Communists, fascists, nationalists,

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.650
the Vatican, Americans,

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:31.310
rich, poor, north and south.

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.760
Finding common ground between all of these

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.879
often competing interest groups was, well,

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.000
not impossible, according to one man.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.990
Aldo Moro had been Prime Minister of

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:50.019
Italy five times: three times during

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.072
the 1960s, and twice during the 1970s.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.969
He was a senior figure within the

00:02:56.969 --> 00:02:59.990
Christian Democrat party, the centrist

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:02.109
political party that dominated

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.429
Italian politics for most of the

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.700
second half of the 20th century.

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.780
The second most powerful party at

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.940
the time was the communist party.

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.570
It had been gaining strength and

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.079
popularity throughout the 1970s,

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.409
and in the 1976 election — the first

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.349
election after the voting age was

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:28.080
reduced from 21 to 18 — it won 34%

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.100
of the vote, only narrowly trailing

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.401
the Christian Democrats’ 39%.

00:03:34.506 --> 00:03:38.900
And the remaining 27% was split between

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.930
smaller parties, from the neo-fascist

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.230
MSI to the socialists and republicans.

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.959
Finding any viable majority

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.830
seemed completely unworkable.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.569
For the Christian Democrats,

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:56.340
this would mean working with a

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.660
coalition of smaller parties with

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.110
completely opposing positions.

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.950
Or it would mean getting

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:05.530
into bed with the communists.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.130
Again, completely unworkable.

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.310
The Christian Democrats, or we can

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.150
just call them DC, for short, were

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.480
the continuity party: church, family,

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:20.369
traditional, conservative values.

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:23.759
The communists, the Partito Communista

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.020
Italiano, or PCI for short, well, they

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.470
were communists supported by Moscow.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.190
And this was the middle of the Cold War.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.150
It was never going to work.

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.960
Or so most people thought.

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:41.970
There was one person who

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.609
thought it could: Aldo Moro.

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.729
He had been working with the leader of

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.399
the communist party on something called

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.460
the “historic compromise”, a way to

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.180
work with the communists, making them

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.469
a partner in the heart of government.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.199
This had, if it’s possible, the

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.970
complete opposite effect of that

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:09.750
Lincoln quote we started with.

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:12.130
It pleased none of the

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:13.960
people all the time.

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.430
Moscow hated it because it brought the

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.020
Italian communists closer to the West.

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:23.170
The US hated it because it gave the

00:05:23.179 --> 00:05:26.150
communists a seat at the G7 table.

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.970
Domestically, the left opposed it

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.250
because it was seen as compromising

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.830
on key positions, and the right

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:37.090
opposed it for the same reason.

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.229
The then US Secretary of State, Henry

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:43.580
Kissinger, even had a warning for

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:47.040
Moro, reportedly telling him, “You stop

00:05:47.049 --> 00:05:50.310
doing this thing–this collaboration–or

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.280
you will be badly punished.”

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.159
Moro did not stop.

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.450
And he almost got there.

00:05:58.559 --> 00:06:01.429
However, on the morning of 16th

00:06:01.429 --> 00:06:04.310
March, 1978, as he was leaving for

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.700
a meeting, his car was ambushed.

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:09.480
Moro was dragged away

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.280
and held for 55 days.

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:14.699
The perpetrators were Le

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:17.100
Brigate Rosse, the Red Brigades.

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:20.000
Or at least, that is the official verdict.

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:24.350
The episode has gone down as the darkest

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:26.940
in the years of lead, the kidnapping

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.310
of one of the country’s longest

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.729
serving leaders in broad daylight, and

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:36.000
has been called Italy’s 9/11 moment.

00:06:37.009 --> 00:06:40.099
It is also to this day the subject

00:06:40.219 --> 00:06:43.010
of controversy and intrigue, with

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.140
many theories suggesting that the

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:48.150
official verdict may be omitting the

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:51.799
influence of everyone from the CIA, the

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.860
Stasi, the KGB, Mossad, Palestinians,

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:59.090
Masonic Lodges, and even the Mafia.

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:02.580
So, let’s return to that morning

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:06.730
of March 16th, 1978, the day now

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:09.800
remembered as the day of the strage

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.519
di via Fani — the Via Fani massacre.

00:07:14.133 --> 00:07:16.569
Moro’s car was on its way through

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:19.890
a quiet Roman street when, at 9

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:23.800
am, a Fiat 128 blocked the convoy.

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:26.929
A group of armed Red Brigades

00:07:26.929 --> 00:07:29.690
members, disguised as Alitalia

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:31.700
crew members, jumped out.

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:35.460
Within seconds, gunfire erupted.

00:07:36.109 --> 00:07:39.550
Ninety-one shots in less than two minutes.

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:43.260
When it all stopped, all five

00:07:43.429 --> 00:07:45.270
of Moro’s bodyguards were dead.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.330
Moro himself was bundled

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:49.780
into a waiting car.

00:07:51.256 --> 00:07:52.870
It was an attack carried

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:54.920
out with chilling precision.

00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:58.830
The Red Brigades weren’t just street

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:01.260
thugs; they were a highly organised

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:04.320
terrorist group, with cells, weapons

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:07.200
training, and an ideology that saw

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.060
themselves as soldiers in a revolutionary

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:12.350
war against the Italian state.

00:08:13.606 --> 00:08:16.006
A couple of days after the kidnapping,

00:08:16.366 --> 00:08:18.481
the Red Brigades released their first

00:08:18.481 --> 00:08:21.606
communication, claiming credit for Moro’s

00:08:21.616 --> 00:08:24.546
kidnapping, and sending a picture proving

00:08:24.556 --> 00:08:27.366
he was still alive, the famous image of

00:08:27.366 --> 00:08:29.736
him in front of the Brigate Rosse sign.

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:33.780
In this communication, they declared

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:36.689
that he would be put on a “People’s

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:39.779
Trial”, where he would answer the charges

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:42.669
of his crimes against the proletariat.

00:08:44.003 --> 00:08:47.823
For the next almost two months, 55

00:08:47.823 --> 00:08:50.473
days in total, the Red Brigades would

00:08:50.473 --> 00:08:52.873
release a series of communications,

00:08:53.183 --> 00:08:55.643
including letters written by Moro:

00:08:55.933 --> 00:08:57.913
to his political colleagues, to

00:08:57.913 --> 00:09:00.763
his wife, and even to the pope.

00:09:01.993 --> 00:09:05.643
In these letters, he begged for a deal

00:09:05.663 --> 00:09:08.463
to be made, pleading for his life.

00:09:09.853 --> 00:09:12.843
In them, he sounded like a broken

00:09:12.843 --> 00:09:16.653
man, terrified, abandoned, convinced

00:09:16.873 --> 00:09:19.013
that his colleagues were sacrificing

00:09:19.013 --> 00:09:20.983
him for political principle.

00:09:22.273 --> 00:09:24.583
These communications kept the public

00:09:24.653 --> 00:09:27.193
up to date with the “trial” and

00:09:27.513 --> 00:09:29.553
their demands for Moro’s release.

00:09:31.113 --> 00:09:33.473
Initially, the kidnappers demanded

00:09:33.473 --> 00:09:36.143
the release of 13 imprisoned

00:09:36.163 --> 00:09:38.223
members of The Red Brigades, but

00:09:38.533 --> 00:09:40.873
this was later reduced to one.

00:09:42.403 --> 00:09:44.293
And this was all played out

00:09:44.363 --> 00:09:46.643
very publicly, with the entire

00:09:46.693 --> 00:09:49.223
country watching on tenterhooks.

00:09:50.523 --> 00:09:52.833
And it was, of course, the subject of

00:09:52.853 --> 00:09:55.473
great debate, from the inner circles

00:09:55.473 --> 00:09:57.616
of government to the pensioners

00:09:57.753 --> 00:09:59.563
playing cards in the village bar:

00:10:00.163 --> 00:10:02.653
what could be done to get him home?

00:10:03.243 --> 00:10:04.373
Should the state

00:10:04.723 --> 00:10:06.533
negotiate with terrorists?

00:10:08.223 --> 00:10:11.408
On one side was the so-called linea della

00:10:11.408 --> 00:10:14.673
fermezza, the “hard line,” championed by

00:10:14.673 --> 00:10:17.413
the Prime Minister, Giulio Andreotti, and

00:10:17.413 --> 00:10:20.123
his Interior Minister, Francesco Cossiga.

00:10:21.273 --> 00:10:23.633
Their position was clear: the

00:10:23.633 --> 00:10:27.223
Republic must not bow to violence.

00:10:27.793 --> 00:10:29.903
To make a deal would only encourage

00:10:29.953 --> 00:10:32.083
more kidnappings, more bloodshed.

00:10:32.703 --> 00:10:35.133
And there was already more than enough.

00:10:36.643 --> 00:10:38.343
On the other side were those

00:10:38.343 --> 00:10:40.111
who favoured the linea della

00:10:40.111 --> 00:10:42.553
trattativa, the “soft line.”

00:10:43.823 --> 00:10:46.493
They argued that Moro’s life was more

00:10:46.493 --> 00:10:49.153
important than abstract principles,

00:10:49.363 --> 00:10:52.573
that saving him was worth compromise.

00:10:53.623 --> 00:10:56.395
Among them were several members of

00:10:56.395 --> 00:10:58.053
his own Christian Democratic Party,

00:10:58.493 --> 00:11:00.853
figures in the Socialist Party, and,

00:11:00.853 --> 00:11:02.963
of course, his desperate family.

00:11:04.133 --> 00:11:06.633
Even the Vatican tried to intervene.

00:11:07.713 --> 00:11:10.203
Pope Paul VI, who was a personal

00:11:10.213 --> 00:11:13.173
friend of Moro, made a heartfelt public

00:11:13.173 --> 00:11:17.673
appeal: “I beg you on my knees,” he

00:11:17.673 --> 00:11:20.113
said to the kidnappers, “give Aldo

00:11:20.113 --> 00:11:23.663
Moro back to his family, unharmed.”

00:11:25.223 --> 00:11:27.953
Yet the state’s position was clear:

00:11:28.403 --> 00:11:31.563
we will not negotiate with terrorists.

00:11:32.643 --> 00:11:34.363
While all of this was going on,

00:11:34.693 --> 00:11:36.613
there was a frantic search to

00:11:36.613 --> 00:11:38.273
find the kidnappers' whereabouts.

00:11:38.863 --> 00:11:41.283
It was clearly a large job, with

00:11:41.293 --> 00:11:43.923
multiple people involved in the planning

00:11:44.113 --> 00:11:45.793
and execution of the kidnapping.

00:11:46.583 --> 00:11:49.133
Moro had been snatched from

00:11:49.133 --> 00:11:50.263
the streets of the capital.

00:11:50.623 --> 00:11:52.713
This had been going on for almost

00:11:52.773 --> 00:11:55.673
two months, and someone, somewhere,

00:11:56.003 --> 00:11:57.153
must have heard something.

00:11:58.553 --> 00:12:00.613
The police looked for clues in

00:12:00.613 --> 00:12:02.663
Moro’s letters, thinking he might

00:12:02.673 --> 00:12:04.973
have left hidden secret messages

00:12:05.183 --> 00:12:07.273
beneath the innocent-looking words.

00:12:08.353 --> 00:12:10.223
Whatever tip the authorities

00:12:10.223 --> 00:12:12.023
followed, it led to nothing.

00:12:13.106 --> 00:12:16.356
And as the days went by, the so-called

00:12:16.736 --> 00:12:19.346
“People’s Trial” came to a close.

00:12:20.526 --> 00:12:23.286
In their ninth and final communication,

00:12:23.696 --> 00:12:25.536
the Red Brigades announced that

00:12:25.586 --> 00:12:27.956
Aldo Moro had been found guilty

00:12:28.346 --> 00:12:30.126
and would be sentenced accordingly.

00:12:31.016 --> 00:12:32.586
In other words, he was

00:12:32.586 --> 00:12:33.786
about to be executed.

00:12:35.116 --> 00:12:38.421
Still, the state remained resolute.

00:12:38.746 --> 00:12:39.406
It did nothing.

00:12:39.876 --> 00:12:42.346
Its policy was clear: we do

00:12:42.346 --> 00:12:44.906
not negotiate with terrorists.

00:12:46.556 --> 00:12:49.946
And on the 9th of May 1978,

00:12:50.576 --> 00:12:52.676
the waiting came to an end.

00:12:53.456 --> 00:12:56.026
Moro’s trusted assistant, Francesco

00:12:56.026 --> 00:12:59.486
Tritto, received a phone call from a man

00:12:59.486 --> 00:13:01.586
who said he was from The Red Brigades.

00:13:02.356 --> 00:13:04.736
Moro was dead, he told him.

00:13:05.446 --> 00:13:08.136
Go to via Caetani in central Rome.

00:13:08.636 --> 00:13:09.766
There’s a red Renault.

00:13:10.156 --> 00:13:11.536
Look in the boot.

00:13:12.116 --> 00:13:12.876
You’ll find him there.

00:13:13.968 --> 00:13:15.798
The police rushed to the scene.

00:13:16.718 --> 00:13:18.918
They opened the boot and found

00:13:18.918 --> 00:13:21.948
Moro’s lifeless body, still wearing

00:13:21.948 --> 00:13:23.808
the suit he had been kidnapped in.

00:13:25.218 --> 00:13:27.408
The location had been chosen with

00:13:27.438 --> 00:13:30.858
deliberate cruelty: halfway between

00:13:30.858 --> 00:13:32.678
the headquarters of the Christian

00:13:32.678 --> 00:13:35.308
Democrats and those of the Communist

00:13:35.308 --> 00:13:38.128
Party, as if to symbolise the death

00:13:38.458 --> 00:13:40.248
of Moro’s dream of compromise.

00:13:41.398 --> 00:13:43.588
The shock was immense.

00:13:44.038 --> 00:13:45.588
Leaders of all parties

00:13:45.618 --> 00:13:46.878
condemned the murder.

00:13:47.438 --> 00:13:50.108
Italians wept in the streets.

00:13:51.208 --> 00:13:53.128
There were offers of a state funeral,

00:13:53.538 --> 00:13:56.458
but in a very public statement against

00:13:56.458 --> 00:13:58.538
a country they felt had abandoned

00:13:58.558 --> 00:14:01.808
him, his family refused, instead

00:14:02.158 --> 00:14:04.758
opting for a private funeral, to

00:14:04.758 --> 00:14:07.018
which no politicians were invited.

00:14:08.285 --> 00:14:10.895
And there, the grief was mixed with

00:14:10.895 --> 00:14:14.145
fury; fury at the Red Brigades, fury

00:14:14.325 --> 00:14:16.495
at the state’s refusal to negotiate,

00:14:16.935 --> 00:14:19.025
fury at the sense that something

00:14:19.025 --> 00:14:21.735
essential had died along with him.

00:14:23.108 --> 00:14:25.978
And for the Red Brigades, even

00:14:25.978 --> 00:14:27.518
though they might have achieved their

00:14:27.538 --> 00:14:30.268
stated goal by putting Aldo Moro

00:14:30.268 --> 00:14:32.688
on trial and humiliating the state,

00:14:33.218 --> 00:14:36.228
this whole saga would be a disaster.

00:14:37.858 --> 00:14:40.818
After killing Moro, they lost all public

00:14:40.828 --> 00:14:43.788
sympathy, even among radical workers

00:14:43.788 --> 00:14:46.538
and students, people who may have shared

00:14:46.548 --> 00:14:49.668
some similar political ideologies but

00:14:49.988 --> 00:14:52.818
who saw kidnapping and murder as entirely

00:14:53.078 --> 00:14:56.468
beyond the pale, utterly unjustified.

00:14:57.538 --> 00:14:59.728
The communist party denounced them

00:14:59.818 --> 00:15:02.628
outright; the left turned its back.

00:15:03.418 --> 00:15:06.198
The state was galvanised to crush them,

00:15:06.638 --> 00:15:10.138
and within three years, 32 members

00:15:10.298 --> 00:15:12.378
of the Red Brigades, including most

00:15:12.378 --> 00:15:14.318
of its leadership, were convicted

00:15:14.558 --> 00:15:16.628
and sentenced to life imprisonment

00:15:16.868 --> 00:15:18.848
for their role in the Moro affair.

00:15:20.405 --> 00:15:22.715
And Aldo Moro’s dream of the

00:15:22.885 --> 00:15:25.075
“historic compromise”, well,

00:15:25.545 --> 00:15:27.325
without its key architect and

00:15:27.325 --> 00:15:29.565
proponent, it was out of the window.

00:15:30.935 --> 00:15:35.195
But not everyone lost out from the affair.

00:15:36.265 --> 00:15:38.725
For the Christian Democrats, especially

00:15:38.745 --> 00:15:41.005
the right of the party, it meant

00:15:41.245 --> 00:15:44.365
continuity, a continuation of the system

00:15:44.365 --> 00:15:46.455
that Moro had been pushing to change,

00:15:46.805 --> 00:15:49.265
as well as greater public support for a

00:15:49.345 --> 00:15:52.235
crackdown against left-wing extremism.

00:15:53.795 --> 00:15:56.915
This also played out nicely for Italy’s

00:15:56.925 --> 00:15:59.005
Western allies, who had been fearful

00:15:59.025 --> 00:16:00.855
of communists getting a seat at the

00:16:00.855 --> 00:16:03.675
table, as Moro had been proposing.

00:16:05.105 --> 00:16:08.615
And domestically, anyone who opposed

00:16:08.635 --> 00:16:11.595
communism probably also benefited,

00:16:12.078 --> 00:16:14.175
whether this was elements of Masonic

00:16:14.205 --> 00:16:17.685
Lodges such as the infamous P2 [P2

00:16:17.685 --> 00:16:19.785
in English], or even the mafia.

00:16:21.425 --> 00:16:24.725
And, like in Piazza Fontana and the

00:16:24.735 --> 00:16:26.795
Bologna bombing that we’ll talk about in

00:16:26.795 --> 00:16:30.245
the next episode, this has given rise to

00:16:30.245 --> 00:16:32.905
theories that the official explanation

00:16:33.335 --> 00:16:35.545
might not be telling the whole story.

00:16:37.115 --> 00:16:39.295
In the case of Aldo Moro, there

00:16:39.295 --> 00:16:41.825
are many things that don’t add up,

00:16:42.145 --> 00:16:45.125
and some that are just plain weird.

00:16:46.145 --> 00:16:48.975
There was a séance, of all things, a

00:16:48.975 --> 00:16:51.775
kind of spiritual meeting where people

00:16:51.805 --> 00:16:53.655
try to communicate with the dead.

00:16:54.635 --> 00:16:57.655
This was held by a group of professors

00:16:57.925 --> 00:16:59.955
at the University of Rome, who

00:17:00.045 --> 00:17:02.825
claimed to receive messages from

00:17:02.825 --> 00:17:05.265
the beyond about Moro’s location.

00:17:06.645 --> 00:17:09.815
Absurd as it sounds, their cryptic clues

00:17:10.025 --> 00:17:12.075
were actually passed to the police,

00:17:12.495 --> 00:17:15.605
and some of them eerily pointed to

00:17:15.605 --> 00:17:18.435
places connected with the kidnapping.

00:17:19.255 --> 00:17:21.125
So you either believe in the

00:17:21.125 --> 00:17:23.765
supernatural, or you believe that

00:17:23.775 --> 00:17:26.025
this was a way for someone to pass

00:17:26.065 --> 00:17:29.205
information “unofficially” to the police.

00:17:30.425 --> 00:17:33.285
And one of the people at this seance

00:17:33.585 --> 00:17:36.235
was Romano Prodi, a name you may

00:17:36.235 --> 00:17:38.135
remember because he has served

00:17:38.195 --> 00:17:40.635
twice as Italian Prime Minister,

00:17:41.135 --> 00:17:43.955
in the late 1990s and late 2000s.

00:17:45.055 --> 00:17:47.225
What’s more, there were reports of

00:17:47.245 --> 00:17:50.155
missed opportunities, bungled searches,

00:17:50.385 --> 00:17:52.545
and phone calls that were ignored.

00:17:53.715 --> 00:17:56.215
It would later turn out that Moro never

00:17:56.215 --> 00:17:59.355
left Rome, yet somehow the Italian

00:17:59.355 --> 00:18:01.185
police, with all their resources,

00:18:01.555 --> 00:18:04.005
never found him, even though they

00:18:04.005 --> 00:18:05.745
raided hundreds of apartments.

00:18:06.445 --> 00:18:08.225
How could the kidnappers have

00:18:08.225 --> 00:18:10.415
moved him around a city swarming

00:18:10.415 --> 00:18:12.355
with checkpoints and surveillance?

00:18:14.105 --> 00:18:15.985
And then there’s the international angle.

00:18:16.815 --> 00:18:19.225
Some accounts suggest that foreign

00:18:19.245 --> 00:18:22.375
intelligence agencies, the CIA, the

00:18:22.385 --> 00:18:25.715
KGB, and even the Stasi, all had

00:18:25.715 --> 00:18:27.695
their eyes on Italy at the time.

00:18:28.455 --> 00:18:30.365
A Communist party joining the

00:18:30.365 --> 00:18:31.985
government of a NATO country

00:18:32.095 --> 00:18:33.965
was unthinkable to Washington.

00:18:34.995 --> 00:18:37.005
To Moscow, the compromise

00:18:37.285 --> 00:18:38.365
looked like betrayal.

00:18:39.595 --> 00:18:41.525
Did these superpowers have an

00:18:41.535 --> 00:18:43.825
interest in seeing Moro silenced?

00:18:45.545 --> 00:18:47.385
There are no definitive answers.

00:18:47.765 --> 00:18:50.235
And that’s exactly the point.

00:18:50.895 --> 00:18:53.435
The kidnapping of Aldo Moro remains

00:18:53.435 --> 00:18:55.675
an open wound in Italy because the

00:18:55.675 --> 00:18:58.445
official story leaves too many gaps.

00:18:59.355 --> 00:19:01.755
When the state cannot, or will not,

00:19:02.055 --> 00:19:04.735
explain fully what happened, conspiracy

00:19:04.735 --> 00:19:07.415
theories rush in to fill the void.

00:19:07.955 --> 00:19:10.845
And to this day, the kidnapping and murder

00:19:10.975 --> 00:19:13.755
of Aldo Moro remain one of the darkest

00:19:13.755 --> 00:19:15.975
chapters in modern Italian history.

00:19:16.475 --> 00:19:17.885
Not just because of the

00:19:17.885 --> 00:19:19.725
violence, but because of the

00:19:19.765 --> 00:19:21.685
questions that still linger.

00:19:22.535 --> 00:19:24.115
Did the government really

00:19:24.115 --> 00:19:25.425
do all it could to save him?

00:19:26.076 --> 00:19:28.645
Did foreign powers play a hidden role?

00:19:29.155 --> 00:19:31.515
Was the state itself complicit

00:19:31.775 --> 00:19:33.785
in letting him die to prevent the

00:19:33.795 --> 00:19:35.445
Communists from entering power?

00:19:36.465 --> 00:19:38.195
In all likelihood, the full

00:19:38.195 --> 00:19:40.185
truth will never come to light.

00:19:40.725 --> 00:19:42.805
But what is certain is that

00:19:42.805 --> 00:19:45.065
Moro’s death marked something of a

00:19:45.165 --> 00:19:47.155
turning point in the Years of Lead.

00:19:48.485 --> 00:19:51.815
And just two years later, Italy would

00:19:51.825 --> 00:19:55.225
be shaken again by an atrocity deadlier

00:19:55.225 --> 00:19:57.245
than anything that had come before,

00:19:57.725 --> 00:20:00.265
the bombing of Bologna train station in

00:20:00.275 --> 00:20:03.285
1980, an attack that remains the worst

00:20:03.305 --> 00:20:05.645
act of terrorism in Italian history.

00:20:06.805 --> 00:20:08.775
And that, my friends, is what

00:20:08.775 --> 00:20:10.625
we’ll explore in the third and

00:20:10.625 --> 00:20:12.685
final part of this mini-series.

00:20:14.145 --> 00:20:16.085
OK, then, that is it for today's

00:20:16.085 --> 00:20:18.705
episode on the kidnapping of Aldo Moro.

00:20:19.105 --> 00:20:20.385
I hope it's been an interesting one

00:20:20.685 --> 00:20:22.305
and that you've learnt something new.

00:20:22.955 --> 00:20:24.465
As always, I would love to know

00:20:24.465 --> 00:20:25.955
what you thought of this episode.

00:20:26.235 --> 00:20:27.535
Italy is one of our most

00:20:27.605 --> 00:20:29.865
popular countries, and this

00:20:29.865 --> 00:20:31.505
was not even 50 years ago.

00:20:31.785 --> 00:20:34.245
So, for the Italians, or indeed

00:20:34.275 --> 00:20:36.135
anyone, who might remember this period.

00:20:36.485 --> 00:20:38.605
What are your memories of it from the

00:20:38.615 --> 00:20:41.615
time, and how do you remember it now,

00:20:41.895 --> 00:20:43.915
looking back on it five decades later?

00:20:44.445 --> 00:20:46.285
I would love to know, so let’s

00:20:46.285 --> 00:20:47.655
get this discussion started.

00:20:47.895 --> 00:20:48.995
You can head right into our

00:20:48.995 --> 00:20:50.595
community forum, which is at

00:20:50.595 --> 00:20:53.335
community.leonardoenglish.com and get

00:20:53.335 --> 00:20:55.535
chatting away to other curious minds.

00:20:56.275 --> 00:20:58.115
You've been listening to English Learning

00:20:58.115 --> 00:21:00.825
for Curious Minds by Leonardo English.

00:21:01.265 --> 00:21:03.845
I'm Alastair Budge, you stay safe, and

00:21:03.845 --> 00:21:05.985
I'll catch you in the next episode.
