Hello, hello, hello, and welcome

00:00:08.241 --> 00:00:10.011
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:10.011 --> 00:00:12.771
Minds, by Leonardo English, the show

00:00:12.781 --> 00:00:14.581
where you can listen to fascinating

00:00:14.581 --> 00:00:17.161
stories and learn weird and wonderful

00:00:17.171 --> 00:00:19.111
things about the world at the same

00:00:19.111 --> 00:00:20.811
time as improving your English.

00:00:21.251 --> 00:00:23.611
I'm Alastair Budge, and today

00:00:23.791 --> 00:00:25.361
we are going to be talking

00:00:25.581 --> 00:00:28.151
about the global housing crisis.

00:00:28.641 --> 00:00:30.951
All over the world, with very few

00:00:30.951 --> 00:00:33.581
exceptions, house prices have been

00:00:33.581 --> 00:00:36.561
rising, outstripping incomes, and making

00:00:36.571 --> 00:00:39.141
home ownership harder than ever before.

00:00:39.581 --> 00:00:42.551
So in this episode, we’ll be looking at

00:00:42.551 --> 00:00:44.901
what’s actually happening, what are some

00:00:44.901 --> 00:00:47.931
of the causes and effects of this, and

00:00:47.931 --> 00:00:50.791
what–if anything–can be done about it.

00:00:51.291 --> 00:00:53.311
I will warn you, this is quite a

00:00:53.321 --> 00:00:56.051
long episode, but it’s an important

00:00:56.291 --> 00:00:58.621
and complicated topic, and so I

00:00:58.621 --> 00:01:00.351
hope you will excuse this being

00:01:00.381 --> 00:01:01.961
somewhat longer than usual ones.

00:01:02.641 --> 00:01:05.091
But before we get right into this episode,

00:01:05.321 --> 00:01:07.421
let me briefly remind you that you can

00:01:07.421 --> 00:01:09.351

00:01:34.141 --> 00:01:36.361
step on your English learning journey,

the place to go is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:40.711 --> 00:01:43.031
OK then, let's not waste a

00:01:43.041 --> 00:01:45.587
minute and get right into it.

00:01:47.031 --> 00:01:48.861
In British English, we have an

00:01:48.861 --> 00:01:51.281
expression you might not have come

00:01:51.281 --> 00:01:54.541
across before: “safe as houses”.

00:01:54.921 --> 00:01:57.171
Something is “safe as houses”,

00:01:57.211 --> 00:01:59.541
or “as safe as houses”.

00:02:00.461 --> 00:02:02.601
It’s an unusual expression,

00:02:03.051 --> 00:02:03.861
on the one hand.

00:02:04.211 --> 00:02:06.371
Grammatically it's odd.

00:02:06.801 --> 00:02:10.791
It's 'safe as houses' [plural] even though

00:02:10.971 --> 00:02:13.001
you're describing something singular.

00:02:13.311 --> 00:02:16.291
You say 'something is as safe as

00:02:16.291 --> 00:02:19.831
houses,' not 'as safe as a house.'

00:02:21.081 --> 00:02:22.901
If you had to guess what it meant,

00:02:23.541 --> 00:02:26.121
I imagine you might think “very

00:02:26.121 --> 00:02:29.141
safe”, because a house is safe,

00:02:29.301 --> 00:02:31.601
with a door and a lock, and so on.

00:02:32.531 --> 00:02:34.941
That would be a perfectly reasonable

00:02:34.941 --> 00:02:37.191
guess, and it’s partially right.

00:02:38.001 --> 00:02:40.961
Safe as houses doesn’t just mean safe

00:02:41.261 --> 00:02:44.351
in a general sense, it typically means

00:02:44.541 --> 00:02:47.984
something is a safe and good investment.

00:02:48.851 --> 00:02:51.251
After all, you can see a house.

00:02:52.491 --> 00:02:53.571
Nobody can steal your

00:02:53.571 --> 00:02:54.951
house or take it from you.

00:02:55.441 --> 00:02:56.911
You can also live in it,

00:02:56.911 --> 00:02:58.291
which is something you can’t

00:02:58.301 --> 00:03:00.011
do with most investments.

00:03:00.761 --> 00:03:03.421
And if you are lucky enough to have

00:03:03.421 --> 00:03:05.771
some extra cash and are looking for

00:03:05.781 --> 00:03:07.651
a sensible investment opportunity,

00:03:08.171 --> 00:03:11.011
historically buying property and renting

00:03:11.011 --> 00:03:13.621
it out has been considered a good option.

00:03:15.001 --> 00:03:16.681
Of course this isn’t a

00:03:16.691 --> 00:03:18.661
uniquely British phenomenon.

00:03:19.181 --> 00:03:21.491
Investing in property is popular all

00:03:21.531 --> 00:03:23.901
over the world for similar reasons,

00:03:24.101 --> 00:03:25.601
with people in some countries

00:03:25.901 --> 00:03:28.171
tending to do it more so than others.

00:03:29.351 --> 00:03:32.871
And as you may know, in the UK house

00:03:32.871 --> 00:03:36.621
prices have continued to rise almost every

00:03:36.621 --> 00:03:39.061
year, for the best part of a century.

00:03:39.701 --> 00:03:43.331
Slowly but surely, up and up they went.

00:03:43.961 --> 00:03:47.031
In 1952, the average price of a house

00:03:47.051 --> 00:03:52.091
in the UK was £1,891, which is the

00:03:52.091 --> 00:03:55.051
equivalent of around £48,000 today.

00:03:55.741 --> 00:03:59.421
Last year, in 2025, the average

00:03:59.421 --> 00:04:05.061
house price was £271,188.

00:04:05.701 --> 00:04:08.421
And even in inflation-adjusted

00:04:08.501 --> 00:04:11.611
terms, house prices have increased

00:04:11.671 --> 00:04:14.471
by more than five and a half times.

00:04:15.161 --> 00:04:17.321
Now, the fact that the price has

00:04:17.321 --> 00:04:19.801
increased so drastically isn’t

00:04:19.841 --> 00:04:21.931
a terrible thing in itself.

00:04:22.401 --> 00:04:25.451
In fact, for several decades, from

00:04:25.451 --> 00:04:29.141
the 1950s to the mid-1990s, house

00:04:29.141 --> 00:04:31.511
prices increased very gradually

00:04:31.681 --> 00:04:33.491
every year, at the same rate,

00:04:33.711 --> 00:04:35.851
more or less, as average incomes.

00:04:36.261 --> 00:04:38.481
House prices went up, but so did

00:04:38.481 --> 00:04:41.511
salaries, so it all evened out.

00:04:42.201 --> 00:04:45.161
Being able to buy a home on one person’s

00:04:45.211 --> 00:04:47.791
regular salary was perfectly possible.

00:04:48.651 --> 00:04:50.921
But then, starting in the

00:04:50.931 --> 00:04:54.341
late 1990s, something…changed.

00:04:54.991 --> 00:04:57.141
Instead of going up slowly but

00:04:57.141 --> 00:04:59.571
surely, property prices in the

00:04:59.581 --> 00:05:02.261
UK started to increase steeply.

00:05:03.061 --> 00:05:04.581
And importantly, they

00:05:04.581 --> 00:05:06.361
started to significantly

00:05:06.611 --> 00:05:09.141
outstrip the growth in wages.

00:05:10.101 --> 00:05:13.201
In the 1950s, the average home cost

00:05:13.211 --> 00:05:16.401
the equivalent of 4 years of wages.

00:05:16.941 --> 00:05:20.041
In 2021, the average home in

00:05:20.051 --> 00:05:21.971
London cost the equivalent

00:05:22.091 --> 00:05:25.391
of almost 13 years of wages.

00:05:26.111 --> 00:05:29.281
And rent has increased at a similar pace.

00:05:29.721 --> 00:05:31.751
The average rent in the whole of

00:05:31.751 --> 00:05:35.451
the UK is £1,400 a month, while

00:05:35.451 --> 00:05:38.851
in London it’s a whopping £2,200.

00:05:39.621 --> 00:05:43.081
Now, as I’m sure you know, this is far

00:05:43.081 --> 00:05:45.541
from a uniquely British phenomenon, and

00:05:45.541 --> 00:05:48.311
the UK is not even the worst in terms of

00:05:48.311 --> 00:05:50.711
housing prices and housing affordability.

00:05:51.301 --> 00:05:53.521
In fact, in many countries the

00:05:53.521 --> 00:05:56.101
situation is even more extreme.

00:05:56.751 --> 00:06:00.131
Cities like Sydney, Toronto, Vancouver,

00:06:00.261 --> 00:06:02.961
Hong Kong, and even in parts of Europe

00:06:03.241 --> 00:06:05.651
have all seen similar — and in some cases

00:06:05.711 --> 00:06:08.701
even sharper — rises in house prices

00:06:08.821 --> 00:06:11.161
over roughly the same period of time.

00:06:12.171 --> 00:06:14.161
So, what’s going on?

00:06:14.701 --> 00:06:17.611
Why, almost the world over, has there

00:06:17.651 --> 00:06:20.221
been such a surge in property prices,

00:06:20.381 --> 00:06:23.311
where a roof over your head has gone

00:06:23.331 --> 00:06:24.921
from something most people could

00:06:24.921 --> 00:06:27.671
reasonably expect to afford to something

00:06:28.021 --> 00:06:30.411
that increasingly feels out of reach?

00:06:31.051 --> 00:06:33.411
Well, there are some unique factors

00:06:33.411 --> 00:06:35.761
that apply to specific areas, which

00:06:35.871 --> 00:06:38.321
we will go into later in the episode.

00:06:38.641 --> 00:06:40.841
But there are also some global

00:06:40.851 --> 00:06:43.071
forces, factors that affect

00:06:43.081 --> 00:06:45.054
the global property market.

00:06:45.781 --> 00:06:48.951
The first and most important shift

00:06:49.321 --> 00:06:51.691
was that buying a home gradually

00:06:51.921 --> 00:06:54.481
became less about income, and

00:06:54.491 --> 00:06:56.671
more about access to credit.

00:06:57.781 --> 00:07:00.571
For much of the twentieth century, if

00:07:00.571 --> 00:07:02.821
you wanted to buy a house, how much

00:07:02.821 --> 00:07:05.371
you earned placed a fairly strict

00:07:05.371 --> 00:07:07.271
limit on what you could afford.

00:07:08.291 --> 00:07:11.241
Mortgages were relatively conservative,

00:07:11.551 --> 00:07:14.641
deposits were large, interest rates were

00:07:14.661 --> 00:07:18.511
often in the double digits, and banks were

00:07:18.551 --> 00:07:20.951
cautious about how much they would lend.

00:07:22.161 --> 00:07:23.701
In other words, you couldn’t

00:07:23.701 --> 00:07:25.571
borrow very much money, and

00:07:25.601 --> 00:07:28.081
borrowing money was very expensive.

00:07:28.931 --> 00:07:31.991
But from the late 1990s onwards,

00:07:32.291 --> 00:07:35.341
borrowing became easier and cheaper.

00:07:36.111 --> 00:07:39.107
Interest rates fell, not just in the UK,

00:07:39.231 --> 00:07:40.961
but across much of the developed world.

00:07:41.561 --> 00:07:42.981
Monthly mortgage payments

00:07:43.191 --> 00:07:44.371
became more affordable.

00:07:44.751 --> 00:07:47.741
And banks became increasingly willing to

00:07:47.741 --> 00:07:50.611
lend larger multiples of people’s incomes.

00:07:51.401 --> 00:07:54.551
This had a powerful effect on prices.

00:07:54.801 --> 00:07:56.841
It pushed them up dramatically.

00:07:57.751 --> 00:08:00.701
Estate agents increasingly encouraged

00:08:00.731 --> 00:08:02.771
prospective buyers to think not

00:08:02.771 --> 00:08:05.061
about the sale price, but rather

00:08:05.301 --> 00:08:07.071
the monthly mortgage payments.

00:08:07.861 --> 00:08:10.461
After all, if your monthly payments are

00:08:10.461 --> 00:08:13.161
affordable, the price of your house is

00:08:13.161 --> 00:08:15.531
just a number; it doesn’t really matter.

00:08:16.141 --> 00:08:17.221
And anyway, it would

00:08:17.221 --> 00:08:18.901
almost certainly go up.

00:08:19.201 --> 00:08:19.961
They always did.

00:08:20.621 --> 00:08:22.611
As long as interest rates

00:08:22.771 --> 00:08:25.421
stayed low, house prices were

00:08:25.421 --> 00:08:27.051
allowed to keep climbing.

00:08:28.201 --> 00:08:31.001
And, like with anything, the more prices

00:08:31.001 --> 00:08:33.011
rose, the more attractive property

00:08:33.011 --> 00:08:35.421
became as an investment opportunity.

00:08:36.381 --> 00:08:38.091
For many years, it was very

00:08:38.091 --> 00:08:40.131
attractive, in the UK especially,

00:08:40.381 --> 00:08:42.371
which had all sorts of incentives

00:08:42.601 --> 00:08:44.911
encouraging people to become landlords.

00:08:45.831 --> 00:08:47.861
After all, the bank would only

00:08:47.861 --> 00:08:50.661
require a small deposit, a tenant’s

00:08:50.701 --> 00:08:52.881
monthly rent would more than cover

00:08:53.101 --> 00:08:55.001
the monthly mortgage costs, and

00:08:55.011 --> 00:08:56.981
the price would continue to rise.

00:08:58.321 --> 00:09:00.461
What this meant was that housing

00:09:00.731 --> 00:09:03.121
increasingly stopped being treated

00:09:03.431 --> 00:09:06.491
primarily as a place to live, and started

00:09:06.561 --> 00:09:09.071
being treated as a financial asset.

00:09:10.231 --> 00:09:12.121
Then, of course, came the

00:09:12.141 --> 00:09:15.231
Great Financial Crisis of 2008.

00:09:16.401 --> 00:09:19.381
This crisis, which began with risky

00:09:19.381 --> 00:09:20.931
mortgages in the United States,

00:09:21.281 --> 00:09:23.201
showed what could happen when

00:09:23.211 --> 00:09:25.311
housing prices became completely

00:09:25.321 --> 00:09:28.021
disconnected from economic fundamentals.

00:09:28.901 --> 00:09:30.791
As you'll know, when the bubble

00:09:30.827 --> 00:09:33.311
burst, millions of people lost their

00:09:33.321 --> 00:09:35.851
homes, banks collapsed, and the

00:09:35.851 --> 00:09:38.231
global economy went into freefall.

00:09:39.241 --> 00:09:40.787
You might think this would

00:09:40.787 --> 00:09:42.051
have taught everyone a lesson.

00:09:42.351 --> 00:09:43.581
That it might have led to a

00:09:43.581 --> 00:09:45.581
complete rethink of housing

00:09:45.791 --> 00:09:47.111
as an investment vehicle.

00:09:47.711 --> 00:09:50.481
But what actually happened was,

00:09:50.931 --> 00:09:52.511
in many ways, the opposite.

00:09:53.331 --> 00:09:55.431
Governments and central banks were

00:09:55.461 --> 00:09:58.311
absolutely terrified of another collapse.

00:09:58.741 --> 00:10:01.111
So instead of allowing prices to

00:10:01.111 --> 00:10:03.411
fall to more affordable levels,

00:10:03.631 --> 00:10:05.321
they did everything in their power

00:10:05.571 --> 00:10:07.951
to support the market and prevent

00:10:07.981 --> 00:10:09.891
prices from dropping too far.

00:10:10.671 --> 00:10:12.931
They pumped lots of money into the

00:10:12.951 --> 00:10:15.921
financial system, and kept interest rates

00:10:16.061 --> 00:10:18.761
extremely low, for a very long time.

00:10:19.481 --> 00:10:21.621
In some countries, rates stayed

00:10:21.661 --> 00:10:24.221
close to zero for more than a decade.

00:10:25.177 --> 00:10:27.007
The aim was to make borrowing

00:10:27.017 --> 00:10:28.837
cheap, encourage spending,

00:10:29.137 --> 00:10:30.917
and keep economies alive.

00:10:31.577 --> 00:10:34.007
And in many ways, it worked.

00:10:34.307 --> 00:10:35.887
The world bounced back.

00:10:36.467 --> 00:10:38.607
But there was a side effect.

00:10:38.977 --> 00:10:42.147
A huge inflow of capital into assets:

00:10:42.447 --> 00:10:45.937
stocks, bonds, and crucially, property.

00:10:46.817 --> 00:10:48.977
And this is where the idea of

00:10:48.977 --> 00:10:51.907
housing as a global market starts

00:10:51.907 --> 00:10:53.457
to make a little more sense.

00:10:54.697 --> 00:10:57.287
In the past, the price of a home was

00:10:57.297 --> 00:11:00.087
mostly determined by local factors:

00:11:00.437 --> 00:11:02.957
local wages, local demand, local

00:11:02.957 --> 00:11:05.287
supply, because the people buying

00:11:05.417 --> 00:11:07.577
and living in them would be locals.

00:11:08.137 --> 00:11:11.487
But increasingly, housing prices were

00:11:11.487 --> 00:11:13.507
being influenced by global money.

00:11:13.877 --> 00:11:15.517
Money looking for safety.

00:11:15.937 --> 00:11:17.907
Money looking for returns.

00:11:19.097 --> 00:11:21.687
And this money isn’t abstract.

00:11:21.787 --> 00:11:24.277
It comes from pension funds, insurance

00:11:24.307 --> 00:11:27.197
companies, investment firms, and wealthy

00:11:27.197 --> 00:11:29.307
individuals, all looking for places

00:11:29.487 --> 00:11:32.337
to park large sums of money in assets

00:11:32.567 --> 00:11:35.457
that feel stable and predictable.

00:11:37.037 --> 00:11:40.027
Compared to complex financial products,

00:11:40.177 --> 00:11:43.207
housing looks reassuringly simple.

00:11:43.697 --> 00:11:44.967
It exists physically.

00:11:45.127 --> 00:11:47.237
It generates income through rent.

00:11:47.667 --> 00:11:50.127
And governments have a strong incentive

00:11:50.317 --> 00:11:51.997
to stop its value from collapsing.

00:11:52.997 --> 00:11:55.767
And once housing becomes part of

00:11:55.767 --> 00:11:57.847
that global flow of capital, it

00:11:57.847 --> 00:12:00.577
stops behaving like an ordinary good.

00:12:01.507 --> 00:12:03.087
At that point, it doesn’t really

00:12:03.087 --> 00:12:04.627
matter whether a flat is in

00:12:04.907 --> 00:12:07.287
London, Lisbon, or Toronto.

00:12:07.737 --> 00:12:09.477
What matters is that it’s in

00:12:09.477 --> 00:12:11.467
a country with a stable legal

00:12:11.467 --> 00:12:13.827
system, strong property rights,

00:12:13.997 --> 00:12:15.897
and a reputation for safety.

00:12:16.687 --> 00:12:19.467
That’s why similar patterns started

00:12:19.467 --> 00:12:21.657
to appear in very different places;

00:12:22.367 --> 00:12:25.657
a fireman in Paris was now no longer

00:12:25.667 --> 00:12:27.687
bidding for a property against the

00:12:27.687 --> 00:12:29.767
local greengrocer, schoolteacher,

00:12:29.947 --> 00:12:32.287
and wedding photographer, but against

00:12:32.297 --> 00:12:34.987
sophisticated international investors.

00:12:35.737 --> 00:12:38.917
So, demand for housing soon started to

00:12:38.917 --> 00:12:42.027
significantly outstrip supply in most

00:12:42.027 --> 00:12:44.837
major cities, further pushing up prices.

00:12:45.617 --> 00:12:47.767
Now, the obvious question is,

00:12:48.207 --> 00:12:50.977
“if demand is so high, why don't

00:12:50.977 --> 00:12:52.617
we just build more houses?”

00:12:53.707 --> 00:12:55.097
This is where we need to

00:12:55.097 --> 00:12:56.587
talk about housing supply.

00:12:57.237 --> 00:12:59.487
Because alongside all these

00:12:59.497 --> 00:13:01.697
financial factors pushing up

00:13:01.747 --> 00:13:04.547
prices, there's also been a chronic

00:13:04.597 --> 00:13:06.987
failure to build enough housing

00:13:07.227 --> 00:13:09.087
where people actually want to live.

00:13:10.337 --> 00:13:13.327
In the UK, the planning system is

00:13:13.327 --> 00:13:16.607
notoriously complex and restrictive.

00:13:17.057 --> 00:13:18.777
Getting permission to build can

00:13:18.777 --> 00:13:21.637
take years, and even when permission

00:13:21.647 --> 00:13:24.707
is granted, local opposition often

00:13:24.717 --> 00:13:27.457
delays or blocks development entirely.

00:13:28.407 --> 00:13:30.387
There's actually an acronym for this:

00:13:30.817 --> 00:13:33.677
NIMBY, which stands for "Not In My

00:13:33.687 --> 00:13:36.307
Back Yard", and describes someone

00:13:36.487 --> 00:13:38.547
who opposes new construction in

00:13:38.547 --> 00:13:41.277
their area, worried it will change

00:13:41.297 --> 00:13:42.587
the character of the neighbourhood

00:13:42.797 --> 00:13:45.277
or reduce their own property values.

00:13:46.527 --> 00:13:47.697
And then there are the

00:13:47.757 --> 00:13:49.097
practical constraints.

00:13:49.897 --> 00:13:52.897
You can't build more land in central

00:13:52.897 --> 00:13:55.847
London, or San Francisco, or Hong Kong.

00:13:56.417 --> 00:13:58.647
These cities are hemmed in by

00:13:58.697 --> 00:14:01.197
geography, and the most desirable

00:14:01.197 --> 00:14:03.127
areas are already built up.

00:14:04.127 --> 00:14:06.597
Add to this rising construction costs,

00:14:06.787 --> 00:14:09.297
labour shortages, and the fact that

00:14:09.307 --> 00:14:11.777
developers sometimes hold onto land

00:14:12.087 --> 00:14:14.037
rather than building on it—hoping

00:14:14.227 --> 00:14:16.617
values will increase even further—and

00:14:16.897 --> 00:14:19.167
you have a situation where supply

00:14:19.417 --> 00:14:21.847
simply can't keep up with demand.

00:14:22.627 --> 00:14:25.847
So even if the money side of things were

00:14:25.847 --> 00:14:28.507
sorted out, we'd still have a fundamental

00:14:28.507 --> 00:14:30.907
shortage of homes in the places

00:14:30.907 --> 00:14:32.767
where people actually want  to live.

00:14:34.047 --> 00:14:36.707
And demand keeps growing.

00:14:37.067 --> 00:14:39.027
Not just from population growth,

00:14:39.207 --> 00:14:41.397
but from changing demographics.

00:14:41.837 --> 00:14:43.557
People are living longer.

00:14:44.017 --> 00:14:45.917
More people are living alone.

00:14:47.097 --> 00:14:48.807
In much of the developed world,

00:14:49.047 --> 00:14:51.497
the average household size has been

00:14:51.497 --> 00:14:53.777
shrinking for decades, which means

00:14:54.067 --> 00:14:56.077
you need more units of housing

00:14:56.367 --> 00:14:57.677
for the same number of people.

00:14:58.470 --> 00:15:00.738
Add to this an increasing number

00:15:00.738 --> 00:15:02.788
of people, both domestically and

00:15:02.808 --> 00:15:04.788
internationally, migrating into

00:15:04.788 --> 00:15:07.368
cities, and you have even more

00:15:07.368 --> 00:15:09.218
pressure on the housing supply.

00:15:10.548 --> 00:15:12.628
All these factors mean that even

00:15:12.638 --> 00:15:14.898
maintaining current affordability

00:15:14.908 --> 00:15:16.908
would require building significantly

00:15:16.938 --> 00:15:18.888
more homes than we currently do.

00:15:19.618 --> 00:15:23.328
So, prices are almost guaranteed to rise.

00:15:24.198 --> 00:15:27.758
This isn’t just speculation or financial

00:15:27.778 --> 00:15:30.358
engineering, it’s basic arithmetic.

00:15:30.758 --> 00:15:33.058
More people competing for the same

00:15:33.058 --> 00:15:36.568
number of homes pushes up both rents and

00:15:36.588 --> 00:15:39.658
prices, regardless of how sensible or

00:15:39.768 --> 00:15:42.168
well-intentioned housing policy might be.

00:15:43.298 --> 00:15:44.458
And there is more.

00:15:44.938 --> 00:15:46.488
Just when it seemed like low

00:15:46.488 --> 00:15:47.958
interest rates might last

00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:50.228
forever, everything changed again.

00:15:51.098 --> 00:15:54.388
In 2022, inflation came roaring back.

00:15:54.898 --> 00:15:57.218
Central banks, which had spent over

00:15:57.218 --> 00:15:59.668
a decade keeping rates at historic

00:15:59.678 --> 00:16:02.478
lows, suddenly had to do a u-turn.

00:16:03.288 --> 00:16:05.338
In a matter of months, interest

00:16:05.338 --> 00:16:08.088
rates went from near zero to

00:16:08.088 --> 00:16:10.278
levels not seen in over a decade.

00:16:11.358 --> 00:16:13.438
In the UK, the base rate

00:16:13.588 --> 00:16:17.138
went from 0.1% to 5%.

00:16:17.808 --> 00:16:18.808
In the United States,

00:16:19.098 --> 00:16:21.158
rates rose even faster.

00:16:21.978 --> 00:16:22.958
For anyone with a

00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:25.358
mortgage, this was a shock.

00:16:25.828 --> 00:16:27.398
If your rate wasn’t fixed,

00:16:27.648 --> 00:16:29.568
your monthly payments soared.

00:16:30.218 --> 00:16:31.628
People who had borrowed the

00:16:31.638 --> 00:16:33.718
maximum amount when rates were

00:16:34.045 --> 00:16:36.658
2% suddenly found themselves

00:16:36.658 --> 00:16:38.748
paying twice as much each month.

00:16:39.738 --> 00:16:41.348
You might have thought this would

00:16:41.348 --> 00:16:43.988
have led to a fall in house prices,

00:16:44.188 --> 00:16:45.978
as people wouldn’t have been

00:16:45.978 --> 00:16:47.618
able to borrow as much as before.

00:16:48.228 --> 00:16:50.668
But here's the thing: house

00:16:50.668 --> 00:16:52.488
prices didn't collapse.

00:16:53.018 --> 00:16:55.798
They did fall slightly in some areas,

00:16:55.948 --> 00:16:58.378
and sales slowed down dramatically.

00:16:58.998 --> 00:17:02.098
But prices remained stubbornly high.

00:17:03.158 --> 00:17:03.618
Why?

00:17:04.208 --> 00:17:06.468
Well, because many people who already

00:17:06.528 --> 00:17:08.838
owned homes simply stayed put.

00:17:09.778 --> 00:17:11.438
If you had a cheap mortgage

00:17:11.678 --> 00:17:14.358
locked in, selling rarely made

00:17:14.358 --> 00:17:16.578
sense — because wherever you moved

00:17:16.588 --> 00:17:19.008
next would almost certainly come

00:17:19.008 --> 00:17:20.718
with a much more expensive loan.

00:17:21.968 --> 00:17:24.728
This created a kind of gridlock.

00:17:25.118 --> 00:17:27.608
Not enough homes for sale, still too

00:17:27.608 --> 00:17:29.358
expensive for first-time buyers to

00:17:29.358 --> 00:17:32.658
afford, but with even higher monthly

00:17:32.658 --> 00:17:34.958
costs due to expensive mortgages.

00:17:35.728 --> 00:17:37.268
In other words, the problem

00:17:37.438 --> 00:17:39.128
got worse, not better.

00:17:40.218 --> 00:17:43.348
So by this point, housing is being

00:17:43.438 --> 00:17:46.248
pulled in several directions at once:

00:17:46.858 --> 00:17:50.118
cheap money pushing prices up, global

00:17:50.118 --> 00:17:53.488
capital treating homes as assets, more

00:17:53.488 --> 00:17:55.968
people competing for housing in the same

00:17:55.978 --> 00:17:59.358
cities, and a system that struggles to

00:17:59.368 --> 00:18:01.578
build enough homes where they’re needed.

00:18:02.778 --> 00:18:06.388
And these are often exacerbated, made

00:18:06.388 --> 00:18:09.328
worse, by specific local conditions,

00:18:09.578 --> 00:18:11.878
so let’s talk about some of those now.

00:18:12.738 --> 00:18:15.348
Particularly in Europe, and in almost

00:18:15.388 --> 00:18:19.388
any reasonably sized city, an oft-cited

00:18:19.518 --> 00:18:23.078
culprit is short-term rentals, and one

00:18:23.078 --> 00:18:25.818
name in particular coming to mind: Airbnb.

00:18:27.018 --> 00:18:30.038
Landlords were choosing not to rent out

00:18:30.038 --> 00:18:32.318
their apartments long-term to locals,

00:18:32.438 --> 00:18:35.588
but to tourists on a short-term basis.

00:18:36.568 --> 00:18:38.918
The economic rationale for this

00:18:39.278 --> 00:18:41.578
is pretty obvious; a landlord can

00:18:41.578 --> 00:18:43.608
typically make much more money.

00:18:44.278 --> 00:18:46.828
But the effect on the local property

00:18:46.828 --> 00:18:49.648
market, as no doubt many of you will

00:18:49.648 --> 00:18:52.168
know all too well, is that it has

00:18:52.168 --> 00:18:54.518
reduced the supply of available housing

00:18:54.758 --> 00:18:57.348
for locals and significantly pushed

00:18:57.388 --> 00:19:01.118
up prices, both to buy and to rent.

00:19:02.258 --> 00:19:05.138
In Madrid and Barcelona, for example,

00:19:05.288 --> 00:19:08.138
over the past decade, rents have risen

00:19:08.378 --> 00:19:12.918
by an average of 60% and prices by 90%.

00:19:13.868 --> 00:19:15.788
And then there are the countries

00:19:15.968 --> 00:19:18.298
which courted wealthy foreigners with

00:19:18.308 --> 00:19:21.028
citizenship or tax incentives on the

00:19:21.028 --> 00:19:23.318
condition that they invested in property.

00:19:24.028 --> 00:19:27.498
In Malta, the tiny Mediterranean island

00:19:27.678 --> 00:19:30.288
where I used to live, citizenship was

00:19:30.308 --> 00:19:32.238
given to foreigners on the condition

00:19:32.444 --> 00:19:34.594
they bought property over a certain

00:19:34.594 --> 00:19:37.214
value, thereby reducing the housing

00:19:37.214 --> 00:19:40.194
supply for locals and pushing up prices

00:19:40.964 --> 00:19:43.374
. On the other side of Europe, Portugal

00:19:43.634 --> 00:19:45.914
had a similar scheme which offered

00:19:45.924 --> 00:19:47.934
residency to people investing

00:19:48.074 --> 00:19:49.524
in the local property market.

00:19:50.554 --> 00:19:53.554
In both of these cases, these policies

00:19:53.824 --> 00:19:56.134
successfully attracted lots of foreign

00:19:56.134 --> 00:19:57.764
money that would otherwise not have

00:19:57.774 --> 00:20:00.834
come, but it also helped push up

00:20:00.834 --> 00:20:03.444
prices to unprecedented levels.

00:20:04.514 --> 00:20:07.294
In Malta, property prices have

00:20:07.374 --> 00:20:09.164
doubled in the past decade.

00:20:09.714 --> 00:20:11.214
The average asking price in

00:20:11.214 --> 00:20:15.294
Malta is €414,000, yet the

00:20:15.294 --> 00:20:18.344
average salary is under €25,000.

00:20:19.264 --> 00:20:22.194
And it’s a similar situation in Portugal.

00:20:23.324 --> 00:20:25.534
In places like this, home ownership

00:20:25.544 --> 00:20:27.824
for anyone without family help

00:20:28.074 --> 00:20:30.044
is now something of a pipe dream.

00:20:31.264 --> 00:20:33.564
And this brings us to one of the

00:20:33.564 --> 00:20:36.604
most insidious effects: housing

00:20:36.604 --> 00:20:38.744
wealth is becoming hereditary.

00:20:40.044 --> 00:20:42.814
Increasingly, the only way young people

00:20:42.824 --> 00:20:45.334
can afford to buy is with help from

00:20:45.334 --> 00:20:48.254
parents - money for a deposit, co-signing

00:20:48.254 --> 00:20:50.954
mortgages, sometimes buying outright.

00:20:51.734 --> 00:20:53.534
If your parents own property,

00:20:53.954 --> 00:20:55.464
you might still get on the

00:20:55.464 --> 00:20:57.334
ladder, as the expression goes.

00:20:58.124 --> 00:21:00.014
If they don't, you're locked out,

00:21:00.374 --> 00:21:02.314
regardless of how hard you work.

00:21:03.174 --> 00:21:06.324
It means your ability to own a home

00:21:06.594 --> 00:21:09.534
depends less on your income than on

00:21:09.534 --> 00:21:11.274
whether you were lucky enough to have

00:21:11.304 --> 00:21:13.274
parents who bought property decades

00:21:13.274 --> 00:21:15.114
ago when it was still affordable.

00:21:16.204 --> 00:21:18.894
So this is the picture so far.

00:21:19.274 --> 00:21:22.374
Global forces push prices up everywhere.

00:21:22.804 --> 00:21:24.804
Local factors make the problem

00:21:24.804 --> 00:21:26.534
worse in certain places.

00:21:27.254 --> 00:21:30.614
And once prices reach a certain level,

00:21:30.984 --> 00:21:33.524
you get the situation that exists in many

00:21:33.524 --> 00:21:36.164
towns and cities all over the world today.

00:21:36.884 --> 00:21:40.144
Whether it’s paying sky-high rent or not

00:21:40.154 --> 00:21:42.284
being able to afford a deposit for your

00:21:42.284 --> 00:21:45.534
first home, just having your own roof over

00:21:45.534 --> 00:21:48.184
your head is more expensive than ever.

00:21:49.184 --> 00:21:51.664
So, this brings us to the

00:21:51.704 --> 00:21:53.094
trickiest part of the story.

00:21:53.754 --> 00:21:56.978
What, if anything can be done about it?

00:21:57.924 --> 00:21:59.834
It’s a problem that lots of people

00:21:59.844 --> 00:22:02.154
like to see easy solutions to.

00:22:02.734 --> 00:22:05.734
Build more homes, control rents, tax

00:22:05.764 --> 00:22:08.674
speculation, restrict short-term rentals,

00:22:08.894 --> 00:22:11.674
and stop prices from rising so fast.

00:22:13.054 --> 00:22:15.924
The reality is that all of these solutions

00:22:16.314 --> 00:22:18.514
come with their own share of problems.

00:22:19.084 --> 00:22:22.254
Building takes time, and in many

00:22:22.254 --> 00:22:25.024
countries–especially in the UK–it

00:22:25.384 --> 00:22:27.184
is fraught with regulations.

00:22:27.844 --> 00:22:30.494
Removing planning constraints sounds

00:22:30.724 --> 00:22:33.854
simple, but in practice it rarely is.

00:22:34.594 --> 00:22:36.254
Rent control is one of the

00:22:36.254 --> 00:22:38.024
most debated solutions.

00:22:38.704 --> 00:22:42.834
The idea is simple: cap how much landlords

00:22:42.834 --> 00:22:45.024
can increase rent each year, making

00:22:45.024 --> 00:22:47.204
housing more affordable for tenants.

00:22:48.044 --> 00:22:51.114
But in practice, it's complicated.

00:22:51.714 --> 00:22:54.404
Economists often point to cities like

00:22:54.584 --> 00:22:57.564
San Francisco or Stockholm, where strict

00:22:57.584 --> 00:23:00.774
rent control led to some landlords taking

00:23:00.774 --> 00:23:02.944
properties off the rental market entirely,

00:23:03.234 --> 00:23:05.484
either selling them or leaving them empty.

00:23:06.634 --> 00:23:10.094
This creates a paradox: by trying to make

00:23:10.094 --> 00:23:13.454
rent cheaper for some, it often makes it

00:23:13.504 --> 00:23:16.082
harder for others to find a home at all.

00:23:17.304 --> 00:23:19.754
That said, some cities have

00:23:19.754 --> 00:23:21.574
found some middle ground.

00:23:21.984 --> 00:23:24.874
Berlin tried strict rent controls,

00:23:25.024 --> 00:23:26.724
had to partially reverse them,

00:23:27.054 --> 00:23:29.094
but maintained some protections.

00:23:29.634 --> 00:23:31.884
The key seems to be balancing

00:23:31.954 --> 00:23:34.144
tenant protection with incentives

00:23:34.144 --> 00:23:35.948
to keep landlords in the market.

00:23:36.444 --> 00:23:38.314
It's not a silver bullet, but

00:23:38.534 --> 00:23:40.334
it's not entirely useless either.

00:23:41.484 --> 00:23:43.604
Restricting short-term rentals is

00:23:43.604 --> 00:23:46.074
something many cities have now started

00:23:46.094 --> 00:23:49.794
to do, with some success, but there are

00:23:49.794 --> 00:23:51.884
question marks about how deep an effect

00:23:51.904 --> 00:23:54.024
this will have on revenue from tourism.

00:23:55.054 --> 00:23:57.574
Taxing speculation is a nice idea

00:23:57.574 --> 00:24:00.324
in theory, but it quickly comes up

00:24:00.484 --> 00:24:02.994
against another uncomfortable reality:

00:24:03.904 --> 00:24:06.434
homeowners, who in many countries

00:24:06.604 --> 00:24:08.774
make up a majority of the voting

00:24:08.774 --> 00:24:11.394
population, have a vested interest

00:24:11.584 --> 00:24:15.014
in prices not coming down, especially

00:24:15.214 --> 00:24:17.474
if they took on a large mortgage.

00:24:18.584 --> 00:24:20.474
For millions of people, their

00:24:20.484 --> 00:24:22.844
home isn’t just somewhere to live.

00:24:23.394 --> 00:24:24.788
It’s their main asset.

00:24:25.124 --> 00:24:26.984
A large part of their retirement plan.

00:24:27.494 --> 00:24:28.934
Their financial safety net.

00:24:29.834 --> 00:24:33.684
So when house prices rise, homeowners

00:24:33.984 --> 00:24:36.334
feel richer and more secure.

00:24:37.064 --> 00:24:39.794
But when prices fall — or even stop

00:24:39.814 --> 00:24:43.344
rising — the same group feels threatened.

00:24:44.144 --> 00:24:46.484
So, governments face a dilemma.

00:24:47.194 --> 00:24:49.744
On the one hand, high house prices

00:24:50.024 --> 00:24:52.124
lock younger people out of home

00:24:52.124 --> 00:24:54.264
ownership, increase inequality,

00:24:54.514 --> 00:24:56.284
and put pressure on rents.

00:24:57.124 --> 00:24:59.624
On the other hand, falling house prices

00:24:59.834 --> 00:25:02.564
risk angering existing homeowners and

00:25:02.564 --> 00:25:05.154
losing voters, destabilising banks,

00:25:05.544 --> 00:25:08.204
and triggering wider economic problems.

00:25:08.974 --> 00:25:12.364
So instead of dramatic reform, what

00:25:12.364 --> 00:25:15.314
we often see are small, cautious

00:25:15.374 --> 00:25:17.664
adjustments, adjustments that don’t

00:25:17.724 --> 00:25:20.344
always have the intended consequences.

00:25:20.974 --> 00:25:23.394
Governments announce ambitious plans

00:25:23.604 --> 00:25:25.784
to build more homes, like the new

00:25:25.784 --> 00:25:27.374
Labour government did in the UK,

00:25:27.734 --> 00:25:30.334
but planning slows down everything,

00:25:30.624 --> 00:25:33.064
and they quickly miss their targets.

00:25:33.564 --> 00:25:35.294
They launch initiatives to help

00:25:35.304 --> 00:25:37.394
first-time buyers with interest-free

00:25:37.394 --> 00:25:40.344
loans, but these often end up pushing

00:25:40.344 --> 00:25:42.754
prices higher by increasing demand.

00:25:43.334 --> 00:25:45.534
They talk about controlling rents, but

00:25:45.894 --> 00:25:47.904
make promises to potential investors

00:25:48.134 --> 00:25:50.174
that their rights will also be protected.

00:25:50.734 --> 00:25:52.514
They make pledges to crack down on

00:25:52.544 --> 00:25:55.724
Airbnb, but all that happens is the

00:25:55.724 --> 00:25:58.454
implementation of token "tourist taxes".

00:25:59.664 --> 00:26:01.784
And then there’s the issue of timing.

00:26:02.744 --> 00:26:05.824
Even if a government decides today to

00:26:05.824 --> 00:26:08.134
build significantly more housing, the

00:26:08.134 --> 00:26:10.654
effects won’t be felt for several years.

00:26:11.184 --> 00:26:13.254
Planning, the actual construction,

00:26:13.644 --> 00:26:14.634
building in places where

00:26:14.634 --> 00:26:16.094
people actually want to live.

00:26:16.584 --> 00:26:18.094
That all takes time.

00:26:18.994 --> 00:26:21.234
So where does that leave us?

00:26:21.774 --> 00:26:23.854
Can house prices keep rising

00:26:23.854 --> 00:26:25.774
faster than incomes indefinitely?

00:26:26.624 --> 00:26:29.164
The optimistic view is that they can't.

00:26:29.574 --> 00:26:32.834
At some point, prices must correct,

00:26:33.214 --> 00:26:35.254
either through a crash or through

00:26:35.254 --> 00:26:36.864
a long period of stagnation

00:26:37.074 --> 00:26:39.364
while wages gradually catch up.

00:26:40.194 --> 00:26:42.834
The pessimistic view is that we're not

00:26:42.864 --> 00:26:45.484
in a traditional bubble waiting to pop.

00:26:46.274 --> 00:26:49.764
This is, as they say, a new equilibrium.

00:26:50.444 --> 00:26:52.624
As long as housing is seen as one of

00:26:52.624 --> 00:26:55.364
the safest places to park wealth, as

00:26:55.364 --> 00:26:57.314
long as there's more capital looking

00:26:57.314 --> 00:26:59.364
for safe returns than there are good

00:26:59.404 --> 00:27:01.534
investment opportunities, as long

00:27:01.534 --> 00:27:03.714
as people continue to move to towns

00:27:03.714 --> 00:27:06.234
and cities, and as long as we don't

00:27:06.274 --> 00:27:08.274
build enough homes in desirable

00:27:08.274 --> 00:27:11.344
locations, prices will keep climbing.

00:27:12.364 --> 00:27:14.874
The truth is probably somewhere in

00:27:14.874 --> 00:27:17.494
between, and will vary by location.

00:27:17.964 --> 00:27:20.174
Some markets may see corrections.

00:27:20.564 --> 00:27:22.084
Others may plateau, or

00:27:22.084 --> 00:27:23.444
even continue to rise.

00:27:24.274 --> 00:27:26.354
Unfortunately, it seems that the

00:27:26.364 --> 00:27:28.834
fundamental tension between housing

00:27:29.124 --> 00:27:32.084
as a human necessity and housing as

00:27:32.084 --> 00:27:34.744
a financial asset is here to stay.

00:27:36.164 --> 00:27:38.434
OK, then, that is it for today's

00:27:38.454 --> 00:27:41.324
episode on the global property crisis.

00:27:41.654 --> 00:27:43.264
As always, I would love to know

00:27:43.264 --> 00:27:44.734
what you thought of this episode.

00:27:45.054 --> 00:27:46.404
How have property prices

00:27:46.404 --> 00:27:47.854
changed in your city?

00:27:48.204 --> 00:27:51.084
How has this affected your life, and

00:27:51.084 --> 00:27:53.294
what do you think can be done about it?

00:27:53.634 --> 00:27:55.254
Let me know in the comments below,
