Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo

00:00:11.211 --> 00:00:15.981
English, the show where you can listen to fascinating stories and learn weird

00:00:16.021 --> 00:00:20.461
and wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.031 --> 00:00:25.181
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is part two of our three-part

00:00:25.181 --> 00:00:28.832
mini-series on the loose theme of the Ottoman Empire.

00:00:29.332 --> 00:00:33.317
In part one, we started at the end, with the life of Mustafa

00:00:33.317 --> 00:00:36.792
Kemal Atatürk and the creation of the modern Turkish state.

00:00:37.202 --> 00:00:40.652
In part three, our next episode, we are going to talk about

00:00:40.662 --> 00:00:44.312
the very specific case of the divided island of Cyprus.

00:00:44.952 --> 00:00:50.962
And in today’s episode, part two, we are going to talk about a man called Ali Pasha.

00:00:51.672 --> 00:00:58.292
To some, he was a fearless and brave leader, to others, he was a cruel, sadistic despot.

00:00:58.682 --> 00:01:03.252
He was nothing if not fascinating, and outside a small corner

00:01:03.272 --> 00:01:07.112
of Europe, the story of his life is not particularly well-known.

00:01:07.582 --> 00:01:11.682
So, let’s not waste a minute and get right into it.

00:01:13.492 --> 00:01:19.143
One of the consequences of the mass adoption of social media and the consequent proliferation

00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:26.553
of “influencers” and “influencer culture” is that a “hidden gem” doesn’t stay hidden for long.

00:01:27.263 --> 00:01:33.403
Whether it’s a spot of beauty, a quaint cafe, or a new restaurant, no matter

00:01:33.603 --> 00:01:39.023
how hidden and unknown it is to the outside world, someone will inevitably

00:01:39.023 --> 00:01:44.563
come along and feel compelled to post about it on Instagram or TikTok.

00:01:45.293 --> 00:01:50.013
Flocks of people arrive, wanting to see what all the fuss is about.

00:01:50.663 --> 00:01:54.443
And before long, it isn’t so secret anymore.

00:01:55.363 --> 00:02:00.973
This might seem like a uniquely modern phenomenon, and of course, the technological

00:02:01.003 --> 00:02:05.593
element means that the speed at which information can spread is much faster.

00:02:06.153 --> 00:02:08.993
But, it is not completely new.

00:02:09.933 --> 00:02:14.513
And indeed, the protagonist of today’s episode, a man born in

00:02:14.513 --> 00:02:20.323
1740, was the subject of perhaps the first modern influencer.

00:02:21.113 --> 00:02:26.563
For in 1809, Lord Byron, the famous English author and

00:02:26.603 --> 00:02:31.653
poet, arrived at the town of Ioannina in modern-day Greece.

00:02:32.763 --> 00:02:38.793
Until then, it was practically unknown to most Europeans and was far off the tourist

00:02:38.803 --> 00:02:44.603
trail, the route followed by young British aristocrats as part of their “Grand Tour”.

00:02:45.473 --> 00:02:49.783
By the way, as a quick aside, we have episodes about Lord Byron

00:02:49.873 --> 00:02:55.013
and The Grand Tour, those are episode number 244 and episode number

00:02:55.013 --> 00:02:59.193
156, if you would like to learn more about either of those subjects.

00:02:59.773 --> 00:03:01.823
Anyway, back to our story.

00:03:02.603 --> 00:03:09.853
Byron was impressed with what he saw, and in particular with the man he met: the Ottoman

00:03:09.903 --> 00:03:16.593
governor of Ioannina, a powerful and semi-independent figure in the Balkans, Ali Pasha.

00:03:17.933 --> 00:03:21.573
He reported back that he found, and I’m quoting directly,

00:03:22.113 --> 00:03:26.843
"a man of first abilities who governs the whole of Albania".

00:03:27.793 --> 00:03:30.863
First, in this sense, means “very high quality”.

00:03:31.963 --> 00:03:36.493
When these words were published, in his work Childe Harold's Pilgrimage,

00:03:36.693 --> 00:03:42.273
it caused quite a stir and firmly put Ali Pasha and his court on

00:03:42.273 --> 00:03:46.693
the map and on the young English aristocrat’s “must visit” list.

00:03:47.653 --> 00:03:53.423
Indeed, according to the author of the definitive biography of Ali Pasha, you can divide

00:03:53.443 --> 00:04:00.473
visitors to his court into two categories: before Lord Byron and after Lord Byron.

00:04:01.863 --> 00:04:07.263
Perhaps like some unsuspecting coffee shop owner who has unexpectedly “gone

00:04:07.273 --> 00:04:12.873
viral” after decades just minding their own business, Ali Pasha found himself

00:04:12.893 --> 00:04:18.353
to be the centre of attention, visited by adoring young men, featuring in

00:04:18.353 --> 00:04:23.483
the seminal works of French authors, and to be given a new lease of life.

00:04:24.293 --> 00:04:29.283
That was, I should say, until he was betrayed, shot, and his head placed

00:04:29.303 --> 00:04:33.633
on a silver platter and presented to the Ottoman Sultan in Constantinople.

00:04:34.303 --> 00:04:39.773
Now, I wanted to share this story because it is full of twists and turns,

00:04:40.073 --> 00:04:45.773
and gives you some insight into the mechanisms of the late Ottoman Empire.

00:04:46.883 --> 00:04:52.473
First, let’s paint a picture of what was going on in the time of Ali Pasha.

00:04:53.523 --> 00:04:58.463
He was born in 1740 in what is today Albania.

00:04:59.463 --> 00:05:04.253
Albania, as a quick geographical reminder for those of you who might not be so familiar

00:05:04.253 --> 00:05:10.363
with the Balkans and that area of Europe, is a country on the Eastern Adriatic coast.

00:05:11.023 --> 00:05:14.883
You have Greece, then above that, on the west coast, there’s

00:05:14.883 --> 00:05:18.113
Albania, and if you keep going you get to Montenegro.

00:05:18.793 --> 00:05:25.743
But back then, and indeed for the duration of the life of Ali Pasha, there was no

00:05:26.003 --> 00:05:31.853
nation-state of Greece, no nation-state of Albania or any of the modern Balkan countries.

00:05:32.943 --> 00:05:38.803
These all formed part of the Ottoman Empire, the vast area of land that

00:05:38.803 --> 00:05:43.683
covered not just the Balkans but much of the Middle East and North Africa.

00:05:44.643 --> 00:05:48.433
Now, although the Ottoman Empire was vast, it was not

00:05:48.483 --> 00:05:52.383
a monolithic entity where power was neatly centralised.

00:05:53.223 --> 00:05:57.933
On paper, everything flowed from the Ottoman Sultan in Constantinople.

00:05:58.263 --> 00:06:02.413
Every governor, every military commander, every official was

00:06:02.443 --> 00:06:07.584
appointed in his name, and all authority ultimately belonged to him.

00:06:08.264 --> 00:06:12.714
But in reality, the empire functioned quite differently.

00:06:13.754 --> 00:06:20.474
In practice, local rulers, regional governors, and powerful families often operated with

00:06:20.474 --> 00:06:27.094
a significant degree of autonomy, especially in far-flung provinces like the Balkans.

00:06:28.044 --> 00:06:33.444
The further you got from Constantinople, the more power was decentralised.

00:06:34.344 --> 00:06:40.454
And nowhere was this more evident than in the case of Ali Pasha of Ioannina.

00:06:41.504 --> 00:06:45.154
He was born into a minor noble family at a time of

00:06:45.184 --> 00:06:48.304
instability and constant regional power struggles.

00:06:49.134 --> 00:06:55.704
His father was a local Ottoman landholder, but he was assassinated when Ali was still a child.

00:06:56.364 --> 00:07:01.204
His family lost its status, and the young Ali grew up

00:07:01.394 --> 00:07:05.504
in an environment of revenge, survival, and ambition.

00:07:06.724 --> 00:07:12.914
It is said that his mother swore vengeance for her husband’s murder and instilled in her son

00:07:13.264 --> 00:07:20.754
a deep sense of ruthlessness—the belief that power was something to be seized, not inherited.

00:07:21.694 --> 00:07:23.864
And seize it he did.

00:07:24.744 --> 00:07:29.674
Ali Pasha’s early years are somewhat murky, but by his

00:07:29.694 --> 00:07:33.704
twenties, he had become a feared and respected military leader.

00:07:34.294 --> 00:07:38.464
He built a reputation as a bandit chieftain, raiding

00:07:38.464 --> 00:07:42.674
rival clans and intimidating his way into regional power.

00:07:43.634 --> 00:07:47.484
He offered his services to the Ottomans, proving himself useful

00:07:47.494 --> 00:07:50.914
as a warrior and enforcer in the empire’s Balkan provinces.

00:07:51.534 --> 00:07:56.554
His ability to quash revolts and maintain order earned him the trust of the Sultan’s

00:07:56.584 --> 00:08:04.914
government, and in 1788, he was appointed Pasha of Ioannina, the capital of the Epirus region.

00:08:06.094 --> 00:08:09.604
Even this was something of an anomaly.

00:08:10.274 --> 00:08:16.304
Usually, these Pasha, the regional rulers, were appointed in Constantinople and

00:08:16.504 --> 00:08:21.024
sent out to rule in whatever far-flung province the Sultan had assigned to them.

00:08:21.894 --> 00:08:23.314
Not Ali Pasha.

00:08:23.884 --> 00:08:28.244
He was from there, he was home-grown, which meant that he already had

00:08:28.254 --> 00:08:33.284
a lot of power and influence, but it was only after he was officially

00:08:33.294 --> 00:08:38.381
appointed by the Sultan that this was cemented, and enshrined in law.

00:08:39.349 --> 00:08:43.130
And this is where Ali Pasha’s story really begins.

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:50.480
Once he became Pasha of Ioannina, Ali wasted no time in consolidating his power.

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:54.680
He was no ordinary Ottoman governor, content to

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:57.840
simply administer a province on behalf of the Sultan.

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:02.690
No, he ruled Ioannina as if it were his own kingdom.

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:09.640
Through brutality, cunning diplomacy, and strategic alliances, he turned his province

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:14.750
into one of the most powerful semi-independent states within the Ottoman Empire.

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:19.650
He expanded his influence into western Macedonia and much of

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:24.120
Albania, bringing more and more territory under his personal control.

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:30.594
And this territory was not just vast—it was strategically vital.

00:09:31.626 --> 00:09:38.770
It sat at the crossroads between the Adriatic and the Aegean, so control over it

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:43.940
meant controlling key trade routes between Western Europe and the Ottoman Balkans.

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:51.060
This made him not just a local warlord but a player in international politics.

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:58.090
This was the late 18th century, and key European powers, such as Britain, France

00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:02.460
and Russia, were all competing for influence in the weakening Ottoman Empire.

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:08.150
In Ali Pasha, they saw someone who was more than a mere local

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:12.570
administrator; they recognised a powerful local leader who controlled

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:17.440
a key Balkan region and someone who could prove incredibly useful

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:24.310
The British saw him as a potential ally against the French, especially during the Napoleonic Wars.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:29.540
Napoleon himself tried to win Ali over, hoping to use him as a

00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:33.100
counterbalance against British influence in the eastern Mediterranean.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.650
And the Russians, who had long been eyeing the Balkans for their own expansion,

00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:43.680
saw Ali as someone who could stir unrest in the Ottoman-controlled regions.

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:48.070
So, who did Ali Pasha choose to side with?

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:51.700
Well, all of them and none of them.

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:55.640
He played them off against each other, making secret deals

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:59.030
with all of them, securing weapons and political backing.

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:03.890
And he did all of this while maintaining his status within the

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:08.400
Ottoman ruling hierarchy; he had pledged loyalty to the Sultan but

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:12.750
at the same time he was secretly cutting deals with foreign leaders.

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:20.280
He was, in many ways, a Balkan Machiavelli, a geopolitical strategist balancing

00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:26.200
alliances, manipulating rivals, and ensuring his survival through cunning diplomacy.

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:32.940
He also had another technique up his sleeve: terror and fear.

00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:38.810
He executed enemies in gruesome ways, sometimes publicly, to send a message.

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:46.800
Perhaps his most infamous act of cruelty came when he drowned 17 women in Lake

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:52.099
Pamvotida, a story that has been romanticised and retold in Greek folklore.

00:11:52.909 --> 00:11:58.049
The women, who had been accused of plotting against him, were supposedly tied

00:11:58.059 --> 00:12:04.549
in sacks and thrown into the water, a warning to anyone who dared defy his rule.

00:12:05.729 --> 00:12:10.219
Now, if we can put aside for one minute this not-so-civilised

00:12:10.259 --> 00:12:13.709
aspect of his character, he was clearly a capable ruler.

00:12:14.378 --> 00:12:16.764
Ioannina flourished under his leadership.

00:12:17.154 --> 00:12:18.204
Trade expanded.

00:12:18.445 --> 00:12:21.870
The city became a hub for education and the arts.

00:12:22.188 --> 00:12:27.518
His encouragement of education and trade—paired with his brutal methods of maintaining

00:12:27.518 --> 00:12:34.518
order—created something of a paradox: a city that was both enlightened and oppressive.

00:12:35.507 --> 00:12:41.788
Now, by the early 1800s, Ali Pasha was more powerful than ever, but he was

00:12:41.788 --> 00:12:48.318
powerful on a regional level, and known within certain European diplomatic circles.

00:12:49.158 --> 00:12:52.848
And it might have remained that way had it not been for an

00:12:52.898 --> 00:12:57.318
unexpected visitor, a young English nobleman named Lord Byron.

00:12:58.088 --> 00:13:04.558
The year was 1809, and Byron was not yet the famous poet that he would become.

00:13:05.248 --> 00:13:10.888
He was just another wealthy young aristocrat travelling through Europe on the Grand Tour, but

00:13:11.418 --> 00:13:17.598
unlike his peers, he had little interest in following the well-trodden paths of Rome or Paris.

00:13:18.228 --> 00:13:22.578
Byron wanted to see the wild, the unknown, and the exotic,

00:13:22.848 --> 00:13:26.153
which was part of the reason that he was drawn to Ioannina.

00:13:27.078 --> 00:13:29.438
The other part was a more practical one.

00:13:30.208 --> 00:13:34.328
The Napoleonic Wars had made much of Western Europe inaccessible.

00:13:34.898 --> 00:13:40.738
Paris, Venice, Rome, Naples, all the conventional stops were not an option.

00:13:41.588 --> 00:13:46.578
Instead, Byron travelled through Portugal, Spain, and the Balkans.

00:13:47.278 --> 00:13:51.958
This brought him to Ottoman-controlled Greece, a land that still bore the

00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:56.758
ruins of its ancient past but was now under the rule of Ottoman pashas.

00:13:58.008 --> 00:14:03.348
For Byron, it was a place of contrasts—one foot in the glory

00:14:03.348 --> 00:14:07.248
of classical antiquity, the other in the world of the Sultan.

00:14:08.268 --> 00:14:12.538
And at the heart of it, in the city of Ioannina, he found

00:14:12.538 --> 00:14:16.368
a ruler who seemed to belong to both worlds at once.

00:14:17.208 --> 00:14:20.037
Byron was immediately struck by what he saw.

00:14:20.784 --> 00:14:27.548
Ioannina was unlike any other Ottoman town he had visited—flourishing, alive with trade and

00:14:27.828 --> 00:14:34.968
intellectual exchange, a place where Greek, Albanian, Turkish, and European influences mixed freely.

00:14:36.218 --> 00:14:40.658
But what fascinated him the most was Ali Pasha himself.

00:14:41.708 --> 00:14:49.648
Unlike the distant, bureaucratic Ottoman governors he had imagined, Ali Pasha ruled like a king.

00:14:50.368 --> 00:14:55.928
He was charming, intelligent, and eager to impress his English guest.

00:14:57.238 --> 00:15:01.188
Yet Byron was also unsettled by what he witnessed.

00:15:01.938 --> 00:15:08.298
Here was a man who lived in an opulent palace, spoke multiple languages, entertained European

00:15:08.298 --> 00:15:16.358
guests with refinement, yet ruled his lands with an iron fist, executing enemies without hesitation.

00:15:17.578 --> 00:15:20.718
Byron’s descriptions, which were published in Childe

00:15:20.718 --> 00:15:24.128
Harold’s Pilgrimage, sparked curiosity across Europe.

00:15:24.658 --> 00:15:30.188
The idea that such a figure could exist—a ruler who embodied both the

00:15:30.228 --> 00:15:35.038
exotic allure of the East and the ruthless efficiency of a European

00:15:35.038 --> 00:15:39.988
warlord—made Ioannina a must-visit destination for the adventurous elite.

00:15:41.198 --> 00:15:45.888
And following Byron’s writings, dozens of European diplomats,

00:15:46.158 --> 00:15:50.908
writers, and military officers made the journey to Ali Pasha’s court.

00:15:51.628 --> 00:15:54.978
The French novelist François Pouqueville, who spent

00:15:54.978 --> 00:15:58.078
years in the Ottoman Empire, wrote extensively about him.

00:15:58.562 --> 00:16:04.232
British envoy William Martin Leake detailed his experiences with Ali in his diplomatic missions.

00:16:04.782 --> 00:16:10.222
Even diplomats from Austria and Prussia sought audiences with the notorious ruler.

00:16:11.452 --> 00:16:18.106
And for a brief period, Ali Pasha’s court became something like an Ottoman

00:16:18.106 --> 00:16:24.016
Versailles—a place where politics, espionage, and literary fascination intertwined.

00:16:24.631 --> 00:16:31.401
European aristocrats came for the spectacle, diplomats came for the intrigue, and Ali

00:16:31.401 --> 00:16:36.591
Pasha ensured that all of them left with stories that would only add to his legend.

00:16:38.261 --> 00:16:44.531
But as his fame grew, so did the challenge he posed to the Ottoman Sultan.

00:16:45.397 --> 00:16:52.177
For decades, the Ottoman government had turned a blind eye to Ali Pasha’s semi-independent rule.

00:16:53.267 --> 00:16:53.707
Why?

00:16:54.237 --> 00:16:56.987
Well, because he was actually quite useful.

00:16:57.617 --> 00:17:01.347
He maintained order, suppressed local rebellions, and

00:17:01.517 --> 00:17:04.987
ensured that taxes were collected—at least most of the time.

00:17:06.187 --> 00:17:10.577
And as long as he kept the Balkans stable and maintained a veneer

00:17:10.577 --> 00:17:15.077
of loyalty, the Sultan had bigger problems to deal with elsewhere.

00:17:16.297 --> 00:17:21.937
After all, foreign commentators had been talking about the inevitable collapse of the Ottoman Empire

00:17:22.157 --> 00:17:29.887
for decades, and Ali Pasha seemed to be the glue that kept at least one small corner of it intact.

00:17:31.087 --> 00:17:36.037
But by 1820, Ali Pasha had gone too far.

00:17:37.227 --> 00:17:43.877
First, he had grown too ambitious, expanding his rule beyond what the Sultan could ignore.

00:17:44.797 --> 00:17:49.417
He had acted increasingly like an independent ruler rather than an Ottoman

00:17:49.417 --> 00:17:54.397
governor, negotiating with foreign powers without approval from Constantinople.

00:17:55.457 --> 00:17:58.867
His dealings with Britain, France, and Russia had raised

00:17:58.867 --> 00:18:02.417
suspicions that he was preparing to break away entirely.

00:18:03.877 --> 00:18:07.537
Secondly, he disobeyed direct imperial orders.

00:18:08.657 --> 00:18:15.087
In 1819, he had been ordered to hand over certain lands, but he ignored the decree.

00:18:16.257 --> 00:18:20.037
The Sultan could no longer pretend that Ali Pasha was

00:18:20.037 --> 00:18:23.147
just a loyal servant who happened to be a little ruthless.

00:18:23.837 --> 00:18:29.997
And the final straw came when he ordered the murder of an Ottoman official loyal to the Sultan.

00:18:30.867 --> 00:18:35.187
This was outright defiance, and the Sultan could not

00:18:35.207 --> 00:18:38.387
afford to let such an open challenge go unanswered.

00:18:39.487 --> 00:18:46.127
In 1820, he issued an imperial edict officially declaring Ali Pasha a rebel.

00:18:46.987 --> 00:18:52.677
The imperial army was sent in, and so began the long siege of Ioannina.

00:18:53.577 --> 00:18:56.587
For nearly two years, Ali Pasha resisted.

00:18:57.407 --> 00:19:01.477
Even as the Ottoman army surrounded his stronghold, Ali

00:19:01.477 --> 00:19:06.037
Pasha did what he had always done—he plotted and schemed.

00:19:06.527 --> 00:19:09.687
He sent out secret messages to Britain and France,

00:19:09.947 --> 00:19:13.337
hoping to stir up European intervention on his behalf.

00:19:13.917 --> 00:19:18.875
He also tried to turn other Ottoman governors against the Sultan, hoping

00:19:18.875 --> 00:19:23.255
to spark a larger rebellion that might force the Sultan to negotiate.

00:19:24.095 --> 00:19:28.825
But this time, his network of spies and assassins failed him.

00:19:29.606 --> 00:19:34.616
The Sultan’s forces had infiltrated his inner circle, and his

00:19:34.626 --> 00:19:38.916
desperate attempts to rally support only exposed his vulnerability.

00:19:39.946 --> 00:19:43.636
His own allies abandoned him, seeing no chance of victory.

00:19:44.986 --> 00:19:50.776
And in the end, the man once called the Balkan Napoleon, a master strategist

00:19:51.036 --> 00:19:56.026
who had spent decades outmanoeuvring his enemies, escaping traps, and turning

00:19:56.026 --> 00:20:01.086
the tables on those who sought to bring him down, well, he was outmanoeuvred.

00:20:02.336 --> 00:20:09.676
In February 1822, he was lured into negotiations with Ottoman envoys who promised him a deal.

00:20:10.616 --> 00:20:14.666
The deal was this: Ali Pasha would hand over his immense

00:20:14.686 --> 00:20:18.796
treasures, and in exchange, his life would be spared.

00:20:20.386 --> 00:20:26.156
Sensing that he might be being deceived but having little choice, Ali Pasha

00:20:26.426 --> 00:20:31.106
left his fortified citadel with his wife, entourage, and personal guards,

00:20:31.396 --> 00:20:36.218
and retreated to a monastery on an island in Lake Pamvotida, the lake in

00:20:36.218 --> 00:20:39.868
which he had thrown those women to their deaths several decades beforehand

00:20:40.878 --> 00:20:44.298
It was meant to be a temporary arrangement, a place

00:20:44.468 --> 00:20:47.638
where the details of the deal could be ironed out.

00:20:48.818 --> 00:20:54.108
But in reality, by holing himself up on an island, and a

00:20:54.148 --> 00:20:57.938
poorly fortified one at that, he had just sealed his fate.

00:20:59.108 --> 00:21:05.808
A few weeks later, a group of Ottoman officials arrived under the pretext of negotiations.

00:21:06.988 --> 00:21:13.195
Ali Pasha, suspicious as ever, kept his pistol close at hand but allowed the meeting to proceed.

00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:17.370
Nothing happened—no betrayal, no attack.

00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:22.090
Then, a few days later, the boats returned.

00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:27.110
This time, they carried Mehmed Pasha, a senior Ottoman

00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:30.810
official who claimed to bear a decree from the Sultan himself.

00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:37.610
Ali Pasha, ever cautious, refused to approach until he had read the document.

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:42.900
But Mehmed Pasha ignored him and ordered him to step forward.

00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:48.320
In that instant, Ali Pasha knew something was wrong.

00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:51.891
He pulled out his pistol and fired the first shot.

00:21:52.856 --> 00:21:54.823
Mehmed Pasha returned fire.

00:21:55.313 --> 00:21:56.413
Chaos erupted.

00:21:56.883 --> 00:22:01.503
The Ottoman troops rushed forward, swords flashing, pistols firing.

00:22:01.975 --> 00:22:04.965
One of them struck Ali in the arm with his sword.

00:22:06.295 --> 00:22:09.447
Ali’s bodyguards dragged him inside the monastery,

00:22:09.724 --> 00:22:13.325
barricading the doors as gunfire echoed across the island.

00:22:14.335 --> 00:22:19.935
The fighting only ended when Ali Pasha was mortally wounded by a shot to the stomach.

00:22:21.525 --> 00:22:25.445
Some say he fell instantly, others claim he crawled back

00:22:25.445 --> 00:22:29.405
inside, still resisting, even as his enemies closed in.

00:22:30.575 --> 00:22:35.115
His last words were, so the legend goes, “kill my wife

00:22:35.375 --> 00:22:37.925
so she does not fall into the hands of the Turks”.

00:22:39.555 --> 00:22:41.535
And then, the silence came.

00:22:42.265 --> 00:22:48.835
The last of Ali Pasha’s men laid down their arms, and the Ottoman troops burst through the doors.

00:22:49.865 --> 00:22:54.095
They beheaded Ali Pasha on the spot, carrying out the Sultan’s orders.

00:22:55.285 --> 00:23:01.715
His head was placed on a silver platter and carried back to the troops still resisting in his name.

00:23:02.555 --> 00:23:07.925
They had refused to back down, but the sight of their leader’s severed head changed things.

00:23:09.113 --> 00:23:12.423
The gruesome display did not stop there, as the dead man’s

00:23:12.423 --> 00:23:16.003
head was transported all the way back to Constantinople.

00:23:17.173 --> 00:23:21.633
When it arrived, it was paraded through the streets of the city, a trophy

00:23:21.923 --> 00:23:27.253
for Sultan Mahmud II, proof that the so called Lion of Ioannina was dead.

00:23:28.453 --> 00:23:31.573
Some say it was placed on the gates of the Sultan’s

00:23:31.603 --> 00:23:34.683
palace, a warning to others who might think of defying him.

00:23:35.617 --> 00:23:39.157
Others claim it was taken to the grand vizier’s palace and

00:23:39.157 --> 00:23:42.707
displayed on a dinner table in front of Ottoman nobles.

00:23:43.247 --> 00:23:47.997
One account even says that bodyguards interrupted a local archbishop’s dinner,

00:23:48.127 --> 00:23:53.077
slammed Ali Pasha’s head onto the table, and demanded payment for their ‘gift’.

00:23:54.297 --> 00:23:58.062
Whatever the truth, this was the end of the road for one of

00:23:58.127 --> 00:24:02.207
the most powerful and enigmatic figures of the Ottoman Balkans.

00:24:02.797 --> 00:24:07.657
A warlord, a kingmaker, a tyrant, a statesman—his legend lives on,

00:24:07.957 --> 00:24:12.647
but his empire, like his body, was ultimately divided and buried.

00:24:13.437 --> 00:24:15.377
So, who was Ali Pasha?

00:24:15.857 --> 00:24:19.407
To some, he was a visionary leader who ruled efficiently,

00:24:19.607 --> 00:24:22.777
expanded trade, and brought prosperity to his lands.

00:24:23.417 --> 00:24:29.047
To others, he was a tyrant—a man who used terror and cruelty to keep his people in line.

00:24:30.007 --> 00:24:34.397
Either way, he remains one of the most fascinating and complex figures in

00:24:34.437 --> 00:24:39.467
Ottoman history, a man who almost created his own empire within an empire.

00:24:40.347 --> 00:24:44.287
But a man who ultimately flew too close to the sun

00:24:44.827 --> 00:24:48.007
got burned and found his head on a silver platter.

00:24:49.107 --> 00:24:51.807
OK then, that’s it for Ali Pasha.

00:24:52.026 --> 00:24:55.237
I hope it was an interesting one, and if you hadn’t heard anything

00:24:55.237 --> 00:24:58.527
about this man before this, well, that you’ve learned something new.

00:24:59.387 --> 00:25:05.567
As a reminder, this is part of a three-part mini-series on the loose theme of the Ottoman Empire.

00:25:06.017 --> 00:25:11.357
Part one was on Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the father of modern Turkey, and next up

00:25:11.497 --> 00:25:16.187
will be an episode exploring the curious history of the divided island of Cyprus.

00:25:16.857 --> 00:25:21.487
You’ve been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:25:21.877 --> 00:25:27.057
