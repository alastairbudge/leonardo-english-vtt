Hello, hello, hello, and welcome

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:09.969
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:12.839
Minds, by Leonardo English, the show

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:14.599
where you can listen to fascinating

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:17.029
stories and learn weird and wonderful

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.089
things about the world at the same

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:20.959
time as improving your English.

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:24.222
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are

00:00:24.222 --> 00:00:26.442
going to be talking about Hannibal.

00:00:26.942 --> 00:00:29.132
He was the Carthaginian general who

00:00:29.142 --> 00:00:31.622
marched on Rome, is remembered as

00:00:31.622 --> 00:00:33.592
one of the greatest tacticians in

00:00:33.602 --> 00:00:36.672
military history, and almost destroyed

00:00:36.672 --> 00:00:39.142
Rome two hundred years before it

00:00:39.142 --> 00:00:40.942
could declare itself an Empire.

00:00:41.639 --> 00:00:44.859
OK then, let’s get started, and talk

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:47.929
about Hannibal: Rome’s Greatest Enemy.

00:00:49.259 --> 00:00:51.209
There are lots of promises you

00:00:51.209 --> 00:00:52.809
might have made as a child.

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:54.969
A promise to your parents that you’d

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:57.359
always tidy your room, or that if you

00:00:57.359 --> 00:00:59.249
got a dog, you would always take it

00:00:59.259 --> 00:01:01.979
out for a walk, even if it was raining.

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:05.519
Maybe it was a promise to a best friend

00:01:05.739 --> 00:01:07.959
that you’d be best friends forever, or a

00:01:07.959 --> 00:01:10.859
promise to a first girlfriend or boyfriend

00:01:10.879 --> 00:01:13.479
that nothing would ever come between you.

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:17.359
Now, most children–and I’d have to

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:19.589
include myself in this category–are

00:01:19.589 --> 00:01:21.819
not so good at keeping promises.

00:01:22.589 --> 00:01:25.969
Life happens, we change, and after all, it

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:28.639
wasn’t that important in the first place.

00:01:29.419 --> 00:01:32.429
But for one young boy, a promise

00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:34.609
made before his tenth birthday

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:36.679
would be something he would spend

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:38.989
his entire life consumed by.

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:42.799
According to one legend, this

00:01:42.849 --> 00:01:46.899
nine-year-old swore to forever be an enemy

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:49.509
of Rome, or to put it more precisely,

00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:52.819
he was forced to say, “I swear so soon

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:55.589
as age will permit...I will use fire and

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:58.429
steel to arrest the destiny of Rome.”

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:01.899
The boy’s name was Hannibal.

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:06.609
Now, to understand why a father might

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:09.169
make his child swear eternal hatred

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:11.989
towards another state, we need to look

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:14.399
at the world Hannibal was born into.

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:19.529
He was born in 247 BCE in

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:22.089
Carthage, in modern-day Tunisia.

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:25.709
At this time, Carthage was the

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.929
heart of a strong maritime power.

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:31.399
Its navy dominated the western

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:33.469
Mediterranean, its harbours were

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:35.299
filled with goods from across North

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:37.819
Africa, southern Spain, Sicily,

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:40.419
even as far as the British Isles.

00:02:41.429 --> 00:02:43.019
Its strength came

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:45.509
primarily from sea trade.

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:48.379
Rome, on the other hand,

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:50.389
was mainly land-based.

00:02:51.429 --> 00:02:54.149
At this point, in the late third

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:56.990
century BCE, it wasn’t yet the mighty

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.030
empire you’re probably picturing.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.170
It was a regional republic with control

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.050
over much of the Italian peninsula.

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.830
But many of the towns and cities it had

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.420
“brought into the fold” were resentful.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.640
Some had been defeated in battle

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.320
and forced into uneasy alliances.

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.040
Others had been diplomatically

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.550
absorbed, sucked up by this

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.150
increasingly dominant power.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.250
The term “Rome” at this point meant a

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.620
powerful, rising state, but not an empire.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:31.820
Not yet, at least.

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.740
This all changed with a war that came

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:39.310
to be called the First Punic War.

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.640
It began in 264 BCE as a struggle

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.050
for control over Sicily, the

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.510
large, wealthy island that sat

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.370
between Italy and North Africa.

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:54.630
It was under the control of Carthage,

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.090
but Rome wanted it for itself.

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:59.700
What followed was a

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:02.050
brutal, 23-year conflict.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.710
Rome had no navy to speak of when it

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.670
began, but it built one from scratch.

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.190
Carthage, the great naval power, was

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.410
pushed back, humiliated, and eventually

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.010
forced to sign a peace treaty that saw

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.550
it lose Sicily and pay heavy reparations.

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.359
It was embarrassing and expensive.

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:28.839
And it wasn’t only the loss of

00:04:28.869 --> 00:04:30.729
territory that was problematic.

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:33.885
Carthage tended to rely on

00:04:33.895 --> 00:04:37.285
mercenaries–paid-for soldiers–and

00:04:37.385 --> 00:04:38.675
at the end of the war, there

00:04:38.675 --> 00:04:40.255
were tens of thousands of these

00:04:40.265 --> 00:04:42.795
mercenaries who hadn’t been paid and

00:04:42.795 --> 00:04:44.655
were saying, “Where’s our money?”.

00:04:46.145 --> 00:04:48.275
Carthage didn’t have the means

00:04:48.275 --> 00:04:50.435
to pay, the mercenaries rose up,

00:04:50.765 --> 00:04:52.275
and there was a violent rebellion

00:04:52.285 --> 00:04:54.285
that almost destroyed the city.

00:04:55.765 --> 00:04:58.795
During all of this chaos, Rome snuck

00:04:58.795 --> 00:05:01.415
in and also took the Mediterranean

00:05:01.415 --> 00:05:04.125
islands of Sardinia and Corsica.

00:05:04.925 --> 00:05:07.795
Now, that is a very brief summary,

00:05:08.095 --> 00:05:10.975
but it’s in the aftermath of these

00:05:11.085 --> 00:05:13.635
twin humiliations, defeat abroad

00:05:13.925 --> 00:05:16.058
and chaos at home, that we find

00:05:16.428 --> 00:05:18.961
Hamilcar Barca, Hannibal’s father.

00:05:20.193 --> 00:05:22.623
He was a talented general and a proud

00:05:22.623 --> 00:05:26.003
Carthaginian, and, perhaps reasonably,

00:05:26.263 --> 00:05:28.533
he blamed Rome for all of this.

00:05:29.173 --> 00:05:31.593
In his eyes, it was Rome that had

00:05:31.603 --> 00:05:34.103
dragged Carthage into a ruinous war.

00:05:34.413 --> 00:05:36.373
It was Rome that had crippled

00:05:36.413 --> 00:05:38.363
Carthaginian power and taken

00:05:38.363 --> 00:05:41.033
advantage of its internal disarray.

00:05:42.153 --> 00:05:45.563
So, when Hamilcar set off to rebuild

00:05:45.563 --> 00:05:48.213
Carthaginian influence in Spain, where

00:05:48.213 --> 00:05:50.503
the silver mines were rich and the

00:05:50.503 --> 00:05:52.973
terrain made it an ideal place to train

00:05:52.973 --> 00:05:55.263
troops and launch future campaigns,

00:05:55.541 --> 00:05:57.831
he took his son Hannibal with him.

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.926
And before they left, so the legend

00:06:01.926 --> 00:06:04.416
goes, he made Hannibal swear that

00:06:04.416 --> 00:06:06.826
he would never be Rome’s friend.

00:06:07.876 --> 00:06:10.786
Hannibal was a man–or boy at that

00:06:10.786 --> 00:06:13.606
time–who clearly kept his promises.

00:06:15.166 --> 00:06:17.286
And it would be in the Iberian

00:06:17.326 --> 00:06:20.146
Peninsula–in modern day Spain–that he

00:06:20.146 --> 00:06:22.492
would learn the skills that turned him

00:06:22.492 --> 00:06:25.402
into such a formidable military commander.

00:06:26.843 --> 00:06:28.693
Like Alexander the Great, who

00:06:28.963 --> 00:06:30.683
grew up under the watchful eye

00:06:30.683 --> 00:06:32.598
of his father, Philip of Macedon,

00:06:33.053 --> 00:06:35.383
Hannibal spent his youth in military

00:06:35.383 --> 00:06:38.333
camps, on campaign, learning not

00:06:38.333 --> 00:06:40.743
from books but from battlefields.

00:06:41.473 --> 00:06:44.503
He saw sieges, skirmishes, the

00:06:44.503 --> 00:06:47.033
management of supplies and morale.

00:06:47.983 --> 00:06:49.693
By his late teens, he was

00:06:49.703 --> 00:06:51.003
already commanding men.

00:06:51.783 --> 00:06:53.963
He had no formal schooling;

00:06:54.313 --> 00:06:56.313
his education was war.

00:06:57.863 --> 00:06:59.743
After the death of his father and

00:06:59.753 --> 00:07:02.263
then his brother-in-law, Hannibal took

00:07:02.283 --> 00:07:04.953
command of Carthage’s forces in Iberia.

00:07:05.893 --> 00:07:08.933
He was only 26 years old, but he

00:07:08.933 --> 00:07:11.373
would prove to be more than capable.

00:07:12.303 --> 00:07:14.633
He was charismatic, brave,

00:07:14.963 --> 00:07:16.463
and cool under pressure.

00:07:17.643 --> 00:07:18.863
His men loved him.

00:07:19.433 --> 00:07:20.613
His enemies feared him.

00:07:21.793 --> 00:07:25.443
And he was a master tactician, as we will

00:07:25.463 --> 00:07:27.463
come to talk more about in a few minutes.

00:07:27.983 --> 00:07:31.573
But even with all of that, the idea of

00:07:31.573 --> 00:07:34.663
going to war with Rome was still a bold

00:07:34.663 --> 00:07:37.753
move, some might even say reckless.

00:07:38.723 --> 00:07:40.853
So why did he do it?

00:07:42.273 --> 00:07:44.893
Most historians believe the plan was not

00:07:44.893 --> 00:07:48.273
necessarily to destroy Rome completely, or

00:07:48.273 --> 00:07:51.833
to conquer the city, but rather to regain

00:07:51.833 --> 00:07:53.953
the territory that Carthage had lost

00:07:54.203 --> 00:07:56.953
after the first Punic War: specifically,

00:07:57.203 --> 00:07:59.053
Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica.

00:08:00.703 --> 00:08:02.283
The surest way to do this,

00:08:02.633 --> 00:08:04.593
Hannibal thought, was to take

00:08:04.593 --> 00:08:07.663
the fight to the Romans, in Rome.

00:08:09.133 --> 00:08:10.873
After a couple of years fighting in

00:08:10.873 --> 00:08:13.483
Iberia, and then the successful siege

00:08:13.483 --> 00:08:15.373
of a city that was allied with Rome,

00:08:15.683 --> 00:08:17.783
a city called Saguntum that’s just

00:08:17.803 --> 00:08:20.803
north of Valencia, the stage was set.

00:08:21.653 --> 00:08:24.683
In the spring of 218 BCE,

00:08:25.163 --> 00:08:27.693
Rome declared war on Carthage.

00:08:28.733 --> 00:08:30.903
The only question was, where

00:08:30.923 --> 00:08:32.303
would the fighting take place?

00:08:33.033 --> 00:08:35.223
The Carthaginians were in

00:08:35.233 --> 00:08:37.013
modern-day Spain; the Roman

00:08:37.013 --> 00:08:38.973
army was in modern-day Italy.

00:08:39.723 --> 00:08:42.323
Two Roman legions were sent across the

00:08:42.323 --> 00:08:46.023
Mediterranean to face Hannibal, but when

00:08:46.023 --> 00:08:48.403
they arrived, they found that Hannibal had

00:08:48.403 --> 00:08:50.353
done something they hadn’t bargained for.

00:08:51.593 --> 00:08:54.193
Instead of taking the quickest route, by

00:08:54.193 --> 00:08:57.908
ship, he had marched his men northwards,

00:08:58.089 --> 00:09:00.663
up through Spain and southern France.

00:09:02.063 --> 00:09:04.763
This Carthaginian force, which included

00:09:04.833 --> 00:09:07.563
tens of thousands of soldiers, cavalry

00:09:07.763 --> 00:09:10.463
and war elephants, would march across

00:09:10.463 --> 00:09:12.323
the Pyrenees mountains, through

00:09:12.323 --> 00:09:14.832
Gaul [in modern-day France], and

00:09:15.052 --> 00:09:17.402
over the Alps into northern Italy.

00:09:18.752 --> 00:09:21.542
And this wasn’t just a ragtag

00:09:21.562 --> 00:09:22.852
group of Carthaginians.

00:09:23.165 --> 00:09:25.265
His army was a multi-ethnic

00:09:25.305 --> 00:09:28.354
coalition: Libyans, Numidians,

00:09:28.354 --> 00:09:31.175
Iberians, Gauls, and Carthaginians.

00:09:32.095 --> 00:09:34.615
Each group brought different strengths.

00:09:35.765 --> 00:09:38.745
The Numidians, from what is now Algeria,

00:09:39.035 --> 00:09:42.115
were exceptional light cavalry — fast,

00:09:42.453 --> 00:09:45.612
agile, and used to hit-and-run tactics

00:09:45.612 --> 00:09:48.342
that confused heavier Roman formations.

00:09:48.852 --> 00:09:50.654
They didn’t wear armour, rode

00:09:50.684 --> 00:09:52.724
bareback, and were masters at

00:09:52.764 --> 00:09:55.440
harassment and retreat, so perfect

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:57.044
for skirmishing and flanking.

00:09:58.164 --> 00:09:59.734
The Libyans were often

00:09:59.734 --> 00:10:01.524
used as heavy infantry.

00:10:02.334 --> 00:10:04.804
Though they were originally supporting

00:10:04.804 --> 00:10:07.154
troops, many of them had been trained

00:10:07.334 --> 00:10:10.024
and equipped in the Roman style, with

00:10:10.024 --> 00:10:13.374
long spears, oval shields, and discipline

00:10:13.384 --> 00:10:15.894
drilled into them by years of warfare.

00:10:16.615 --> 00:10:19.645
They gave Hannibal a solid, reliable core.

00:10:20.695 --> 00:10:23.425
The Iberians, from what is now Spain,

00:10:23.635 --> 00:10:26.045
were fierce and mobile, and were

00:10:26.055 --> 00:10:28.595
especially suited to mountainous terrain.

00:10:29.685 --> 00:10:32.015
Their weapon of choice was a curved

00:10:32.025 --> 00:10:34.555
sword with devastating cutting power.

00:10:35.475 --> 00:10:36.975
They weren’t as heavily armoured

00:10:37.275 --> 00:10:38.710
as the Roman troops, but

00:10:38.975 --> 00:10:40.825
they were bold and adaptable.

00:10:41.695 --> 00:10:44.205
Then there were the Gauls, the

00:10:44.405 --> 00:10:46.115
recently conquered or allied

00:10:46.125 --> 00:10:47.865
tribes from southern France.

00:10:48.305 --> 00:10:51.995
They were unpredictable, loud, often

00:10:52.005 --> 00:10:55.625
drunk and at times undisciplined, but they

00:10:55.625 --> 00:10:57.955
could bring raw power and overwhelming

00:10:57.955 --> 00:11:00.075
force when unleashed in a charge.

00:11:00.965 --> 00:11:03.705
The army was a microcosm of Carthage

00:11:03.705 --> 00:11:07.225
itself: diverse, pragmatic, and

00:11:07.305 --> 00:11:09.745
driven by a combination of loyalty to

00:11:09.745 --> 00:11:12.625
Hannibal and a shared loathing of Rome.

00:11:13.835 --> 00:11:14.915
And, of course, there

00:11:14.915 --> 00:11:16.075
were the war elephants.

00:11:16.585 --> 00:11:19.775
Not particularly numerous, but terrifying.

00:11:20.515 --> 00:11:22.440
Roman horses had never seen

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:23.960
creatures like these, and

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:26.340
neither had most Roman soldiers.

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:29.100
The elephants were difficult to

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:32.030
control and not always particularly

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:34.960
reliable, but their presence caused

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:37.450
fear and chaos on the battlefield.

00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:41.760
And it was this army that marched

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:44.070
through Southern France and crossed

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:47.820
the Alps in the summer of 218 BCE.

00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:52.770
It’s still not clear exactly which

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:55.940
route Hannibal took, but there was and

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:58.760
still is no easy route across the Alps.

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:02.850
Managing it was a feat so bold that Roman

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:05.380
historians centuries later still couldn’t

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:07.670
quite believe it had actually happened.

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:10.870
The terrain was treacherous,

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:12.730
and the weather brutal.

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:14.890
They lost thousands of men.

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:17.073
The elephants struggled in the snow.

00:12:17.543 --> 00:12:19.413
Hannibal himself is said to have

00:12:19.413 --> 00:12:21.373
gone blind in one eye from an

00:12:21.373 --> 00:12:22.973
infection during the crossing.

00:12:23.993 --> 00:12:27.083
But against all odds, they made it.

00:12:28.283 --> 00:12:31.163
And what Hannibal found when he descended

00:12:31.173 --> 00:12:34.633
into northern Italy was… opportunity.

00:12:35.923 --> 00:12:37.963
Many of the tribes and cities

00:12:38.213 --> 00:12:39.793
that had been brought under Roman

00:12:39.793 --> 00:12:42.273
control were not especially loyal.

00:12:42.893 --> 00:12:45.391
They resented Roman taxes, Roman

00:12:45.391 --> 00:12:47.857
military conscription, and Roman

00:12:47.867 --> 00:12:49.717
interference in local affairs.

00:12:50.507 --> 00:12:52.727
They would do almost anything to be

00:12:52.727 --> 00:12:55.267
rid of their oppressor, and Hannibal

00:12:55.387 --> 00:12:57.647
was ready to take full advantage.

00:12:58.917 --> 00:13:00.827
He had no illusions about being

00:13:00.827 --> 00:13:02.947
able to conquer Rome by himself.

00:13:03.597 --> 00:13:06.317
His strategy relied on breaking

00:13:06.317 --> 00:13:08.286
Rome’s alliances, encouraging these

00:13:08.286 --> 00:13:10.386
Italian communities to join him

00:13:10.436 --> 00:13:12.796
and rise up against the Republic.

00:13:13.556 --> 00:13:14.966
If he could do that, if he

00:13:14.966 --> 00:13:18.226
could isolate Rome, then maybe,

00:13:18.236 --> 00:13:20.216
just maybe, it would fall.

00:13:21.796 --> 00:13:23.696
And the first step in that plan?

00:13:24.586 --> 00:13:25.666
Win battles.

00:13:25.756 --> 00:13:27.256
Win them quickly, and

00:13:27.256 --> 00:13:28.526
win them dramatically.

00:13:29.976 --> 00:13:32.556
And that’s exactly what Hannibal did.

00:13:33.376 --> 00:13:35.806
Now, there have been tens of thousands

00:13:35.806 --> 00:13:37.956
of pages written about the genius

00:13:37.956 --> 00:13:40.156
of Hannibal’s military strategy, so

00:13:40.336 --> 00:13:42.216
if you are a military history buff,

00:13:42.539 --> 00:13:44.609
you’ll have to excuse the brevity with

00:13:44.609 --> 00:13:46.159
which we’ll be covering them today.

00:13:47.099 --> 00:13:49.699
The first sensational victory came at

00:13:49.709 --> 00:13:54.039
the River Trebia in 218 BCE, not long

00:13:54.039 --> 00:13:56.719
after Hannibal had emerged from the Alps.

00:13:57.639 --> 00:13:59.429
A large Roman force was

00:13:59.429 --> 00:14:00.559
sent up to meet him.

00:14:01.429 --> 00:14:03.459
And just in case you need a reminder,

00:14:03.849 --> 00:14:05.809
Roman soldiers were incredibly

00:14:05.829 --> 00:14:07.699
well-drilled and well-trained.

00:14:08.629 --> 00:14:10.349
But they were ill-prepared

00:14:10.599 --> 00:14:12.441
for a master tactician.

00:14:13.869 --> 00:14:17.269
At Trebia, the Romans assumed Hannibal

00:14:17.269 --> 00:14:20.429
and his army would be weak, cold, and

00:14:20.429 --> 00:14:23.099
demoralised after the gruelling crossing.

00:14:24.259 --> 00:14:24.879
They were wrong.

00:14:26.108 --> 00:14:28.408
Hannibal sent his light cavalry

00:14:28.618 --> 00:14:30.248
to the bank of the river to

00:14:30.248 --> 00:14:32.418
try to draw the Romans across.

00:14:33.708 --> 00:14:36.748
The Romans took the bait and marched

00:14:36.758 --> 00:14:39.258
through the freezing river, assuming

00:14:39.508 --> 00:14:41.128
their superior forces would have

00:14:41.128 --> 00:14:43.728
no problem defeating the seemingly

00:14:43.728 --> 00:14:45.818
small number of Hannibal’s cavalry.

00:14:47.148 --> 00:14:48.448
Little did the Romans

00:14:48.448 --> 00:14:50.728
know that it was a trap.

00:14:51.725 --> 00:14:54.758
Hannibal's men, well-rested and hidden

00:14:54.908 --> 00:14:57.428
in ambush positions, attacked the

00:14:57.428 --> 00:14:59.558
Romans while they were mid-stream.

00:15:00.518 --> 00:15:01.658
It was a slaughter.

00:15:02.338 --> 00:15:04.018
The Romans were soaked,

00:15:04.388 --> 00:15:06.508
shivering, and unorganised.

00:15:07.304 --> 00:15:09.558
Hannibal’s cavalry outflanked them,

00:15:09.908 --> 00:15:12.208
and a hidden unit he had concealed

00:15:12.218 --> 00:15:14.888
in nearby reeds attacked from behind.

00:15:15.788 --> 00:15:17.668
The Roman line collapsed.

00:15:18.108 --> 00:15:20.498
Thousands were killed or taken prisoner.

00:15:21.278 --> 00:15:22.848
It was a textbook example

00:15:23.058 --> 00:15:24.328
of Hannibal’s genius.

00:15:25.298 --> 00:15:26.768
He didn’t just fight.

00:15:26.768 --> 00:15:27.928
He manipulated.

00:15:28.098 --> 00:15:29.888
He shaped the battlefield

00:15:30.088 --> 00:15:31.138
to his advantage.

00:15:31.634 --> 00:15:34.154
He attacked not only the Roman army,

00:15:34.224 --> 00:15:37.094
but Roman arrogance, their assumption

00:15:37.104 --> 00:15:39.134
that strength alone would be enough.

00:15:40.474 --> 00:15:44.144
The following year, 217 BCE, the

00:15:44.144 --> 00:15:46.534
Romans sent another army to stop him.

00:15:47.714 --> 00:15:49.964
This time, they met at Lake

00:15:50.034 --> 00:15:51.814
Trasimene, in central Italy.

00:15:52.574 --> 00:15:54.194
Once again, Hannibal

00:15:54.412 --> 00:15:56.524
lured them into a trap.

00:15:57.194 --> 00:15:59.604
He hid his army in the hills and

00:15:59.604 --> 00:16:01.574
waited for the perfect moment.

00:16:02.704 --> 00:16:04.764
As the Roman column marched along

00:16:04.774 --> 00:16:06.764
a narrow path at the edge of the

00:16:06.764 --> 00:16:09.734
lake, his troops launched a surprise

00:16:09.774 --> 00:16:11.614
attack from the high ground.

00:16:12.524 --> 00:16:15.224
The Romans were trapped: the lake on

00:16:15.224 --> 00:16:18.034
one side, the hills on the other, and

00:16:18.244 --> 00:16:20.614
enemy soldiers pouring down upon them.

00:16:21.594 --> 00:16:23.684
It was another massacre.

00:16:24.934 --> 00:16:28.114
Roman sources claim that 15,000 were

00:16:28.114 --> 00:16:31.414
killed, and another 10,000 captured.

00:16:32.564 --> 00:16:35.144
It remains one of the largest ambushes

00:16:35.164 --> 00:16:37.854
in military history, and is quite a

00:16:37.854 --> 00:16:40.904
testament to Hannibal’s supreme authority

00:16:41.164 --> 00:16:44.434
and control over his men, men who would

00:16:44.434 --> 00:16:46.724
have spoken dozens of different languages,

00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:49.307
and many who would be itching for the

00:16:49.307 --> 00:16:51.967
chance to avenge murdered loved ones and

00:16:51.967 --> 00:16:54.087
relatives at the hands of the Romans.

00:16:54.907 --> 00:16:58.267
There were something like 40,000 men who

00:16:58.267 --> 00:17:00.857
lay hidden in the wood above the hills,

00:17:01.047 --> 00:17:03.197
watching carefully as the Roman army

00:17:03.207 --> 00:17:05.397
marched far enough past for Hannibal

00:17:05.397 --> 00:17:07.367
to give the order to finally attack.

00:17:08.737 --> 00:17:11.237
And the result was, well, one of

00:17:11.237 --> 00:17:13.357
history’s deadliest ambushes, and

00:17:13.377 --> 00:17:15.507
another devastating loss for Rome.

00:17:17.317 --> 00:17:19.057
Rome, at this point,

00:17:19.317 --> 00:17:20.857
was in a state of panic.

00:17:21.637 --> 00:17:24.787
This foreign general had marched across

00:17:24.787 --> 00:17:27.377
the Alps, destroyed two Roman armies,

00:17:27.577 --> 00:17:29.831
and was now in the heart of Italy.

00:17:30.928 --> 00:17:33.107
Whispers began to spread.

00:17:33.857 --> 00:17:35.597
Would he march on Rome itself?

00:17:37.019 --> 00:17:38.647
But Hannibal didn’t.

00:17:39.277 --> 00:17:39.807
Not yet.

00:17:40.407 --> 00:17:43.267
And this decision, perhaps more

00:17:43.267 --> 00:17:45.157
than any other, has puzzled

00:17:45.157 --> 00:17:46.507
historians for centuries.

00:17:47.267 --> 00:17:48.937
Why didn’t he go straight for Rome?

00:17:50.467 --> 00:17:52.377
There are a few possible reasons.

00:17:53.117 --> 00:17:56.097
Firstly, Rome was well fortified.

00:17:56.427 --> 00:17:58.047
Its walls were high and thick.

00:17:58.457 --> 00:18:00.637
Hannibal didn’t have the siege

00:18:00.637 --> 00:18:01.817
equipment to breach them.

00:18:03.107 --> 00:18:05.787
Secondly, he may have hoped that

00:18:05.977 --> 00:18:08.207
with enough victories, Rome’s

00:18:08.207 --> 00:18:10.427
allies would desert it, and the

00:18:10.427 --> 00:18:12.257
city would collapse from within.

00:18:13.407 --> 00:18:16.007
A siege, he knew, would be long

00:18:16.047 --> 00:18:19.097
and costly, and his army had never

00:18:19.097 --> 00:18:20.867
been particularly good at sieges.

00:18:21.487 --> 00:18:23.677
Ambushes and surprise attacks on

00:18:23.677 --> 00:18:25.537
the field - that was his thing.

00:18:26.821 --> 00:18:29.331
And so instead, he continued his

00:18:29.331 --> 00:18:31.321
campaign through Italy, trying

00:18:31.321 --> 00:18:33.891
to weaken Roman alliances, break

00:18:33.891 --> 00:18:35.151
their hold on the peninsula,

00:18:35.441 --> 00:18:38.111
and draw them into more battles.

00:18:39.101 --> 00:18:42.391
Which brings us to 216 BCE.

00:18:42.641 --> 00:18:44.321
To the fields of Cannae.

00:18:45.331 --> 00:18:47.751
Here, the Romans had had enough.

00:18:48.591 --> 00:18:50.371
They raised the largest army

00:18:50.531 --> 00:18:51.771
they had ever assembled.

00:18:52.501 --> 00:18:55.831
Estimates vary, but some sources suggest

00:18:55.881 --> 00:19:00.351
up to 80,000 infantry and 6,000 cavalry.

00:19:01.501 --> 00:19:04.161
Two Roman consuls, each commanding

00:19:04.171 --> 00:19:05.901
half of the force, led them

00:19:05.901 --> 00:19:08.181
out to finally crush Hannibal.

00:19:09.811 --> 00:19:13.241
Hannibal had perhaps 50,000 men.

00:19:13.691 --> 00:19:16.087
He was outnumbered nearly 2 to 1.

00:19:17.834 --> 00:19:19.631
And yet, he won.

00:19:20.331 --> 00:19:22.931
Not just won; he annihilated them.

00:19:24.021 --> 00:19:26.351
At Cannae, Hannibal demonstrated

00:19:26.541 --> 00:19:28.731
perhaps the most perfect example of

00:19:28.751 --> 00:19:31.141
battlefield strategy in ancient history.

00:19:32.131 --> 00:19:34.051
He deliberately placed his most

00:19:34.061 --> 00:19:36.171
lightly-armoured troops, mostly

00:19:36.171 --> 00:19:38.421
Gauls, whom the Romans viewed as

00:19:38.421 --> 00:19:40.591
fierce but undisciplined warriors,

00:19:40.771 --> 00:19:42.111
in the centre of his line.

00:19:43.131 --> 00:19:45.761
As the Romans advanced, this centre

00:19:45.981 --> 00:19:48.311
slowly gave ground, forming a

00:19:48.341 --> 00:19:51.261
crescent, then a sort of half circle.

00:19:52.401 --> 00:19:54.171
To the Romans, it looked

00:19:54.241 --> 00:19:55.751
like Hannibal was collapsing.

00:19:56.211 --> 00:19:58.285
So they pushed harder, deeper,

00:19:58.386 --> 00:20:00.441
funnelling themselves into the curve.

00:20:01.241 --> 00:20:03.221
Little did they know that that

00:20:03.391 --> 00:20:05.651
was exactly what Hannibal wanted.

00:20:06.861 --> 00:20:08.711
Once the Romans were surrounded

00:20:08.741 --> 00:20:11.291
on three sides, his elite African

00:20:11.291 --> 00:20:13.951
infantry attacked from the sides.

00:20:14.421 --> 00:20:16.371
His cavalry, having driven off the

00:20:16.371 --> 00:20:18.631
Roman horsemen, came in from behind.

00:20:19.351 --> 00:20:21.011
The Romans were surrounded

00:20:21.021 --> 00:20:22.281
in every direction.

00:20:22.761 --> 00:20:23.581
They couldn’t move.

00:20:23.931 --> 00:20:25.761
They couldn’t fight; they were too

00:20:25.801 --> 00:20:27.981
packed together to lift their weapons.

00:20:28.321 --> 00:20:29.521
They couldn’t even run.

00:20:30.821 --> 00:20:33.231
What followed was a killing field.

00:20:34.341 --> 00:20:37.301
Estimates vary wildly, but it’s

00:20:37.301 --> 00:20:39.851
believed that around 50,000 Roman

00:20:39.851 --> 00:20:42.571
soldiers were killed in a single day.

00:20:43.351 --> 00:20:45.191
It was one of the worst defeats in

00:20:45.191 --> 00:20:48.121
Roman history, and by some measures,

00:20:48.421 --> 00:20:50.671
more Roman soldiers were being killed

00:20:50.731 --> 00:20:52.971
per minute than would be by machine

00:20:52.971 --> 00:20:55.061
guns on the battlefield of the Somme.

00:20:56.071 --> 00:20:59.471
And still, Hannibal didn’t march on Rome.

00:21:00.781 --> 00:21:01.341
Why not?

00:21:02.191 --> 00:21:04.621
Again, we can only speculate.

00:21:04.621 --> 00:21:06.651
Perhaps he lacked siege equipment.

00:21:06.711 --> 00:21:08.071
Perhaps he didn’t believe

00:21:08.071 --> 00:21:08.951
the city would fall.

00:21:09.171 --> 00:21:10.891
Perhaps he hoped Rome would

00:21:10.891 --> 00:21:12.281
finally sue for peace.

00:21:13.371 --> 00:21:14.991
But Rome didn’t.

00:21:15.541 --> 00:21:18.681
And this is where the tide began to turn.

00:21:19.641 --> 00:21:21.941
The Romans changed their strategy.

00:21:22.731 --> 00:21:24.921
They adopted what became known as

00:21:24.931 --> 00:21:27.281
the Fabian Strategy, named after

00:21:27.291 --> 00:21:29.653
the general Quintus Fabius Maximus.

00:21:30.931 --> 00:21:33.901
Rather than face Hannibal in open battle,

00:21:34.221 --> 00:21:36.671
they avoided direct confrontation.

00:21:37.291 --> 00:21:39.391
They harassed his supply lines.

00:21:39.421 --> 00:21:40.841
They wore him down.

00:21:41.831 --> 00:21:45.021
Now, Fabius Maximus had been advocating

00:21:45.021 --> 00:21:46.842
for this strategy since the early

00:21:46.842 --> 00:21:49.312
Roman defeats, but it was not a

00:21:49.312 --> 00:21:51.212
popular one with the Roman leadership.

00:21:52.332 --> 00:21:55.012
Rome was a military power, Romans

00:21:55.022 --> 00:21:56.732
gained honour and glory in battle,

00:21:57.442 --> 00:21:59.872
and running away from the battlefield

00:22:00.112 --> 00:22:02.752
instead of towards it seemed the

00:22:02.752 --> 00:22:05.302
antithesis of everything Rome stood for.

00:22:06.672 --> 00:22:09.308
Yet, after these three catastrophic

00:22:09.308 --> 00:22:11.966
defeats, it was agreed that perhaps

00:22:11.996 --> 00:22:14.256
Fabius Maximus might have a point.

00:22:15.616 --> 00:22:16.616
Years passed.

00:22:16.936 --> 00:22:19.156
Hannibal’s army remained in Italy

00:22:19.302 --> 00:22:21.926
but was fighting a war of attrition.

00:22:23.096 --> 00:22:25.396
The Romans would launch little attacks

00:22:25.396 --> 00:22:27.476
on parties foraging for food, they

00:22:27.476 --> 00:22:30.146
would burn fields and crops, and they

00:22:30.146 --> 00:22:32.066
would do everything they could to make

00:22:32.066 --> 00:22:34.716
surviving difficult for Hannibal’s forces.

00:22:36.296 --> 00:22:38.536
As for the Carthaginians, they were

00:22:38.536 --> 00:22:41.186
far from home, with no reinforcements,

00:22:41.436 --> 00:22:43.596
no steady supply of men or food.

00:22:44.436 --> 00:22:46.376
Hannibal’s initial hope, that

00:22:46.576 --> 00:22:48.926
Rome’s allies would rise up and join

00:22:48.926 --> 00:22:52.216
him, had largely not transpired.

00:22:53.056 --> 00:22:56.056
Some did, but most stayed loyal to Rome.

00:22:57.436 --> 00:22:59.496
Eventually, Rome took the

00:22:59.506 --> 00:23:01.686
fight back to Carthage itself.

00:23:02.706 --> 00:23:04.286
A seasoned Roman commander,

00:23:04.596 --> 00:23:06.886
Publius Cornelius Scipio, fresh

00:23:06.916 --> 00:23:09.096
from victories in Iberia, led a

00:23:09.106 --> 00:23:11.716
daring campaign in North Africa.

00:23:13.216 --> 00:23:15.876
To counter this threat, and because

00:23:15.886 --> 00:23:17.486
not much progress was being made

00:23:17.716 --> 00:23:20.186
in the Italian peninsula, Carthage

00:23:20.356 --> 00:23:22.556
recalled Hannibal and his forces.

00:23:23.646 --> 00:23:25.106
And it was there, at the

00:23:25.116 --> 00:23:28.406
Battle of Zama in 202 BCE, that

00:23:28.416 --> 00:23:31.156
Hannibal finally met his match.

00:23:32.486 --> 00:23:34.846
Scipio had studied Hannibal.

00:23:35.246 --> 00:23:37.396
He knew his tactics, he knew the

00:23:37.396 --> 00:23:39.716
advantages and disadvantages of his

00:23:39.716 --> 00:23:42.086
various types of soldiers, and he

00:23:42.086 --> 00:23:44.746
knew how Hannibal liked to fight.

00:23:46.186 --> 00:23:49.336
Scipio outmanoeuvred him, used Roman

00:23:49.336 --> 00:23:51.496
discipline to resist the initial

00:23:51.526 --> 00:23:54.006
elephant charge, and then exploited

00:23:54.016 --> 00:23:56.116
gaps in the Carthaginian line.

00:23:57.306 --> 00:23:59.674
Hannibal was defeated, and

00:23:59.744 --> 00:24:01.934
Carthage was forced to surrender.

00:24:02.914 --> 00:24:04.634
Hannibal lived on for

00:24:04.634 --> 00:24:06.114
another couple of decades.

00:24:06.244 --> 00:24:08.904
He entered politics, tried to reform

00:24:08.904 --> 00:24:11.754
Carthage, and later went into exile.

00:24:12.734 --> 00:24:14.664
He continued to advise other

00:24:14.664 --> 00:24:16.714
kings and even plotted further

00:24:16.714 --> 00:24:17.974
campaigns against Rome.

00:24:19.144 --> 00:24:21.474
In one display of particularly creative

00:24:21.474 --> 00:24:24.114
military thinking, in a battle between

00:24:24.144 --> 00:24:26.664
two naval powers in modern-day Turkey,

00:24:27.034 --> 00:24:29.864
he advised for poisonous snakes to be

00:24:29.894 --> 00:24:32.974
put into clay pots and then thrown onto

00:24:32.974 --> 00:24:35.504
the enemy ship, the logic being that

00:24:35.504 --> 00:24:37.854
soldiers on ships don’t tend to wear

00:24:37.854 --> 00:24:40.104
many clothes, and they can’t exactly

00:24:40.104 --> 00:24:42.934
run away, so having hundreds of angry

00:24:42.934 --> 00:24:45.034
poisonous snakes slithering around is

00:24:45.354 --> 00:24:47.444
pretty much any sailor’s worst nightmare.

00:24:48.354 --> 00:24:50.494
Now, despite the fact that he

00:24:50.504 --> 00:24:52.548
had been exiled from Carthaginian

00:24:52.548 --> 00:24:55.364
society, Rome never forgot him.

00:24:55.804 --> 00:24:57.254
They pursued him across the

00:24:57.254 --> 00:24:59.404
Mediterranean, determined to stamp

00:24:59.424 --> 00:25:01.574
out the threat once and for all.

00:25:02.664 --> 00:25:05.394
Eventually, cornered in what is now

00:25:05.414 --> 00:25:07.924
modern-day Turkey, and with Roman

00:25:07.924 --> 00:25:10.684
forces bearing down on him, Hannibal

00:25:10.974 --> 00:25:13.274
took poison rather than be captured.

00:25:14.584 --> 00:25:16.678
His last words are said to have been:

00:25:17.118 --> 00:25:19.928
“Let us now relieve the Romans from the

00:25:19.928 --> 00:25:21.908
fear which has long disturbed them.”

00:25:23.078 --> 00:25:24.718
He was 64 years old.

00:25:25.758 --> 00:25:28.348
And yet, more than two thousand years

00:25:28.348 --> 00:25:30.988
later, the fear he inspired, the

00:25:30.998 --> 00:25:33.013
brilliance he displayed, the legacy

00:25:33.013 --> 00:25:35.623
he left behind… it still lingers.

00:25:36.483 --> 00:25:38.623
Hannibal didn’t destroy Rome.

00:25:38.961 --> 00:25:40.613
But he very nearly did.

00:25:41.563 --> 00:25:44.243
And in so doing, he showed the world

00:25:44.393 --> 00:25:46.323
what a determined, brilliant mind

00:25:46.333 --> 00:25:48.563
could achieve with limited resources,

00:25:48.783 --> 00:25:51.253
a deep sense of purpose, and an oath

00:25:51.273 --> 00:25:54.143
made as a child that he never forgot.

00:25:56.643 --> 00:25:58.443
OK, then, that is it for

00:25:58.443 --> 00:26:00.303
today's episode on Hannibal.

00:26:00.545 --> 00:26:02.185
If you are interested, there are some

00:26:02.185 --> 00:26:04.115
really good videos about these battles

00:26:04.115 --> 00:26:06.055
on YouTube, with all sorts of people

00:26:06.285 --> 00:26:08.735
recreating them in astonishing detail,

00:26:08.915 --> 00:26:10.675
so if that sounds like your kind of

00:26:10.675 --> 00:26:12.475
thing, just search for Hannibal on

00:26:12.505 --> 00:26:14.655
YouTube and you’ll find some good stuff.
