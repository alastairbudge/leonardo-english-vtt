Hello, hello, hello, and welcome

00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:09.709
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:12.429
Minds, by Leonardo English, the show

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:14.119
where you can listen to fascinating

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:16.529
stories and learn weird and wonderful

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:18.539
things about the world at the same

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.359
time as improving your English.

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:23.569
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is part

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:26.669
three of our three-part mini-series on

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:29.369
“power struggles in post-colonial Africa”.

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:32.099
In case you missed them, in part one,

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:34.889
we talked about Mobutu Sese Seko, the

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:37.309
fiery Congolese leader who ruled the

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:39.739
country for more than three decades.

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:42.459
In part two, we talked about the time

00:00:42.599 --> 00:00:44.909
that the son of a British Prime Minister

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.079
and an ex-Etonian mercenary teamed up

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:50.869
to launch a coup in Equatorial Guinea.

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:54.409
And in today’s episode, part three, we

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:56.719
are going to explore what’s known as the

00:00:56.729 --> 00:01:00.079
Angolan Model, how China has reshaped

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:02.279
the rules of the game in post-colonial

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:04.339
Africa, trading infrastructure

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.499
projects for natural resources.

00:01:06.959 --> 00:01:09.329
It’s a fascinating story involving

00:01:09.349 --> 00:01:11.669
billions of dollars, geopolitics,

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:14.289
and the debate about whether China

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:16.569
is a partner in African development

00:01:16.769 --> 00:01:19.419
or a neo-colonial power in disguise.

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:21.849
So, let’s not waste a minute

00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:23.899
and get right into it.

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.309
Even the most amateur student

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:30.399
of history will know that wars,

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:32.899
in general, end up being pretty

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:35.169
bad news for everyone involved.

00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:39.099
And from world wars to regional struggles,

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.069
there have been some horrific wars indeed.

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:45.649
So, when a United Nations special

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.289
envoy describes a war as “the worst

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:51.928
war in the world”, well, it is

00:01:51.928 --> 00:01:53.942
something worth paying attention to.

00:01:55.298 --> 00:01:58.628
This war was the Angolan Civil War,

00:01:58.948 --> 00:02:01.638
which went on in various phases from

00:02:01.648 --> 00:02:06.192
1975 right the way through to 2002.

00:02:07.518 --> 00:02:10.708
It started out as a proxy war as part

00:02:10.708 --> 00:02:13.348
of the Cold War, with the Soviet Union

00:02:13.498 --> 00:02:16.108
supporting one side, and the United States

00:02:16.108 --> 00:02:18.218
and a mixture of other Western powers

00:02:18.488 --> 00:02:20.688
supporting the anti-government rebels.

00:02:21.408 --> 00:02:23.638
Of course, this is somewhat of a

00:02:23.648 --> 00:02:26.078
simplification; there were all sorts

00:02:26.078 --> 00:02:28.358
of different interest groups, and the

00:02:28.358 --> 00:02:30.948
nature of the conflict changed as it

00:02:30.948 --> 00:02:32.948
dragged on for almost forty years.

00:02:33.732 --> 00:02:37.904
But, in 2002, the conflict was over,

00:02:38.488 --> 00:02:40.748
and the country was in tatters.

00:02:41.768 --> 00:02:45.398
The total number of dead is unclear, with

00:02:45.408 --> 00:02:47.708
most estimates putting it at somewhere

00:02:47.708 --> 00:02:51.308
between 500,000 and a million, while more

00:02:51.398 --> 00:02:53.728
than 4 million people were displaced,

00:02:54.148 --> 00:02:57.188
⅓ of the entire population at the time.

00:02:58.368 --> 00:03:02.248
According to a UN report, 80% of Angolans

00:03:02.498 --> 00:03:06.539
lacked access to basic medical care, 60%

00:03:06.748 --> 00:03:10.938
had no access to water, and 30% of Angolan

00:03:10.938 --> 00:03:14.308
children would die before the age of five.

00:03:15.608 --> 00:03:17.878
Yet, just 10 years later,

00:03:18.248 --> 00:03:19.928
the tide had changed.

00:03:20.298 --> 00:03:23.258
GDP per capita had increased by more than

00:03:23.357 --> 00:03:26.998
5 times, making it, on the surface, one

00:03:26.998 --> 00:03:28.698
of the wealthiest countries in Africa.

00:03:29.718 --> 00:03:31.748
And fast-forwarding another 10

00:03:31.758 --> 00:03:34.798
years to today, well, things are

00:03:34.798 --> 00:03:37.078
no longer so rosy for Angola, but

00:03:37.368 --> 00:03:39.088
we’ll come to that in a minute.

00:03:40.108 --> 00:03:42.068
First, let me give you a very

00:03:42.088 --> 00:03:44.598
brief reminder about Angola

00:03:44.888 --> 00:03:46.598
and some Angolan history.

00:03:47.398 --> 00:03:49.128
It’s a large country on

00:03:49.128 --> 00:03:50.458
the west coast of Africa.

00:03:51.158 --> 00:03:53.398
If you imagine South Africa at the

00:03:53.398 --> 00:03:55.848
bottom, then going up on the west

00:03:55.848 --> 00:03:57.448
side of the continent, you have

00:03:57.448 --> 00:04:00.008
Namibia, and then you hit Angola.

00:04:01.208 --> 00:04:04.938
It was a Portuguese colony from 1575

00:04:05.188 --> 00:04:09.218
until 1974, and was used as a major

00:04:09.238 --> 00:04:11.658
slave trading port, sending slaves

00:04:11.718 --> 00:04:14.368
across the Atlantic, mainly to Brazil.

00:04:15.318 --> 00:04:17.858
Grim stuff, of course, but we aren’t

00:04:17.868 --> 00:04:20.508
talking about that bit of Angolan history.

00:04:21.168 --> 00:04:23.168
We’re talking about what happened

00:04:23.528 --> 00:04:27.098
after the civil war ended, in 2002.

00:04:28.298 --> 00:04:30.838
The country was on its knees.

00:04:31.308 --> 00:04:33.358
It had been ruled by a man called

00:04:33.358 --> 00:04:37.418
José Eduardo dos Santos since 1979, so

00:04:37.628 --> 00:04:41.038
throughout the civil war, but like a few

00:04:41.108 --> 00:04:43.138
other characters we’ve come across in

00:04:43.138 --> 00:04:45.768
this mini-series, he was deeply corrupt

00:04:46.088 --> 00:04:48.878
and amassed a huge personal fortune

00:04:49.078 --> 00:04:51.108
while his people lived in poverty.

00:04:52.138 --> 00:04:54.828
Dos Santos knew that the country was

00:04:54.838 --> 00:04:58.548
in dire need of being rebuilt: schools,

00:04:58.768 --> 00:05:01.748
roads, railways, airports, all of the

00:05:01.758 --> 00:05:04.058
basic infrastructure that had either

00:05:04.058 --> 00:05:06.738
been destroyed in the civil war or

00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.008
never been built in the first place.

00:05:10.428 --> 00:05:13.438
But there was no money to do this.

00:05:14.478 --> 00:05:17.338
The World Bank or the IMF were places

00:05:17.348 --> 00:05:19.888
where countries could ask for development

00:05:19.888 --> 00:05:22.278
finance, and they were typically

00:05:22.378 --> 00:05:24.938
happy to provide these kinds of loans.

00:05:25.638 --> 00:05:28.828
But they came with strings attached,

00:05:29.058 --> 00:05:30.928
there were certain requirements for

00:05:30.928 --> 00:05:33.258
what a country had to do in order

00:05:33.258 --> 00:05:35.648
to qualify for these kinds of loans.

00:05:36.848 --> 00:05:39.398
Typically, this meant increasing

00:05:39.398 --> 00:05:41.398
transparency, allowing more

00:05:41.398 --> 00:05:43.798
political opposition, and putting

00:05:43.808 --> 00:05:46.158
into place anti-corruption measures,

00:05:46.688 --> 00:05:49.218
all stuff that World Bank and IMF

00:05:49.228 --> 00:05:51.488
economists required any country to

00:05:51.488 --> 00:05:53.908
do in order to qualify for a loan.

00:05:55.448 --> 00:05:58.468
And for most of the late 20th

00:05:58.468 --> 00:06:00.318
century, for countries that

00:06:00.318 --> 00:06:02.128
desperately needed development

00:06:02.128 --> 00:06:05.158
finance, this was the only option.

00:06:05.818 --> 00:06:07.438
Take it or leave it.

00:06:08.888 --> 00:06:12.358
But in the early 21st century, this

00:06:12.358 --> 00:06:15.648
started to not be the only game in town.

00:06:17.128 --> 00:06:18.128
On the other side of the

00:06:18.128 --> 00:06:20.488
world, the Chinese economy was

00:06:20.508 --> 00:06:22.708
growing at breakneck speed.

00:06:23.588 --> 00:06:26.248
China doesn’t have particularly large

00:06:26.278 --> 00:06:28.678
oil reserves, especially compared to

00:06:28.678 --> 00:06:31.108
its population and its energy needs,

00:06:31.578 --> 00:06:35.148
and since 1993, it has been a net

00:06:35.548 --> 00:06:38.728
importer of oil, buying oil from all

00:06:38.728 --> 00:06:40.678
over the world to meet its needs.

00:06:41.538 --> 00:06:45.078
China had plenty of US dollars, given its

00:06:45.108 --> 00:06:47.218
increasing exports to the United States.

00:06:47.618 --> 00:06:49.908
So Chinese policymakers

00:06:50.248 --> 00:06:51.908
proposed a solution.

00:06:52.878 --> 00:06:55.238
China would lend Angola the money

00:06:55.238 --> 00:06:57.838
it needed to rebuild the country, at

00:06:57.838 --> 00:07:01.108
fair, even below-market interest rates.

00:07:01.978 --> 00:07:04.168
And it wouldn’t ask questions

00:07:04.168 --> 00:07:05.848
about making steps towards

00:07:05.848 --> 00:07:08.008
democracy or anti-corruption.

00:07:08.598 --> 00:07:11.248
China was not going to interfere in the

00:07:11.258 --> 00:07:13.158
domestic affairs of another country.

00:07:13.948 --> 00:07:16.948
But, it did want something in return.

00:07:18.068 --> 00:07:18.468
Oil.

00:07:19.678 --> 00:07:23.538
See, Angola has vast oil reserves - an

00:07:23.558 --> 00:07:26.396
estimated 9 billion barrels worth.

00:07:27.916 --> 00:07:30.566
The deal would be structured broadly

00:07:30.606 --> 00:07:33.356
as follows: China would give Angola

00:07:33.356 --> 00:07:35.316
the money it so desperately needed,

00:07:35.716 --> 00:07:39.026
and in return, Angola would be

00:07:39.026 --> 00:07:41.686
required to sell China a certain

00:07:41.686 --> 00:07:43.876
number of barrels of oil every month.

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:47.040
The money was to be spent on certain

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:49.630
pre-agreed-upon infrastructure projects,

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:53.400
like roads, hospitals, and housing, and

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:55.710
there was typically a condition that a

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:58.320
certain percentage of the work would need

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:00.800
to be carried out by Chinese companies.

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:03.920
For China, it looked to

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.240
be a pretty good deal.

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:09.010
It was securing a source of future oil

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:11.220
imports, it was generating work for

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:14.450
Chinese companies, and, on an important

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:18.030
but less tangible level, it was forging

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.720
a commercial and political alliance.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:25.100
And this, if it worked well, could

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:27.220
become a blueprint for deals with

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.350
other countries, and a way of

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.060
securing influence in areas China had

00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:34.410
traditionally not shown much interest in.

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:39.040
In 2004, the first loan

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:40.130
agreement was signed.

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:43.620
A mere $2 billion, with a guarantee

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:46.770
of 40,000 barrels per day, but

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:49.070
this was quickly followed by more.

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:52.750
In the following 14 years, there were

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:56.090
an estimated 43 billion dollars worth

00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:59.620
of loans provided by China to Angola.

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:04.690
And for much of this period, it seemed

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:08.080
to be a textbook example of a new

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:11.250
development model - one that, in many

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:14.290
ways, was truly mutually beneficial.

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:18.420
China became Angola’s top customer,

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.370
overtaking the United States.

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:23.910
Oil production doubled, roads,

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.320
hospitals, and housing sprang

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.770
up all over the country, and the

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:32.280
Angolan economy grew at 11% a year.

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:37.080
By 2012, Chinese nationals had

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:38.680
become the largest immigrant group

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:42.400
in Angola, with an estimated 300,000

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:44.320
Chinese workers in the country.

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:47.750
There were still concerns around

00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:50.070
corruption and nepotism, President

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:52.210
Dos Santos had handed over control

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:54.660
of several of the state-run telecoms

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:56.630
and energy companies to his daughter,

00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:58.681
Isabel, who has been accused of

00:09:58.681 --> 00:10:00.690
being just as corrupt as her father.

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:04.710
As a quick side note, Isabel Dos Santos

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:07.410
was found to be the owner of a bunch of

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:09.970
Malta-based companies that are accused of

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.410
being used to steal money from the Angolan

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:15.190
state, so I always find it interesting to

00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:17.880
see how these kinds of stories have a link

00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:20.110
back to this little Mediterranean island.

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:21.860
If you’d like to listen to more

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:23.950
episodes about Maltese corruption,

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:25.840
I’ll put a link in the description

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.080
where you can find those.

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:30.760
Now, stuff was being built all over

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:33.900
Angola, in economic terms, Angola was

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:36.710
producing much more and there was much

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:39.060
more money flowing into the country.

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:43.160
But how did this translate into the

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:45.815
day-to-day lives of the average Angolan?

00:10:47.065 --> 00:10:49.235
Well, things did get better.

00:10:49.875 --> 00:10:53.365
The average life expectancy went from 47

00:10:53.755 --> 00:10:57.875
in 2002 to 62 today, healthcare spending

00:10:58.045 --> 00:11:02.135
went from $29 per person in 2002 to

00:11:02.165 --> 00:11:07.755
$143 in 2013, on pretty much all major

00:11:07.765 --> 00:11:11.215
indicators, things got better, not worse.

00:11:12.315 --> 00:11:15.255
Bundled all together and looked at in the

00:11:15.265 --> 00:11:18.065
UN’s “Human Development Index”, Angola

00:11:18.235 --> 00:11:24.456
went from 0.44 in 2002 to 0.59  in 2015.

00:11:25.566 --> 00:11:28.756
This is all a positive development, but

00:11:29.036 --> 00:11:31.686
there are a few things worth clarifying.

00:11:32.836 --> 00:11:34.846
Firstly, it was starting from a

00:11:34.866 --> 00:11:38.036
serious low, an awful civil war

00:11:38.156 --> 00:11:39.566
that had ravaged the country.

00:11:39.856 --> 00:11:41.856
It was starting from practically

00:11:41.866 --> 00:11:44.446
rock bottom, so it would have been

00:11:44.446 --> 00:11:46.996
very surprising if it had got worse.

00:11:47.276 --> 00:11:50.396
And secondly, this growth wasn’t much

00:11:50.396 --> 00:11:52.496
different from many other sub-Saharan

00:11:52.496 --> 00:11:53.986
African countries at a similar

00:11:53.986 --> 00:11:56.546
time, countries that hadn’t received

00:11:56.616 --> 00:11:58.846
any similar Chinese-backed loans.

00:12:00.186 --> 00:12:04.336
And thirdly, in 2014, something happened

00:12:04.546 --> 00:12:06.916
that brought it all crashing down.

00:12:08.506 --> 00:12:12.378
The oil price plummeted, dropping 70%

00:12:12.706 --> 00:12:16.476
between the middle of 2014 and 2016.

00:12:18.016 --> 00:12:20.916
Angola still needed to provide China

00:12:20.926 --> 00:12:23.936
with the same amount of oil, but it was

00:12:23.936 --> 00:12:27.366
getting paid less, up to 70% less, for

00:12:27.366 --> 00:12:29.856
each barrel, meaning it would need to

00:12:29.856 --> 00:12:32.086
send China more than double the amount

00:12:32.086 --> 00:12:34.616
of oil to be paid the same as before.

00:12:36.246 --> 00:12:37.556
Now, it could have gone

00:12:37.556 --> 00:12:38.606
the other way, of course.

00:12:39.096 --> 00:12:41.416
If the oil price had doubled, then

00:12:41.416 --> 00:12:43.236
Angola would have been paid double for

00:12:43.236 --> 00:12:45.216
the same amount oil, it could have paid

00:12:45.216 --> 00:12:47.886
off the loan in half the time, and been

00:12:47.886 --> 00:12:49.736
in an even more fortunate position.

00:12:50.596 --> 00:12:52.806
But that didn’t happen.

00:12:54.266 --> 00:12:56.876
And because the Angolan economy had

00:12:56.876 --> 00:12:59.936
become so dependent on this “easy money”

00:12:59.956 --> 00:13:02.366
from oil exports, there had been minimal

00:13:02.376 --> 00:13:04.846
investment in anything other than the

00:13:04.866 --> 00:13:07.286
energy sector, which accounted for

00:13:07.286 --> 00:13:10.686
around 70% of the entire Angolan economy.

00:13:12.216 --> 00:13:14.546
This placed the country in a bit

00:13:14.596 --> 00:13:17.246
of a bind, some serious difficulty.

00:13:18.196 --> 00:13:20.326
Its ability to pay back its loans

00:13:20.326 --> 00:13:22.746
to China is highly dependent on

00:13:22.746 --> 00:13:24.906
the global oil price, something

00:13:24.926 --> 00:13:27.336
over which it has zero control.

00:13:28.206 --> 00:13:30.826
It failed to diversify its economy in

00:13:30.856 --> 00:13:34.346
any real way, so when the oil price

00:13:34.346 --> 00:13:36.856
fell, it was in serious trouble.

00:13:37.696 --> 00:13:40.006
And because the money was so easy

00:13:40.316 --> 00:13:42.166
during the first few years of the

00:13:42.166 --> 00:13:44.136
agreement, there was little investment

00:13:44.286 --> 00:13:46.796
in oil production facilities or

00:13:46.946 --> 00:13:49.566
in exploration for new oil fields.

00:13:50.836 --> 00:13:53.866
Fast forward a few years, and Angola

00:13:54.066 --> 00:13:55.896
has found that its energy industry,

00:13:56.256 --> 00:13:58.809
with its ageing equipment and lack of

00:13:58.809 --> 00:14:01.569
investment, simply isn’t able to produce

00:14:01.569 --> 00:14:04.069
as much oil as it was 10 years ago.

00:14:05.309 --> 00:14:10.459
From 2019 to 2023, Angola’s oil production

00:14:10.689 --> 00:14:15.589
actually fell by 22%, and this is all

00:14:15.589 --> 00:14:18.249
at a time when global oil prices are

00:14:18.249 --> 00:14:20.699
much lower than they were in the early

00:14:20.699 --> 00:14:23.239
years of the oil-backed Chinese loans.

00:14:23.819 --> 00:14:27.609
So Angola is exporting less, and being

00:14:27.639 --> 00:14:30.169
paid less for what it does export.

00:14:31.029 --> 00:14:34.189
Now, what is the impact of all of this?

00:14:34.899 --> 00:14:37.279
In the grand scheme of things, it’s of

00:14:37.289 --> 00:14:40.759
little importance for China; Angola was

00:14:40.759 --> 00:14:42.789
one of China’s biggest sources of oil,

00:14:43.099 --> 00:14:46.409
accounting for almost 30% of oil imports

00:14:46.549 --> 00:14:51.109
in 2010, but China has since diversified,

00:14:51.519 --> 00:14:54.139
opting for more reliable partners.

00:14:55.049 --> 00:14:57.659
Angola is now only just in

00:14:57.659 --> 00:14:59.389
the top 10 of the list of

00:14:59.389 --> 00:15:01.149
biggest oil exporters to China.

00:15:02.159 --> 00:15:06.139
But all of this matters a lot for Angola,

00:15:06.529 --> 00:15:08.939
for whom China is still the largest

00:15:08.939 --> 00:15:11.539
export customer by a large margin.

00:15:12.959 --> 00:15:16.289
And given the terms of the loan and the

00:15:16.289 --> 00:15:18.189
reduction in Angola’s oil production

00:15:18.189 --> 00:15:20.759
capacity, a considerable proportion

00:15:20.779 --> 00:15:23.849
the oil that Angola is able to export

00:15:24.129 --> 00:15:26.789
needs to go to China; meaning it

00:15:26.789 --> 00:15:29.049
can’t be sold on the open market.

00:15:30.389 --> 00:15:34.549
In 2017, when Dos Santos finally stepped

00:15:34.549 --> 00:15:37.249
down as President, one of the big policy

00:15:37.249 --> 00:15:40.229
moves of the new president was to distance

00:15:40.229 --> 00:15:43.059
himself from China, and what had come

00:15:43.059 --> 00:15:46.359
to be called the Angolan Model, instead,

00:15:46.779 --> 00:15:48.859
turning towards the United States.

00:15:50.059 --> 00:15:52.459
By this time, economic growth

00:15:52.519 --> 00:15:54.659
in Angola had stagnated.

00:15:55.869 --> 00:15:57.899
There were glittering new highways and

00:15:58.069 --> 00:16:00.089
apartment buildings across the country,

00:16:00.489 --> 00:16:03.299
but they had been mainly built by Chinese

00:16:03.299 --> 00:16:05.549
companies and Chinese contractors,

00:16:05.939 --> 00:16:08.109
most of whom had left the country.

00:16:08.849 --> 00:16:11.139
There simply wasn’t the expertise

00:16:11.319 --> 00:16:13.549
within the Angolan workforce to

00:16:13.569 --> 00:16:15.469
continue the momentum that was built

00:16:15.469 --> 00:16:18.229
up during this period, nor was there

00:16:18.259 --> 00:16:20.589
the extra financing to support it.

00:16:22.019 --> 00:16:24.439
And bringing it forward to today,

00:16:25.105 --> 00:16:28.219
Angola’s GDP per capita has decreased

00:16:28.399 --> 00:16:32.309
by more than 50% from its 2014 highs,

00:16:32.729 --> 00:16:36.529
and it's now back where it was in 2006.

00:16:38.029 --> 00:16:40.999
Now, to the critics of this “Angolan

00:16:41.009 --> 00:16:42.669
Model”, they have been quick to

00:16:42.669 --> 00:16:45.139
stand up and say, “I told you so, of

00:16:45.189 --> 00:16:47.089
course, providing tens of billions

00:16:47.089 --> 00:16:48.689
of dollars to a country with weak

00:16:48.689 --> 00:16:50.859
institutions and endemic corruption

00:16:50.999 --> 00:16:52.699
would be a recipe for disaster”.

00:16:53.889 --> 00:16:56.099
These critics also pointed at the

00:16:56.099 --> 00:16:58.369
fact that the infrastructure projects

00:16:58.379 --> 00:17:00.309
in the country would be completed

00:17:00.329 --> 00:17:02.519
by Chinese companies with Chinese

00:17:02.519 --> 00:17:05.379
workers, thereby doing little to

00:17:05.439 --> 00:17:08.349
upskill the Angolan workforce, or put

00:17:08.349 --> 00:17:10.599
money back into the local economy.

00:17:11.479 --> 00:17:13.699
Chinese workers would be flown in,

00:17:13.999 --> 00:17:15.699
they would send money back to China,

00:17:16.129 --> 00:17:18.599
and there was very little trickle-down

00:17:18.599 --> 00:17:20.529
effect into the local economy.

00:17:21.789 --> 00:17:23.429
Then there’s the question

00:17:23.429 --> 00:17:25.319
of who really benefited.

00:17:26.359 --> 00:17:29.469
While ordinary Angolans saw some

00:17:29.479 --> 00:17:32.829
gains, the elite, like dos Santos, his

00:17:32.829 --> 00:17:35.009
daughter Isabel, and their cronies,

00:17:35.309 --> 00:17:37.919
they siphoned off staggering sums.

00:17:39.039 --> 00:17:41.579
Isabel Dos Santos’ empire, with its

00:17:41.759 --> 00:17:44.219
shady Malta-based companies, became

00:17:44.219 --> 00:17:46.489
a symbol of how the system enriched

00:17:46.489 --> 00:17:48.739
a few while leaving most behind.

00:17:49.922 --> 00:17:51.692
The Chinese loans certainly

00:17:51.692 --> 00:17:53.372
didn’t cause this corruption,

00:17:53.762 --> 00:17:55.622
but they didn’t help either.

00:17:56.782 --> 00:17:59.682
By turning a blind eye, so the critics

00:17:59.702 --> 00:18:02.692
argue, China enabled a system where

00:18:02.752 --> 00:18:05.662
billions vanished into offshore accounts.

00:18:06.682 --> 00:18:08.652
However, on the other side,

00:18:09.032 --> 00:18:10.652
there are those who argue this

00:18:10.662 --> 00:18:12.792
is a serious simplification.

00:18:13.932 --> 00:18:16.042
Given that the Chinese loans were

00:18:16.062 --> 00:18:18.752
tied to infrastructure projects, and

00:18:18.962 --> 00:18:21.492
the money went from Chinese banks to

00:18:21.522 --> 00:18:23.722
Chinese companies, there was actually

00:18:23.782 --> 00:18:26.522
less potential for corruption than there

00:18:26.572 --> 00:18:29.282
would have been with ordinary cash loans.

00:18:30.282 --> 00:18:32.312
Yes, because we are talking about tens

00:18:32.312 --> 00:18:34.272
of billions of dollars in a highly

00:18:34.272 --> 00:18:36.482
corrupt country with weak institutions,

00:18:36.912 --> 00:18:38.332
of course, there would be a little

00:18:38.332 --> 00:18:41.012
bit of corruption, but the structure

00:18:41.052 --> 00:18:42.922
of these infrastructure-backed loans

00:18:43.182 --> 00:18:45.342
meant it was harder for money to end

00:18:45.342 --> 00:18:47.432
up in a government official’s pocket.

00:18:48.512 --> 00:18:51.012
And as to the question of these

00:18:51.012 --> 00:18:53.572
loans requiring Angola to use Chinese

00:18:53.572 --> 00:18:56.332
companies, well, of course, a country

00:18:56.332 --> 00:18:58.272
would prefer to give contracts to its

00:18:58.352 --> 00:19:01.202
own companies, it would be strange,

00:19:01.412 --> 00:19:03.632
irresponsible perhaps, if it didn’t.

00:19:04.942 --> 00:19:07.662
And China didn’t force the Angolan

00:19:07.662 --> 00:19:09.102
government to take this loan.

00:19:10.092 --> 00:19:13.002
In fact, Angola had tried to get loans

00:19:13.012 --> 00:19:15.682
from the IMF and the World Bank, but

00:19:15.922 --> 00:19:18.302
Dos Santos didn’t like the requirements

00:19:18.302 --> 00:19:20.622
of the loan: increased transparency

00:19:20.882 --> 00:19:22.432
and anti-corruption measures.

00:19:23.722 --> 00:19:26.282
Angola had two options: the

00:19:26.312 --> 00:19:28.622
IMF route or the China route.

00:19:29.322 --> 00:19:32.412
It made its choice, and China shouldn’t be

00:19:32.412 --> 00:19:35.712
blamed or held responsible when its terms

00:19:35.812 --> 00:19:38.102
were perfectly clear from the outset.

00:19:39.442 --> 00:19:41.372
So, what’s the verdict

00:19:41.652 --> 00:19:42.902
on the Angolan Model?

00:19:43.802 --> 00:19:45.302
It’s tempting to call it a

00:19:45.302 --> 00:19:48.592
failure, but that’s too simplistic.

00:19:49.562 --> 00:19:52.292
For a decade, it transformed Angola,

00:19:52.862 --> 00:19:54.682
pulling it from the ashes of civil

00:19:54.682 --> 00:19:57.722
war into a brief moment of prosperity.

00:19:58.802 --> 00:20:01.352
But it highlighted the risks of the

00:20:01.352 --> 00:20:04.152
so-called Resource Curse, when a country

00:20:04.242 --> 00:20:07.012
gets so used to funds flowing in from

00:20:07.012 --> 00:20:09.362
a commodity that literally flows out

00:20:09.362 --> 00:20:12.012
of the ground that it fails to take any

00:20:12.012 --> 00:20:14.732
real steps to prepare for a rainy day.

00:20:16.202 --> 00:20:18.182
Across Africa, the Angolan

00:20:18.192 --> 00:20:20.872
Model has left a mixed legacy.

00:20:21.842 --> 00:20:24.622
Countries like Zambia and Kenya, which

00:20:24.822 --> 00:20:27.902
signed similar deals, are now grappling

00:20:28.002 --> 00:20:30.192
with their own Chinese debt burdens.

00:20:31.542 --> 00:20:34.692
To some critics, both Angolan and

00:20:34.692 --> 00:20:38.582
external, this is colonialism 2.0, the

00:20:38.582 --> 00:20:41.712
dangling of a tempting carrot in front

00:20:41.742 --> 00:20:44.582
of a resource-rich but cash-poor nation.

00:20:46.132 --> 00:20:49.762
But to others, China builds where the

00:20:49.762 --> 00:20:52.432
West only preaches, it is better to

00:20:52.432 --> 00:20:54.702
leave a country with roads, hospitals

00:20:54.712 --> 00:20:57.382
and airports than to hand out cash that

00:20:57.382 --> 00:20:59.542
will only end up in an official’s pocket.

00:21:01.034 --> 00:21:03.931
Angola’s experience is a cautionary

00:21:03.931 --> 00:21:06.601
tale, but it’s also a reminder

00:21:06.811 --> 00:21:08.831
that development is never easy.

00:21:09.511 --> 00:21:11.221
There’s no such thing as a

00:21:11.231 --> 00:21:13.581
free lunch, especially not when

00:21:13.591 --> 00:21:15.991
someone asks you to pass the oil.

00:21:17.941 --> 00:21:20.721
OK then, that is it for today's episode

00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:23.770
on the Angolan Model, and with it comes

00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:26.280
the end of this three-part mini-series on

00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:28.690
power struggles in post-colonial Africa.

00:21:29.370 --> 00:21:31.390
In case you missed them, part one

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:33.460
was on the leopard-skin hat-wearing

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:35.500
dictator of the Democratic Republic

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:38.210
of Congo, Mobutu Sese Soko, and

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:40.980
part two was on the foiled plot to

00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:43.200
launch a coup in Equatorial Guinea.

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:45.460
A bit of a mixture, I know,

00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:47.010
but I hope you enjoyed them.

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:49.990
You've been listening to English Learning

00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:55.900
I'm Alastair Budge, you stay safe, and

00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:58.320
I'll catch you in the next episode.
