Hello, hello, hello, and welcome

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.740
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.710
Minds, by Leonardo English, the show

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.450
where you can listen to fascinating

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.880
stories and learn weird and wonderful

00:00:16.889 --> 00:00:18.959
things about the world at the same

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.710
time as improving your English.

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.010
I'm Alastair Budge, and today it’s part

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.380
three of our three-part mini-series

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.980
on the making of modern Saudi Arabia.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.180
In case you missed them, part

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.210
one was on the man behind it

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.050
all, Crown Prince Mohammed Bin

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.506
Salman, otherwise known as MBS.

00:00:38.704 --> 00:00:40.480
Part two was on the country’s

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.780
plan to build a science fiction

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.879
city of the future, NEOM.

00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:48.089
And today’s episode, part three, will

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.499
be on a subject that isn’t so rosy;

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:53.389
the blood-curdling murder of the

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:55.687
Saudi journalist, Jamal Khashoggi.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.519
I need to mention a couple

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.809
of things before we start.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.470
Firstly, there will be a few

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:03.460
slightly graphic descriptions in

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.630
this episode, so it’s probably not

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.440
one to be listening to with young

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.779
children or on a delicate stomach.

00:01:10.199 --> 00:01:12.660
And secondly, I will be referring to

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.700
several events and ideas we talked about

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.080
in part one, on Mohammed Bin Salman,

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.620
so if you haven’t listened to that one

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.060
yet, or you don’t know much about Saudi

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.830
Arabia, now might be a good time to

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.070
press pause and go and listen to that.

00:01:28.809 --> 00:01:30.770
OK then, let’s not waste a

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.350
minute, and get right into it.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.070
Consulates are often unusual places.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.720
If you have never spent much time

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.380
outside your home country, you will

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:45.410
probably never set foot in one.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.267
They exist as these unusual microcosms

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.090
of your home country, transplanted

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.490
into the heart of another nation.

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.340
In theory, they are there

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.329
to serve and protect you.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.649
If you get into trouble in

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.190
another country, you get in

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:04.430
touch with the local consulate.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.460
If you need to get some sort

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.080
of official documentation–a new

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.470
passport, or a replacement birth

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.549
certificate–your consulate, or embassy,

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.640
is often your first port of call.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.781
And on the 28th of September, 2018,

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.520
one Saudi citizen went to his consulate

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.710
for exactly this; Jamal Khashoggi

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.610
needed an official document proving

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:36.240
that he was divorced, a document he

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.570
could show to the Turkish authorities

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.380
so that he would be able to get

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.650
married to his Turkish fiancée.

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.751
Khashoggi was older, at 59

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.269
to his fiancée’s 36, and

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.339
he wasn’t wasting any time.

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.700
The pair had met a few months before,

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.380
had hit it off, and had decided to marry.

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:01.940
Khashoggi was, of course, not a

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.510
random, unknown Saudi citizen.

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.010
He had become a prominent critic

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.980
of the Saudi regime, as we’ll

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.970
talk about more in a few minutes.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.059
And as such, he was a little cautious

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:16.930
about going into the consulate.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.310
Yes, it was in Istanbul, Turkish soil.

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.620
But he knew that setting foot

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.970
inside the consulate meant opening

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.359
himself up to the Saudi authorities.

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:32.859
And he had plenty of reason to believe

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.979
that this was a dangerous thing to do.

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.630
So he arrived unannounced, not

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.240
informing them of his visit beforehand.

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.080
To his surprise, he found the officials

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.290
he met there to be welcoming and friendly.

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:50.590
They couldn’t provide the documents

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.979
there and then; it would take a

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.690
few days for them to contact the

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.110
authorities back in Saudi Arabia to

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.779
prepare the papers, then he would be

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.799
welcome to come back and collect them.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.699
To someone fearing that they would be

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:09.740
handcuffed and forced to board a plane

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.609
back to Riyadh, Khashoggi must have

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.109
breathed a sigh of relief when he was

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:18.359
shown the exit, and felt the warm, autumn

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:21.459
afternoon Istanbul sunshine on his face.

00:04:22.739 --> 00:04:25.889
Little did he know that his visit had

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:28.689
triggered another phone call back to

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:32.109
Riyadh, and would set into motion a

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:35.819
plan involving a bone saw, a forensic

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:38.619
surgeon, and a murder squad with

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:41.949
him as their “sacrificial animal”.

00:04:43.079 --> 00:04:45.989
Now, let me return to the man in

00:04:45.989 --> 00:04:48.719
question, and why he wasn’t simply

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:50.339
provided with his divorce papers

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:52.629
and allowed to continue his day.

00:04:53.989 --> 00:04:56.629
Jamal Khashoggi had not always

00:04:56.889 --> 00:04:59.369
been an enemy of the Saudi state.

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:02.049
In fact, for much of his

00:05:02.049 --> 00:05:04.043
life, he was part of it.

00:05:05.123 --> 00:05:08.796
He was born in Medina in 1958

00:05:08.953 --> 00:05:11.013
into a well-connected family.

00:05:12.263 --> 00:05:13.913
If you are thinking, I’m sure

00:05:13.913 --> 00:05:15.173
I’ve heard the name Khashoggi

00:05:15.183 --> 00:05:16.983
here before, you’re right.

00:05:17.603 --> 00:05:20.503
His uncle, Adnan Khashoggi, was the

00:05:20.513 --> 00:05:22.413
self-declared “richest man in the

00:05:22.413 --> 00:05:24.633
world”, and one of the most famous

00:05:24.873 --> 00:05:27.113
arms dealers of the twentieth century,

00:05:27.413 --> 00:05:30.103
and also the subject of episode

00:05:30.103 --> 00:05:34.513
number 466, which is a fun one if

00:05:34.513 --> 00:05:35.783
you haven’t listened to it already.

00:05:37.173 --> 00:05:40.138
Jamal Khashoggi grew up close to the

00:05:40.138 --> 00:05:43.633
Saudi royal court, educated, privileged,

00:05:43.913 --> 00:05:46.253
and very much inside the system.

00:05:47.343 --> 00:05:49.853
As a young man, he became a journalist,

00:05:50.043 --> 00:05:52.303
working for Saudi newspapers and

00:05:52.493 --> 00:05:54.993
later serving as editor of some of the

00:05:55.003 --> 00:05:57.293
country’s most important publications.

00:05:58.273 --> 00:06:01.273
He reported from Afghanistan in the 1980s,

00:06:01.393 --> 00:06:04.053
where he met figures like Osama bin Laden.

00:06:04.743 --> 00:06:08.403
Now, at the time, this was not unusual.

00:06:08.973 --> 00:06:11.833
This was before Bin Laden became a

00:06:11.863 --> 00:06:15.093
global pariah, and at a time when Saudi

00:06:15.093 --> 00:06:18.103
Arabia, the United States, and Islamist

00:06:18.103 --> 00:06:20.853
fighters were all aligned against

00:06:20.853 --> 00:06:23.113
a common enemy: the Soviet Union.

00:06:24.353 --> 00:06:27.413
And this was a world in which Khashoggi

00:06:27.643 --> 00:06:30.373
excelled, a world where politics,

00:06:30.643 --> 00:06:34.453
religion and power all melt into one.

00:06:35.773 --> 00:06:39.886
So for years, decades even, Khashoggi

00:06:39.973 --> 00:06:43.183
was what you might call a loyal insider.

00:06:44.113 --> 00:06:46.273
He believed in reform,

00:06:46.303 --> 00:06:48.653
but reform from within.

00:06:49.713 --> 00:06:52.403
He criticised corruption and incompetence

00:06:52.693 --> 00:06:56.373
when he saw it, but he did so carefully,

00:06:56.743 --> 00:07:00.073
always aware of where the red lines lay.

00:07:00.633 --> 00:07:02.023
Or at least, mostly aware.

00:07:02.683 --> 00:07:03.973
He crossed them on several

00:07:03.973 --> 00:07:06.063
occasions, and paid the price.

00:07:06.433 --> 00:07:08.303
He was fired from editorial

00:07:08.303 --> 00:07:10.363
positions more than once, only

00:07:10.363 --> 00:07:12.953
to be quietly reinstated later.

00:07:13.563 --> 00:07:16.283
But this was how the system worked.

00:07:16.753 --> 00:07:19.413
Punishment, forgiveness, and an

00:07:19.413 --> 00:07:21.393
understanding that if everyone

00:07:21.433 --> 00:07:23.623
played by the rules, well, we

00:07:23.623 --> 00:07:25.493
would all get along just fine.

00:07:26.603 --> 00:07:30.113
But something changed in the mid 2010s.

00:07:31.263 --> 00:07:33.853
When King Salman came to power in

00:07:33.853 --> 00:07:37.323
2015, and his young son Mohammed Bin

00:07:37.323 --> 00:07:40.263
Salman began his rapid ascent, the

00:07:40.263 --> 00:07:43.333
old balancing act started to collapse.

00:07:43.923 --> 00:07:46.133
Power was centralised.

00:07:46.383 --> 00:07:48.403
Rivals were sidelined.

00:07:48.913 --> 00:07:50.563
Critics were no longer

00:07:50.583 --> 00:07:52.873
managed; they were silenced.

00:07:53.433 --> 00:07:55.973
There was no middle ground; you

00:07:55.973 --> 00:07:58.493
were either wholeheartedly with

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:00.683
MBS’s plan for the new Saudi

00:08:00.683 --> 00:08:02.903
Arabia, or you were against it.

00:08:04.633 --> 00:08:08.003
At first, however, Khashoggi seemed

00:08:08.063 --> 00:08:10.283
cautiously optimistic about the

00:08:10.283 --> 00:08:13.353
prospect of an MBS-led Saudi Arabia.

00:08:14.213 --> 00:08:16.983
He supported some of the early reforms,

00:08:17.013 --> 00:08:19.413
the promise of economic diversification,

00:08:19.653 --> 00:08:21.963
the talk of a more open society.

00:08:23.073 --> 00:08:25.363
After all, this was what he had

00:08:25.363 --> 00:08:28.303
spent years quietly advocating for.

00:08:29.686 --> 00:08:32.373
But as arrests of clerics,

00:08:32.473 --> 00:08:34.393
businessmen, intellectuals, and

00:08:34.453 --> 00:08:36.953
activists began to mount, his

00:08:36.993 --> 00:08:40.303
optimism turned to disillusionment.

00:08:41.383 --> 00:08:44.123
If he had had some hope to be a

00:08:44.123 --> 00:08:46.663
sort of regime-friendly critic,

00:08:47.123 --> 00:08:49.703
those hopes were soon dashed.

00:08:50.943 --> 00:08:53.903
And shortly after the Ritz-Carlton

00:08:53.933 --> 00:08:57.693
purge in 2017, he left the country.

00:08:58.593 --> 00:09:01.113
But he didn't flee in the middle of

00:09:01.123 --> 00:09:03.963
the night, and at first he didn't

00:09:03.983 --> 00:09:06.233
even see himself as an exile.

00:09:07.153 --> 00:09:09.083
He travelled to the United States,

00:09:09.413 --> 00:09:11.733
settled there, and began writing

00:09:11.803 --> 00:09:13.803
opinion columns about the Middle

00:09:13.803 --> 00:09:15.793
East for The Washington Post.

00:09:16.813 --> 00:09:18.933
His columns were measured,

00:09:19.313 --> 00:09:21.913
thoughtful, and often restrained.

00:09:22.433 --> 00:09:25.253
But he didn’t mince his words; he wasn’t

00:09:25.283 --> 00:09:28.573
afraid to call a spade a spade, to speak

00:09:28.583 --> 00:09:30.893
out when he believed it was necessary.

00:09:31.853 --> 00:09:33.463
He criticised the lack of

00:09:33.473 --> 00:09:35.463
free speech in the Arab world.

00:09:35.723 --> 00:09:37.623
He condemned the arrests

00:09:37.683 --> 00:09:39.113
of peaceful activists.

00:09:39.293 --> 00:09:41.583
He warned that Saudi Arabia was

00:09:41.583 --> 00:09:43.813
sliding into authoritarianism

00:09:44.183 --> 00:09:46.103
under the banner of reform.

00:09:47.623 --> 00:09:49.663
For Mohammed Bin Salman, for

00:09:49.956 --> 00:09:53.063
MBS, this was intolerable.

00:09:53.933 --> 00:09:56.403
Here was a man who knew the system,

00:09:56.483 --> 00:09:58.803
who spoke its language, who could

00:09:58.803 --> 00:10:01.133
not easily be dismissed as a foreign

00:10:01.133 --> 00:10:03.293
agent or an Islamist extremist.

00:10:03.993 --> 00:10:05.423
He was a court insider.

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:09.010
And worse still, he was listened to.

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:11.740
In Washington, in Europe, in

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:13.710
the very capitals whose support

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:15.110
the Crown Prince needed.

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:18.080
And that’s before considering

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.030
his almost 2 million Twitter

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:22.710
followers, most of whom were Saudis.

00:10:24.006 --> 00:10:25.830
Khashoggi’s was clearly a

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:28.430
voice that couldn't be ignored.

00:10:29.643 --> 00:10:32.133
Saudi officials began contacting him.

00:10:33.333 --> 00:10:35.053
Some urged him to come home,

00:10:35.403 --> 00:10:37.073
promising him that there would be a

00:10:37.123 --> 00:10:40.133
place for him in MBS’s inner circle.

00:10:41.153 --> 00:10:43.113
Others warned him, less

00:10:43.113 --> 00:10:44.543
subtly, to be careful.

00:10:45.313 --> 00:10:47.473
Friends told him his name was being

00:10:47.473 --> 00:10:49.443
discussed at the highest levels.

00:10:51.003 --> 00:10:54.273
Khashoggi understood the risks, but he

00:10:54.273 --> 00:10:56.853
believed he had a degree of protection.

00:10:57.563 --> 00:10:58.953
He was well-known.

00:10:59.253 --> 00:11:00.803
He lived in the United States.

00:11:00.973 --> 00:11:03.453
He was a high-profile columnist for

00:11:03.453 --> 00:11:06.033
a newspaper owned by Jeff Bezos,

00:11:06.273 --> 00:11:08.413
the founder of Amazon, and someone

00:11:08.613 --> 00:11:11.403
who MBS was actively trying to woo.

00:11:12.563 --> 00:11:15.443
And after all, he was not calling for

00:11:15.473 --> 00:11:19.173
revolution, for MBS to step down or for

00:11:19.173 --> 00:11:21.593
the Saudi royal family to be overthrown;

00:11:22.083 --> 00:11:24.503
he was just asking for some reform.

00:11:25.803 --> 00:11:29.036
And by the autumn of 2018,

00:11:29.413 --> 00:11:31.203
on a personal level, he was

00:11:31.203 --> 00:11:33.183
starting a new chapter of life.

00:11:33.873 --> 00:11:34.613
He was in love.

00:11:35.173 --> 00:11:36.343
He was about to get married.

00:11:36.723 --> 00:11:38.683
He was thinking about the future.

00:11:40.133 --> 00:11:43.123
And so, on the 2nd of October, a

00:11:43.123 --> 00:11:46.043
few days after that reassuring first

00:11:46.053 --> 00:11:48.963
visit, Jamal Khashoggi returned to

00:11:48.963 --> 00:11:51.253
the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.

00:11:52.473 --> 00:11:55.063
He handed his phones to his fiancée.

00:11:55.603 --> 00:11:57.533
He knew that they would be taken off

00:11:57.533 --> 00:11:59.653
him when he entered the building, and

00:11:59.873 --> 00:12:02.293
any half-decent professional could get

00:12:02.313 --> 00:12:05.013
into them and unearth the details of

00:12:05.013 --> 00:12:07.623
his communications with journalists and

00:12:07.653 --> 00:12:11.173
activists both in Saudi Arabia and abroad.

00:12:11.993 --> 00:12:13.953
No, he would go in with the

00:12:13.993 --> 00:12:15.906
absolute minimum, he told her.

00:12:16.983 --> 00:12:19.003
If she sensed that anything was

00:12:19.003 --> 00:12:21.933
wrong, he instructed her to call

00:12:22.073 --> 00:12:24.723
Yasin Aktay, a Turkish friend and

00:12:24.723 --> 00:12:27.883
journalist, and a close confidant of

00:12:27.883 --> 00:12:30.267
the Turkish president, Tayyip Erdoğan.

00:12:31.347 --> 00:12:34.843
At 14 minutes past 1, on the 2nd of

00:12:34.843 --> 00:12:38.913
October, 2018, he walked into the Saudi

00:12:38.913 --> 00:12:41.803
Consulate, expecting some paperwork.

00:12:43.193 --> 00:12:44.133
As you will probably

00:12:44.133 --> 00:12:46.033
know, he never walked out.

00:12:47.583 --> 00:12:50.033
A few days before his arrival,

00:12:50.493 --> 00:12:52.973
preparations had been made for

00:12:52.973 --> 00:12:54.983
what would go down as one of the

00:12:54.983 --> 00:12:57.333
most brazen assassinations of

00:12:57.333 --> 00:12:59.423
a dissident in recent history.

00:13:01.073 --> 00:13:03.083
The Saudi authorities, perfectly

00:13:03.113 --> 00:13:05.343
reasonably, didn’t particularly

00:13:05.493 --> 00:13:07.383
trust their Turkish counterparts,

00:13:07.903 --> 00:13:10.883
and in preparation, had thoroughly

00:13:11.113 --> 00:13:13.273
swept the consulate for bugs,

00:13:13.593 --> 00:13:15.353
hidden cameras, and so on.

00:13:16.693 --> 00:13:18.813
They then instructed all the regular

00:13:18.823 --> 00:13:20.983
staff at the consulate to go home that

00:13:20.983 --> 00:13:23.673
day – you’ve got the day off, enjoy it.

00:13:25.093 --> 00:13:27.643
That day, the consulate was going to be

00:13:27.653 --> 00:13:31.063
staffed by some “special guests”, men

00:13:31.353 --> 00:13:34.233
who had flown over on two Gulfstream

00:13:34.233 --> 00:13:37.603
jets from Riyadh, jets that were owned

00:13:37.613 --> 00:13:39.993
by the country’s sovereign wealth fund.

00:13:41.313 --> 00:13:45.083
On board was a squad of 15 agents,

00:13:45.323 --> 00:13:48.103
including intelligence officers, MBS’s

00:13:48.173 --> 00:13:51.273
close security detail, and a forensic

00:13:51.283 --> 00:13:54.323
doctor from the Saudi Interior Ministry.

00:13:55.463 --> 00:13:57.143
They were inside the consulate,

00:13:57.473 --> 00:14:00.083
waiting for Khashoggi to arrive.

00:14:01.213 --> 00:14:03.963
And if you are wondering how this is

00:14:04.043 --> 00:14:06.883
public information, well, I said that

00:14:06.893 --> 00:14:08.653
the consulate had been thoroughly

00:14:08.653 --> 00:14:11.753
swept for bugs, but it seems that it

00:14:11.763 --> 00:14:14.073
hadn’t been swept that thoroughly.

00:14:14.903 --> 00:14:16.753
There were several secret listening

00:14:16.753 --> 00:14:18.923
devices the Turkish authorities had

00:14:18.923 --> 00:14:20.933
placed inside the consulate that

00:14:20.933 --> 00:14:24.103
the Saudis didn’t find, and they

00:14:24.103 --> 00:14:26.523
recorded everything that happened.

00:14:27.793 --> 00:14:30.093
And I’m sorry to say that this

00:14:30.093 --> 00:14:31.753
is the part where we have to

00:14:31.753 --> 00:14:34.143
go into some grisly detail.

00:14:35.433 --> 00:14:37.783
As Khashoggi was about to arrive,

00:14:38.103 --> 00:14:39.873
one of the agents in charge of the

00:14:39.873 --> 00:14:42.813
operation asked another whether the

00:14:43.203 --> 00:14:46.023
“sacrificial animal” had arrived yet.

00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:49.770
When he did arrive, he was

00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:51.700
taken to an upstairs room,

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:54.770
and things quickly escalated.

00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:58.750
Khashoggi was told there was an Interpol

00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:01.770
order for his arrest, and he would need

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:04.190
to be brought back to Saudi Arabia.

00:15:05.326 --> 00:15:07.010
Khashoggi asked if he was being

00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:09.470
kidnapped, then one of the

00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:11.820
agents brought out a syringe.

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:15.990
Khashoggi's voice became agitated, and he

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:18.080
asked whether he was going to be drugged.

00:15:19.196 --> 00:15:23.806
This was at 1.33 pm, and it was the last

00:15:23.806 --> 00:15:26.356
thing anyone heard Jamal Khashoggi say.

00:15:27.796 --> 00:15:29.136
It’s thought that he was

00:15:29.136 --> 00:15:31.436
suffocated with a plastic bag.

00:15:32.636 --> 00:15:35.226
And then the forensic surgeon was

00:15:35.226 --> 00:15:38.016
put to work, firing up his bone saw

00:15:38.286 --> 00:15:40.856
and cutting up the body of Saudi

00:15:40.856 --> 00:15:42.776
Arabia’s most famous dissident.

00:15:44.276 --> 00:15:46.196
There are differing opinions as

00:15:46.196 --> 00:15:48.096
to whether Khashoggi was actually

00:15:48.096 --> 00:15:50.236
dead when the dismembering started.

00:15:50.986 --> 00:15:53.296
He was certainly dead when it finished.

00:15:54.396 --> 00:15:57.156
Shortly afterwards, a Saudi agent was

00:15:57.186 --> 00:15:59.616
pictured leaving the consulate, dressed

00:15:59.616 --> 00:16:02.486
up in Khashoggi’s clothes, complete with

00:16:02.486 --> 00:16:05.186
his hat and a fake little goatee beard.

00:16:06.326 --> 00:16:08.736
He went to the famous Blue Mosque,

00:16:09.006 --> 00:16:10.626
before slipping into the bathroom,

00:16:10.986 --> 00:16:12.916
changing back into his own

00:16:12.956 --> 00:16:15.396
clothes and dumping Khashoggi’s.

00:16:16.496 --> 00:16:18.316
As to what happened to Khashoggi’s

00:16:18.326 --> 00:16:20.596
body, there are only a handful

00:16:20.596 --> 00:16:22.216
of people who know the truth.

00:16:23.226 --> 00:16:26.076
Some commentators suggest it was wrapped

00:16:26.086 --> 00:16:28.846
in plastic and taken out of the consulate

00:16:29.026 --> 00:16:32.286
in bags, others that it was dissolved

00:16:32.306 --> 00:16:34.866
in acid in the consulate grounds.

00:16:36.196 --> 00:16:38.853
That very afternoon, when her fiancé

00:16:39.146 --> 00:16:40.736
failed to come out of the consulate,

00:16:40.736 --> 00:16:44.276
Khashoggi’s fiancée, Hatice Cengiz

00:16:44.736 --> 00:16:46.996
immediately called Khashoggi’s Turkish

00:16:47.026 --> 00:16:49.266
journalist friend, pleading for help.

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:54.360
Fortunately, this friend, Yasin Aktay, was

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:57.910
an aide to President Erdogan, so he was

00:16:57.930 --> 00:17:00.210
able to get things moving pretty quickly.

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:03.910
From that moment on, what had

00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:05.610
been a private disappearance

00:17:05.830 --> 00:17:08.310
became an international crisis.

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:11.800
Within hours, Turkish officials

00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:13.710
were quietly alerted that

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:15.350
something was badly wrong.

00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:19.890
CCTV footage showed Jamal Khashoggi

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:22.160
entering the consulate, but

00:17:22.570 --> 00:17:24.140
there was no sign of him leaving.

00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:27.700
And the Turkish police could not

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:30.240
simply walk in and search the building.

00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:32.780
Under international law,

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:35.580
consulates are protected spaces,

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:38.630
and entry requires permission

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:40.320
from the country that runs them.

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:45.210
Saudi officials insisted that Khashoggi

00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:48.300
had left of his own accord, and that

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:50.210
there was nothing to investigate.

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:53.740
For the first few days, Saudi

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:57.010
Arabia stuck rigidly to this line.

00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:00.080
They said Khashoggi had completed

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:02.130
his paperwork and walked out.

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:04.770
Perhaps he might have gone

00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:06.330
elsewhere in Istanbul.

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:08.220
Perhaps he had met someone.

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:11.110
Perhaps he had disappeared voluntarily.

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:15.000
It was an implausible story, but

00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:17.800
it was repeated again and again

00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:20.540
by Saudi officials, almost as if

00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:22.770
repetition alone might make it true.

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:26.200
They thought, perhaps perfectly

00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:28.110
reasonably, that nobody would

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:30.010
ever know what had happened

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:31.630
in the consulate that day.

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:34.720
Turkey, meanwhile, chose

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:36.110
a different strategy.

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:39.090
Rather than confronting Saudi

00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:41.680
Arabia head on, showing its hand,

00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:44.650
Turkish authorities began to leak

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:47.780
information, slowly and deliberately.

00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:51.540
First came confirmation that a team

00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:53.750
of Saudi officials had flown into

00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:55.850
Istanbul on the day of the killing.

00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:59.480
Then CCTV images of the men

00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:00.490
arriving at the airport.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.740
Then hotel records.

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:05.870
Then details of the body double wandering

00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:08.146
through the city dressed as Khashoggi.

00:19:09.170 --> 00:19:11.130
Each leak added another

00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:12.970
crack to the Saudi story.

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:16.920
Turkey never held a press conference

00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:18.680
to announce it had recordings

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:20.630
from inside the consulate, nor

00:19:20.890 --> 00:19:22.700
did it ever publicly release them.

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:27.040
Instead, in mid-October, it allowed

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:29.650
journalists to report that such recordings

00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:32.950
existed, letting Saudi Arabia realise,

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:35.740
slowly and painfully, that every

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:38.490
denial had already been contradicted.

00:19:39.656 --> 00:19:41.246
As the days passed, the

00:19:41.246 --> 00:19:42.856
pressure intensified.

00:19:43.356 --> 00:19:45.506
Journalists, governments, and human

00:19:45.506 --> 00:19:47.816
rights groups demanded answers.

00:19:48.656 --> 00:19:50.896
Business leaders began to pull out

00:19:51.066 --> 00:19:52.996
of Saudi investment conferences.

00:19:53.426 --> 00:19:55.386
Western politicians spoke of

00:19:55.426 --> 00:19:57.806
consequences, even if many

00:19:57.806 --> 00:19:59.716
were careful not to go too far.

00:20:00.966 --> 00:20:03.696
The idea that a man, a public figure,

00:20:04.056 --> 00:20:06.876
could walk into a consulate and simply

00:20:06.876 --> 00:20:10.016
vanish was becoming impossible to ignore.

00:20:11.306 --> 00:20:13.446
After more than two weeks of denial,

00:20:13.896 --> 00:20:16.736
Saudi Arabia finally changed its story.

00:20:17.966 --> 00:20:20.616
On the 20th of October, it admitted

00:20:20.856 --> 00:20:22.806
that Jamal Khashoggi was dead.

00:20:23.906 --> 00:20:26.126
But the explanation it offered

00:20:26.506 --> 00:20:28.286
only raised more questions.

00:20:29.696 --> 00:20:31.746
According to the new version,

00:20:32.196 --> 00:20:34.716
Khashoggi had died during a rogue

00:20:34.756 --> 00:20:36.896
interrogation that had gone wrong.

00:20:37.826 --> 00:20:40.196
The operatives involved, Saudi Arabia

00:20:40.196 --> 00:20:43.216
said, had acted without authorisation.

00:20:44.016 --> 00:20:46.016
Several officials were arrested.

00:20:46.396 --> 00:20:48.426
Senior figures were dismissed.

00:20:49.156 --> 00:20:50.686
The Crown Prince, it was

00:20:50.686 --> 00:20:53.236
stressed, knew nothing about it.

00:20:54.446 --> 00:20:56.276
Few people outside the

00:20:56.276 --> 00:20:57.486
kingdom believed it.

00:20:58.866 --> 00:21:01.466
A spontaneous interrogation doesn’t

00:21:01.476 --> 00:21:03.756
normally involve two private jets,

00:21:03.836 --> 00:21:06.676
a 15-man team, a forensic surgeon,

00:21:06.936 --> 00:21:08.916
and a carefully planned cover story.

00:21:10.316 --> 00:21:12.336
Intelligence agencies around the world

00:21:12.616 --> 00:21:15.546
came to the same conclusion: this

00:21:15.986 --> 00:21:18.046
was not an accident; it was a planned

00:21:18.046 --> 00:21:20.946
killing, sponsored by none other than

00:21:20.946 --> 00:21:23.376
the Crown Prince, Mohammed Bin Salman.

00:21:24.693 --> 00:21:25.943
In the months that followed,

00:21:26.213 --> 00:21:27.433
the fallout continued.

00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:30.830
The CIA concluded that Mohammed

00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:33.350
Bin Salman had almost certainly

00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:34.910
approved the operation.

00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:38.700
A United Nations investigator described

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:41.420
the murder as an extrajudicial killing

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:44.420
for which the Saudi state was responsible.

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:49.540
In response, Saudi Arabia held secret

00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:51.780
trials, sentencing some of the men

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:54.480
involved to prison, while sparing others

00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:56.770
who were closer to the centres of power.

00:21:58.050 --> 00:21:59.830
The proceedings were widely

00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:01.880
dismissed as a whitewash.

00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:06.940
And then, gradually, the world…moved on.

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:10.720
Strategic interests reasserted themselves.

00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:12.770
Arms deals resumed.

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:14.740
Diplomacy softened.

00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:18.340
The United States, under President Trump,

00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:21.350
showed no real interest in weighing in.

00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:23.770
Global leaders who had once

00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:26.310
spoken of pariah status were

00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:28.110
photographed shaking hands again.

00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:31.423
A few years later, the same CEOs

00:22:31.476 --> 00:22:33.630
were back in Riyadh, competing

00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:35.700
for lucrative NEOM contracts.

00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:39.150
Even Turkey, after years of tension,

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:41.550
eventually transferred the remaining

00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:43.690
legal proceedings to Saudi Arabia,

00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:46.090
effectively closing the case.

00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:48.740
Jamal Khashoggi’s body

00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:50.150
was never recovered.

00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:53.170
His fiancée never received the

00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:55.570
documents he went to collect that day.

00:22:56.610 --> 00:22:58.920
And the message sent by his killing

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:01.840
lingered long after the headlines faded.

00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:03.690
A warning to critics.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.570
A demonstration of power.

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:09.380
A reminder that, in the new Saudi Arabia,

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:12.690
there were limits to reform, and crossing

00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:16.520
them could be fatal: Jamal Khashoggi went

00:23:16.570 --> 00:23:18.750
to his consulate to collect a document.

00:23:19.556 --> 00:23:22.570
What he exposed instead was the true

00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:25.690
cost of dissent in the new Saudi Arabia.

00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:30.790
OK, then, that is it for today's episode

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:32.760
on the murder of Jamal Khashoggi,

00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:35.020
and with that comes an end to this

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:37.725
three-part mini-series on MBS and

00:23:37.725 --> 00:23:39.820
the making of modern Saudi Arabia.

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:41.580
I hope it's been an interesting one

00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:43.330
and that you've learnt something new.

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:45.480
As always, I would love to know

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:46.870
what you thought of this episode.

00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:49.260
Saudi Arabia is an increasingly

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:51.570
popular country for this show, so

00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:53.940
to the wonderful Saudi listeners, I

00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:55.770
would especially like to know what

00:23:55.770 --> 00:23:57.140
you thought about this episode,

00:23:57.350 --> 00:23:59.400
and of this mini-series in general.

00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:01.910
What would you like people to know about

00:24:01.910 --> 00:24:04.680
your country, what changes have you seen

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:06.920
in your day-to-day lives, and what are

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:09.110
your hopes and dreams for the future?

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:11.810

I'll catch you in the next episode.
