Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo

00:00:11.237 --> 00:00:16.097
English, the show where you can listen to fascinating stories and learn weird

00:00:16.127 --> 00:00:20.497
and wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.007 --> 00:00:25.447
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is part three of our three-part

00:00:25.447 --> 00:00:29.327
mini-series on the very loose theme of the Ottoman Empire.

00:00:29.857 --> 00:00:35.227
In part one, we talked about the man who ended it all, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk.

00:00:35.697 --> 00:00:42.413
In part two, we learned about the so-called Lion of Ioannina, the Balkan Napoleon, Ali Pasha.

00:00:42.983 --> 00:00:46.543
And today we are going to talk about the island of Cyprus.

00:00:47.043 --> 00:00:52.167
It’s a fascinating story that brings together ancient history, modern history,

00:00:52.407 --> 00:00:58.517
global geopolitics and, of course, the age-old rivalry between Turkey and Greece.

00:00:59.137 --> 00:01:02.817
So, let’s not waste a minute and get right into it.

00:01:04.067 --> 00:01:07.497
The Mediterranean Sea is full of wonderful islands.

00:01:08.107 --> 00:01:12.506
Some of them are tiny, barely more than rocky outcrops,

00:01:12.706 --> 00:01:16.366
while others have been important trading hubs for centuries.

00:01:17.126 --> 00:01:20.816
Almost all of them belong to another country.

00:01:21.706 --> 00:01:27.868
Greece claims almost half of them, Croatia another 15 to 20%.

00:01:28.626 --> 00:01:33.346
The rest are divided between Italy, France, and a

00:01:33.346 --> 00:01:35.966
bunch of other countries surrounding the Mediterranean.

00:01:36.546 --> 00:01:43.556
But there are two exceptions—two islands that are fully independent, sovereign states.

00:01:44.596 --> 00:01:49.756
One is Malta, the small island just south of Sicily that has been

00:01:49.756 --> 00:01:54.266
part of various different empires but is now an independent country.

00:01:55.256 --> 00:02:01.826
Now, one thing not everyone knows about Malta is that it isn’t just one island; there

00:02:01.826 --> 00:02:07.646
are actually five islands: the main one, called Malta, a smaller and sleepier one,

00:02:07.976 --> 00:02:15.096
called Gozo, and three more uninhabited ones, or to get even more technical, one of

00:02:15.096 --> 00:02:20.596
those uninhabited islands has a population of two, so it isn’t technically uninhabited.

00:02:21.106 --> 00:02:29.993
There is a little complexity and rivalry between Malta and Gozo; Gozitans are sometimes thought

00:02:29.993 --> 00:02:36.103
of by their neighbours to be backwards and stubborn, while some Gozitans might consider those

00:02:36.103 --> 00:02:42.693
from the big island to be status-seeking, money-driven and think that they are superior.

00:02:43.493 --> 00:02:48.893
It is more of a friendly rivalry than anything else, and although Malta

00:02:48.933 --> 00:02:53.833
might have its fair share of problems, national integrity is not one of them.

00:02:54.703 --> 00:02:59.893
Almost 2,000 kilometres further east lies the only other independent

00:02:59.913 --> 00:03:04.333
Mediterranean island, the only other island that is a sovereign state.

00:03:05.073 --> 00:03:05.683
Cyprus.

00:03:06.693 --> 00:03:09.903
Cyprus, as you may know, is a lot bigger.

00:03:10.443 --> 00:03:17.453
It is the third largest island in the Mediterranean and is located just under 100 kilometres

00:03:17.503 --> 00:03:24.503
off the southern coast of Turkey and just over 100 kilometres out to sea from Syria and Lebanon.

00:03:25.967 --> 00:03:31.854
And the political situation in Cyprus is not as straightforward as that of Malta.

00:03:32.984 --> 00:03:37.944
There is a country, The Republic of Cyprus, which is an independent

00:03:37.954 --> 00:03:43.324
state, and has been recognised as such by the United Nations since 1960.

00:03:44.184 --> 00:03:47.034
It is part of the European Union, it is part of the United

00:03:47.034 --> 00:03:51.414
Nations, and it is as globally recognised as any other country.

00:03:51.944 --> 00:03:55.834
Well, almost…we’ll get to who doesn’t recognise it later on.

00:03:57.094 --> 00:04:02.464
But the island of Cyrus is not just home to the Republic of Cyprus.

00:04:03.374 --> 00:04:08.214
Depending on who you ask, the island is also home to another country,

00:04:08.604 --> 00:04:13.614
the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, or “Northern Cyprus” for short.

00:04:14.834 --> 00:04:18.394
And this isn’t the only “other” presence on the island.

00:04:18.924 --> 00:04:23.417
Between Northern Cyprus and the Republic of Cyprus is a so-called

00:04:23.477 --> 00:04:27.657
buffer zone administered and controlled by the United Nations.

00:04:28.597 --> 00:04:34.487
And then, in the south, there are two British military bases—territory that is

00:04:34.487 --> 00:04:40.557
still technically British land, a curious modern relic of the British empire.

00:04:41.387 --> 00:04:50.174
So, the question we will be asking ourselves today is…how, why, and what does this all mean?

00:04:51.384 --> 00:04:55.094
To try to understand how Cyprus got itself into this

00:04:55.094 --> 00:04:58.314
situation, we need to wind the clocks back a little.

00:04:59.254 --> 00:05:05.464
For most of its early history, Cyprus was a place that changed hands over and over again.

00:05:05.934 --> 00:05:09.824
It was a place where different cultures came and went.

00:05:10.374 --> 00:05:15.094
The Greeks, the Persians, the Romans, the Byzantines, the Venetians—they

00:05:15.124 --> 00:05:19.484
all controlled Cyprus at different points, leaving their mark on the island.

00:05:20.234 --> 00:05:25.124
But the turning point came in 1571 when the Ottoman

00:05:25.124 --> 00:05:29.294
Empire conquered Cyprus, taking it from the Venetians.

00:05:30.664 --> 00:05:35.884
The Ottomans ruled Cyprus for over 300 years, and during that

00:05:35.884 --> 00:05:40.394
time, Cyprus was governed under something called the millet system.

00:05:41.384 --> 00:05:45.794
What this meant in practice was that Greek Orthodox Christians, who made

00:05:45.794 --> 00:05:50.641
up the majority of the island’s population, were granted some religious and

00:05:50.651 --> 00:05:55.951
administrative authority, but ultimate control remained with the Ottoman rulers.

00:05:57.591 --> 00:06:02.791
And, over time, more and more Turkish settlers arrived on the island.

00:06:03.611 --> 00:06:08.281
Many initially came as soldiers, administrators, or peasants,

00:06:08.491 --> 00:06:12.631
and they would form what became the Turkish Cypriot community.

00:06:13.681 --> 00:06:18.221
For centuries, these two communities, the Turkish Muslim

00:06:18.221 --> 00:06:22.621
Cypriots and the Greek Orthodox Cypriots lived side by side.

00:06:23.021 --> 00:06:25.471
Sometimes peacefully, sometimes not.

00:06:26.351 --> 00:06:31.811
But as the Ottoman Empire started to weaken in the 19th century, as we heard about

00:06:31.811 --> 00:06:36.921
in parts one and two of this mini-series, tensions between them began to grow.

00:06:37.871 --> 00:06:42.241
By the 19th century, nationalism was spreading across the Balkans.

00:06:42.581 --> 00:06:47.211
Greece had won independence from the Ottomans in 1830, and

00:06:47.501 --> 00:06:50.741
other Christian-majority regions were seeking the same.

00:06:51.571 --> 00:06:56.357
Many Greek Cypriots were inspired by Greek nationalism and

00:06:56.401 --> 00:07:00.492
the idea of something called Enosis, a union with Greece.

00:07:01.532 --> 00:07:05.302
And the Ottoman Empire was struggling to maintain control.

00:07:06.222 --> 00:07:11.752
In 1821, a Greek nationalist uprising in Cyprus had been brutally suppressed

00:07:11.762 --> 00:07:16.292
by the Ottomans, who even ended up executing the Archbishop of Cyprus.

00:07:17.242 --> 00:07:22.042
The divide between Greek and Turkish Cypriots continued to deepen.

00:07:22.772 --> 00:07:29.722
Greek Cypriots saw themselves as part of a broader Hellenic identity, while Turkish Cypriots

00:07:29.722 --> 00:07:35.692
began to see themselves as defenders of Ottoman rule, resisting the spread of Greek influence.

00:07:36.302 --> 00:07:39.937
And in 1878, everything changed.

00:07:40.617 --> 00:07:45.717
That was the year the Ottomans handed control of Cyprus over to the British.

00:07:46.787 --> 00:07:47.277
Why?

00:07:47.847 --> 00:07:49.527
Well, it's a good question.

00:07:50.037 --> 00:07:52.447
It was part of an unorthodox deal.

00:07:53.077 --> 00:07:57.027
See, at the time, the Ottomans were at war with Russia.

00:07:57.827 --> 00:08:03.077
The British, sensing the opportunity to establish a naval base and protect

00:08:03.077 --> 00:08:08.967
its route to India, offered the Ottomans a deal: Britain would defend the

00:08:08.987 --> 00:08:13.767
Ottomans against Russia in exchange for administrative control of Cyprus.

00:08:14.857 --> 00:08:18.457
On paper, Cyprus was to remain part of the Ottoman

00:08:18.457 --> 00:08:22.647
Empire, and the Sultan would still be the nominal ruler.

00:08:23.427 --> 00:08:27.947
But in reality, Britain governed Cyprus as a colony.

00:08:28.957 --> 00:08:33.945
It introduced English-style administration, taxation, and infrastructure

00:08:33.945 --> 00:08:38.585
projects, though it kept most other elements of Ottoman governance intact.

00:08:39.835 --> 00:08:45.305
This was the beginning of Cyprus shifting from Ottoman rule to British control.

00:08:46.005 --> 00:08:51.345
And then, in 1914, when the Ottoman Empire joined World War I on the side of

00:08:51.405 --> 00:08:56.875
Germany, Britain formally annexed Cyprus and made it part of the British Empire.

00:08:58.375 --> 00:09:02.225
At first, many Greek Cypriots welcomed this change.

00:09:03.035 --> 00:09:06.045
They thought it would bring them one step closer to

00:09:06.045 --> 00:09:10.235
their ultimate goal—”Enosis”, or union with Greece.

00:09:11.015 --> 00:09:13.885
For many Greek Cypriots, it was their dream.

00:09:14.865 --> 00:09:17.935
Now, Enosis wasn’t just about geography.

00:09:18.575 --> 00:09:22.375
After all, Cyprus is much closer geographically to Turkey,

00:09:22.845 --> 00:09:26.355
it’s even closer to Iraq than it is to mainland Greece.

00:09:27.015 --> 00:09:29.285
Enosis was about identity.

00:09:30.235 --> 00:09:34.245
Greek Cypriots had always considered themselves culturally Greek,

00:09:34.613 --> 00:09:38.766
and traced their roots back to ancient Hellenic civilisation.

00:09:39.381 --> 00:09:43.051
They spoke Greek, followed the Greek Orthodox Church,

00:09:43.281 --> 00:09:47.331
and saw themselves as part of the broader Greek world.

00:09:48.371 --> 00:09:53.141
And this idea, the idea of Enosis, gained momentum in the 19th

00:09:53.161 --> 00:09:57.841
century, especially after Greece gained independence in 1830.

00:09:59.051 --> 00:10:02.181
As more Greek-majority regions broke away from the

00:10:02.181 --> 00:10:06.111
Ottomans, Greek Cypriots felt they should be next.

00:10:06.951 --> 00:10:13.731
To them, Cyprus was only under Ottoman and later British rule by historical accident.

00:10:14.331 --> 00:10:18.751
The fact that it was physically closer to Turkey or the rest of the Middle East

00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:25.368
didn’t matter—what mattered was that their language, religion, and culture were Greek.

00:10:26.668 --> 00:10:34.038
But for the Turkish Cypriots, this idea of unification with Greece was a terrifying prospect.

00:10:35.218 --> 00:10:39.738
Turkish Cypriots had always been a minority in Cyprus, and

00:10:39.988 --> 00:10:44.068
this push for Enosis made them feel even more vulnerable.

00:10:44.938 --> 00:10:48.608
They feared that if Cyprus became part of Greece, they would

00:10:48.618 --> 00:10:52.988
lose political power completely and become second-class citizens.

00:10:53.738 --> 00:10:58.818
Greek Cypriots might even force them to leave Cyprus, just as the Greeks

00:10:58.948 --> 00:11:03.378
had expelled Muslims from newly independent Greece in the 19th century.

00:11:04.218 --> 00:11:09.176
And violence might erupt, as it had in other nationalist uprisings in the Balkans.

00:11:10.106 --> 00:11:15.706
For decades, these tensions and fears bubbled under the surface.

00:11:16.276 --> 00:11:20.676
But by the 1950s, things started to explode.

00:11:21.506 --> 00:11:26.254
In 1955, a Greek Cypriot nationalist group called

00:11:26.284 --> 00:11:30.554
EOKA launched an armed rebellion against British rule.

00:11:31.514 --> 00:11:37.757
Their goal was simple—end British rule and unite Cyprus with Greece.

00:11:38.767 --> 00:11:41.047
The British, of course, resisted.

00:11:41.327 --> 00:11:45.697
They deployed troops, arrested rebels, and imposed curfews.

00:11:46.417 --> 00:11:50.407
But as the violence escalated, something else happened.

00:11:51.097 --> 00:11:55.017
The conflict was no longer just about Cyprus and Britain.

00:11:55.487 --> 00:11:59.897
It was also about Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots.

00:12:00.707 --> 00:12:04.087
The Turkish Cypriot community, fearing that Enosis would

00:12:04.087 --> 00:12:07.617
leave them powerless, started forming their own militias.

00:12:08.157 --> 00:12:14.777
They called for partition—a permanent division of the island into separate Greek and Turkish zones.

00:12:15.417 --> 00:12:21.557
Sensing the imminent complications, Britain became increasingly reluctant to hold onto Cyprus.

00:12:22.507 --> 00:12:29.117
This was the 1950s, and across the world, the British Empire was shrinking fast.

00:12:29.667 --> 00:12:32.847
India had gained independence in 1947.

00:12:33.061 --> 00:12:38.487
Ghana had become independent in 1957—the first African country to do so.

00:12:39.307 --> 00:12:43.557
Even across the Mediterranean, the previously British crown colony of

00:12:43.557 --> 00:12:48.927
Malta was pushing for independence, and it would be granted in 1964.

00:12:49.867 --> 00:12:54.527
Britain was reassessing its empire, and Cyprus, with its

00:12:54.547 --> 00:12:58.860
growing unrest, was becoming more of a burden than an asset.

00:12:59.607 --> 00:13:02.747
By 1960, Britain had had enough.

00:13:03.467 --> 00:13:09.027
Cyprus was granted independence but under a very fragile power-sharing

00:13:09.037 --> 00:13:13.447
agreement, where the President was Greek Cypriot, and the Vice President

00:13:13.487 --> 00:13:18.507
was Turkish Cypriot, each with veto power over national decisions.

00:13:19.879 --> 00:13:25.509
Cyprus was independent, but the British didn’t simply pack up and go home.

00:13:26.168 --> 00:13:33.191
As part of the deal, to ensure tensions didn’t immediately flare up, it kept two military bases

00:13:33.381 --> 00:13:39.261
in the south of the island, military bases which remain British territory to this very day.

00:13:40.111 --> 00:13:46.761
And importantly, Greece, Turkey, and Britain were named as “Guarantor Powers,”

00:13:47.061 --> 00:13:52.431
meaning they had the right to intervene if Cyprus’ independence was ever threatened.

00:13:53.611 --> 00:13:56.591
It was supposed to be a compromise.

00:13:57.291 --> 00:14:00.261
Instead, it was a ticking time bomb.

00:14:01.461 --> 00:14:05.401
By 1974, Cyprus was in crisis.

00:14:06.171 --> 00:14:12.201
A group of Greek nationalists, backed by the military junta in Athens, staged a coup

00:14:12.519 --> 00:14:18.439
to overthrow the Cypriot government and force Enosis, force unification with Greece.

00:14:18.937 --> 00:14:23.377
They overthrew the President and installed a pro-Enosis government.

00:14:24.166 --> 00:14:30.574
Turkey saw this as a direct violation of the 1960 agreement, which had given Turkey,

00:14:30.594 --> 00:14:35.454
Greece, and Britain the right to intervene if Cyprus’ independence was threatened.

00:14:36.441 --> 00:14:42.592
This seemed like exactly that kind of situation, and within days, the Turkish military

00:14:42.762 --> 00:14:48.122
launched an invasion, claiming it was to protect the Turkish Cypriot minority.

00:14:48.662 --> 00:14:54.232
This invasion came in two parts, and Turkish troops did not just secure

00:14:54.282 --> 00:14:58.862
Turkish Cypriot areas—they launched a full-scale military operation.

00:14:59.682 --> 00:15:05.182
The Turkish army quickly occupied 37% of the island, pushing Greek

00:15:05.182 --> 00:15:09.552
Cypriots out of the north and displacing tens of thousands of people.

00:15:10.562 --> 00:15:14.690
A ceasefire was declared, but the damage was done.

00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:17.690
The island was now divided in two.

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:23.280
Before this, Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots had both

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:27.710
lived in most areas of the island, often happily side by side.

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:34.170
Yes, some areas were more Greek and others were more Turkish, but it was relatively mixed.

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:40.016
After the ceasefire, a line was drawn through the island, with the northeastern

00:15:40.016 --> 00:15:44.996
part of the island becoming the Turkish bit, the southwestern part becoming

00:15:44.996 --> 00:15:50.436
the Greek bit, and the capital, Nicosia, being split down the middle.

00:15:51.656 --> 00:15:59.096
In 1983, the Turkish-controlled north declared itself the “Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.”

00:16:00.276 --> 00:16:06.866
The only country that recognises it as a valid nation-state is, surprise, surprise, Turkey.

00:16:07.606 --> 00:16:12.706
The Republic of Cyprus, in the south, remains the internationally recognised government.

00:16:13.414 --> 00:16:14.771
And in between them?

00:16:15.171 --> 00:16:18.041
A UN Buffer Zone, patrolled by peacekeepers.

00:16:18.901 --> 00:16:25.281
It stretches 180 km across the island, from west to east, and varies in

00:16:25.281 --> 00:16:30.521
width—from a few metres in Nicosia to several kilometres in rural areas.

00:16:31.611 --> 00:16:39.161
And to this day, the island remains divided, and its future is a complex and delicate subject.

00:16:40.312 --> 00:16:44.122
Different proposals have been made as to the future of the island.

00:16:45.162 --> 00:16:49.662
One is some kind of federation, where Cyprus would become a

00:16:49.672 --> 00:16:54.772
single nation-state but with autonomous Greek and Turkish zones.

00:16:55.846 --> 00:17:00.662
Another is a full two-state solution, which would formalise the

00:17:00.682 --> 00:17:05.802
current status and recognise Northern Cyprus as an independent country.

00:17:07.232 --> 00:17:11.502
And another is a full unification, where the line is

00:17:11.502 --> 00:17:15.542
scrapped, and Cyprus becomes a united island once more.

00:17:16.652 --> 00:17:22.842
There was, as you may know, a referendum on one of these proposals in 2004.

00:17:24.102 --> 00:17:29.672
It was called the Annan plan, and was a UN-backed project to give the people

00:17:29.672 --> 00:17:35.702
of Cyprus the choice to form a single, united Cyprus, but with two separate

00:17:35.742 --> 00:17:40.462
administrations that would handle daily governance of the two different regions.

00:17:41.652 --> 00:17:43.532
It was put to a referendum.

00:17:44.472 --> 00:17:51.222
It was supported by 65% of Turkish Cypriots, who felt that this would give them the

00:17:51.222 --> 00:17:57.112
legitimacy that they'd longed for, as well as putting some distance between them and Turkey.

00:17:58.632 --> 00:18:02.102
However, it was resoundingly rejected by Greek

00:18:02.102 --> 00:18:06.362
Cypriots, with 76% of the population voting against it.

00:18:07.362 --> 00:18:11.272
It was seen as giving too many concessions to the Turkish population,

00:18:11.672 --> 00:18:15.932
giving the Turkish Cypriot state equal political status despite being

00:18:15.932 --> 00:18:21.222
a smaller population, and creating a “worse of both worlds” situation.

00:18:21.972 --> 00:18:30.322
What the majority of Greek Cypriots wanted was a full unification, a united, not a divided, island.

00:18:30.942 --> 00:18:37.132
This has been the biggest attempt to resolve the issue to date, and it failed miserably.

00:18:37.992 --> 00:18:42.612
The state of Cyprus in 2025 is as precarious as ever.

00:18:43.422 --> 00:18:47.662
Tens of thousands of Greek Cypriots still have homes in the north,

00:18:47.962 --> 00:18:52.712
properties that their families have been unable to return to since 1974.

00:18:53.539 --> 00:19:00.313
Nicosia Airport, the former main airport on the island, lies deserted, a relic frozen in

00:19:00.313 --> 00:19:06.093
time, unable to be used amicably by both sides since the invasion more than 50 years ago.

00:19:07.571 --> 00:19:11.671
And while this unusual division of an island might seem

00:19:11.671 --> 00:19:15.528
like a mere historical curiosity, it is anything but.

00:19:16.768 --> 00:19:22.158
As you may know, or as you might remember from one of our first-ever episodes on who

00:19:22.188 --> 00:19:28.919
owns the sea, a country can claim economic rights over the waters up to 200 nautical

00:19:28.919 --> 00:19:35.402
miles from its coast, forming what is known as an Exclusive Economic Zone, or EEZ.

00:19:36.077 --> 00:19:38.737
And this is where things get complicated.

00:19:39.067 --> 00:19:45.327
The waters off Cyprus almost certainly contain valuable oil and gas reserves, making the

00:19:45.327 --> 00:19:53.707
question of who governs Cyprus not just a matter of history, but of economics, energy, and power.

00:19:54.921 --> 00:20:00.841
Under international law, the Republic of Cyprus has declared an EEZ covering

00:20:00.851 --> 00:20:05.466
almost 100,000 square kilometres around the island, and it has signed

00:20:05.466 --> 00:20:10.496
agreements with Egypt, Israel, and Lebanon to delineate maritime borders.

00:20:11.206 --> 00:20:14.916
American, French, and Israeli companies have already begun

00:20:14.956 --> 00:20:18.936
exploratory work, hunting for valuable natural gas reserves.

00:20:19.456 --> 00:20:26.036
But there’s a problem, or a few big problems, to be precise: Turkey

00:20:26.301 --> 00:20:32.395
doesn’t recognise Cyprus as a state, doesn’t recognize its EEZ, and isn’t a

00:20:32.415 --> 00:20:38.015
signatory of UNCLOS, the international treaty that governs maritime borders.

00:20:38.995 --> 00:20:46.265
And Turkey isn't just rejecting Cyprus’ claims on paper—it has actively challenged them at sea.

00:20:47.385 --> 00:20:54.505
Turkish naval vessels have escorted drilling ships into waters claimed by Cyprus, arguing that

00:20:54.515 --> 00:21:00.695
Greek Cypriots have no right to explore for energy without the consent of Turkish Cypriots.

00:21:01.825 --> 00:21:08.415
At the same time, Turkey argues that islands like Cyprus and Crete should not be able to claim

00:21:08.415 --> 00:21:15.275
a full 200-nautical-mile EEZ if they are close to a continental mainland, in this case, Turkey.

00:21:16.675 --> 00:21:22.135
This is not just a theoretical debate for diplomats in Brussels and Ankara,

00:21:22.325 --> 00:21:26.945
of men and women in suits not shaking each other’s hands at global events.

00:21:27.395 --> 00:21:29.445
It has real-world consequences.

00:21:30.685 --> 00:21:36.285
In 2020, tensions between Greece and Turkey boiled over when a

00:21:36.295 --> 00:21:41.145
Greek navy frigate collided with a Turkish warship south of Crete.

00:21:42.275 --> 00:21:46.045
The incident happened as the Turkish survey vessel, which was

00:21:46.305 --> 00:21:50.875
escorted by warships, entered disputed waters claimed by Greece.

00:21:52.155 --> 00:21:59.565
The Greek navy dispatched ships to observe, a tense standoff ensued, and at one point, a

00:21:59.575 --> 00:22:05.965
Greek frigate made a manoeuvre that resulted in a minor collision with the Turkish warship.

00:22:06.515 --> 00:22:09.915
Now, the Greeks say the Turkish ship was acting

00:22:09.915 --> 00:22:13.485
aggressively and that the Greek one simply stood its ground.

00:22:13.995 --> 00:22:17.825
The Turks say it was Greece that provoked the situation.

00:22:18.735 --> 00:22:22.275
Fortunately, diplomacy prevented things from escalating further.

00:22:22.785 --> 00:22:30.055
But it was yet another reminder of how volatile the Eastern Mediterranean is—and how the division of

00:22:30.055 --> 00:22:37.329
Cyprus is not just a problem of the past, but a flashpoint that could trigger a much larger crisis.

00:22:38.099 --> 00:22:42.439
So, to wrap things up, this small island remains one

00:22:42.439 --> 00:22:45.669
of the most geopolitically complex places in the world.

00:22:46.319 --> 00:22:50.729
Cyprus is one of the world’s longest-running frozen conflicts.

00:22:51.029 --> 00:22:55.059
Every attempt at reunification has failed, yet no one

00:22:55.069 --> 00:22:57.729
is willing to fully accept permanent division either.

00:22:58.419 --> 00:23:01.269
Will the two sides ever find common ground?

00:23:01.719 --> 00:23:05.789
Or will the Green Line remain a permanent scar across the island?

00:23:06.579 --> 00:23:12.259
Who knows, but what seems clear is that this issue grows more important by the day.

00:23:14.239 --> 00:23:17.539
OK then, that’s it for today’s episode on Cyprus.

00:23:17.829 --> 00:23:20.119
I hope it was an interesting one, and that you’ve learned

00:23:20.119 --> 00:23:23.396
something new about this fascinating but troubled island.

00:23:23.879 --> 00:23:26.739
As always, I’d love to hear what you thought about this episode.

00:23:27.089 --> 00:23:29.769
For the Greeks, the Turks, or even the Cypriots among

00:23:29.769 --> 00:23:33.199
you, what does the future hold for the island of Cyprus?

00:23:33.609 --> 00:23:40.119
Unification, division, or a continuation of the current, slightly unpredictable, status quo?

00:23:40.715 --> 00:23:43.939
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.
