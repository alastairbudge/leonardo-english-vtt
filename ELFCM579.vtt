Hello, hello, hello, and welcome

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:09.930
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.809
Minds, by Leonardo English, the show

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.640
where you can listen to fascinating

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.270
stories and learn weird and wonderful

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.360
things about the world at the same

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.160
time as improving your English.

00:00:21.629 --> 00:00:24.650
I'm Alastair Budge, and today it’s

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.830
part three of our three-part series

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.160
on the theme of “university”.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.580
In case you missed them, in part

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.610
one we talked about the history

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.589
of universities in general.

00:00:37.099 --> 00:00:38.999
In part two, we talked about

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.660
how university works in the UK.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.750
And today, we’re saving the best for

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.870
last, or worst for last, you could argue.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.370
It’s the story of Trump University,

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:53.850
a university that has been called

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:56.259
“a total fraud”, “an absolute

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.409
scam”, and not a university at all.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.110
So, let’s not waste a minute

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.180
and get right into it.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.930
You might know the expression “there’s

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.810
no such thing as a free lunch”.

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:13.960
It means that nothing in life is free,

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:17.339
and is thought to come from the American

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.840
practice of bars offering a “free

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.300
lunch”, but only if you buy a drink.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.710
It’s a classic sales tactic: offer

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.920
something for free, but really

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.330
it comes with a catch, a hidden

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.979
opportunity to sell you something else.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.675
It’s something we all know about,

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.970
whether that’s downloading a “free

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.650
ebook”, registering for a “free

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.500
webinar” or joining a “free training”.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.259
It’s almost never really free.

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.300
But sometimes it sounds so

00:01:51.309 --> 00:01:53.120
appealing, and you never know,

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.680
this one might be different.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.789
In the late 2000s, all over the

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.290
United States, people started

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.460
seeing adverts for something that

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.330
sounded almost too good to be true.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.760
Donald Trump, then two seasons into

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.780
The Apprentice and the self-declared

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.600
“without question, the world’s most famous

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.329
businessman”, the billionaire real-estate

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.939
developer, was promising to spill the

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.750
beans, to share his secrets of success.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.690
He was launching Trump University,

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.690
a university in which students

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.450
would learn how to make it big not

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.140
just in the world of real estate,

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.900
but in the world of business.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.550
It was a ticket to wealth and success.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.269
And the best bit?

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.260
There was a free 90-minute

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.850
seminar you could attend.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.720
Free.

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.230
Zero dollars.

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:57.329
You just needed to register

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:59.720
and come along for 90 minutes.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.239
Thousands of excited potential students

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.880
attended, piling into hotel conference

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.240
rooms to learn from the master.

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.600
As they entered the conference, they

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.740
could see they were in the right place.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.130
The Trump name was all over the place,

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:18.760
as well as pictures of The Donald,

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.350
complete with the trademark “I mean

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:23.680
business” look, coiffured blonde

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.010
hair, red tie and expensive suit.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.570
Yes, this was a seminar for

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.250
Trump University, all right.

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.569
The real Donald Trump was nowhere

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.569
to be seen, but that was ok.

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:40.969
It was a seminar led by his

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.079
hand-picked experts; he was not just

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.130
a successful businessman, he was the

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.589
world’s most famous businessman, he

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.489
couldn’t come to all of these events.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.709
The lights dimmed, and

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:55.326
the seminar started.

00:03:56.424 --> 00:04:00.460
It was 90 minutes of…well, not a lot.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.350
There was a promotional video in which

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.660
Donald Trump boasted about how this

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.829
university was going to be better than

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.049
the best business schools in the country,

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.190
and he knew because he had been to the

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:14.640
best business school in the country.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.219
It was going to take

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:19.050
less time and cost less.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.390
It would be better, quicker, and

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.928
cheaper, the holy triumvirate.

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:29.229
The 90-minute seminar itself didn’t

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.270
teach you very much, and the person

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.550
giving the presentation didn’t seem

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.010
to be particularly knowledgeable

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.090
about the world of real estate.

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.520
What was clear, however, was

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.200
what they wanted you to do next.

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:47.169
To take the next step on your

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.380
journey to wealth and success,

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.939
there was a three-day seminar.

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.910
This wasn’t free; it was

00:04:55.121 --> 00:04:59.880
$1,495, but it wasn’t a cost.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.720
It was an investment in your future.

00:05:03.429 --> 00:05:05.870
If you weren’t prepared to invest in

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.040
yourself and if you weren’t prepared

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.500
to learn from Donald Trump and his

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.599
hand-picked professors, well, as Trump

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.739
himself put it in the promotional

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:17.849
video, “you’re just not going to make

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.970
it in terms of the world of success”.

00:05:21.429 --> 00:05:24.419
It sounded, well, convincing enough

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:27.190
for thousands of people to take action.

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.690
For a mere $1,495, they could

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.420
take this first step, which

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.260
was this three-day seminar.

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.490
And in fact, as a special bonus, this

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:43.919
three-day seminar included a “free” ticket

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:46.370
for a friend, so really, if you were

00:05:46.549 --> 00:05:49.722
splitting the cost, it was only $750.

00:05:50.162 --> 00:05:51.599
A veritable bargain.

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.580
But when the day came, and they

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.969
yet again arrived at the designated

00:05:57.969 --> 00:05:59.950
hotel conference room, what

00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:02.279
they found was more of the same.

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.900
Not much real estate training at all, no

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.740
Donald Trump, and a lot of promotional

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.520
and marketing material talking about

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:14.490
how wonderful their life would be after

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:17.460
taking the next step at Trump University.

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:21.060
This three-day seminar wasn’t,

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:22.780
after all, the final step.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.770
During those three days, they

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:27.980
were told about the next stages.

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:30.920
There was a series of “elite”

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.200
packages that attendees could choose

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.090
from: Bronze, Silver, and Gold.

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:41.919
Bronze was only $9,995, Silver

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:50.936
was $19,495, and Gold was $34,995.

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:54.249
You didn’t get all that much with

00:06:54.259 --> 00:06:57.440
Bronze, but if you were prepared to

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:02.229
shell out the full $35,000 for the Gold

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.840
package, you got access to a bunch of

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:07.460
retreats and seminars, as well as one

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:10.099
year of mentorship from one of Trump’s

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:12.679
hand-picked real estate professionals

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:17.129
and access to Trump’s private deals.

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.950
In fact, the entire three-day seminar,

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:23.700
which, let’s not forget, people had paid

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:27.010
$1,500 for the pleasure of attending,

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:30.550
was essentially a sales pitch for

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:33.169
these higher-priced elite packages.

00:07:34.459 --> 00:07:38.060
Over the 72-hour period, representatives

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:41.270
from the university mingled among

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:44.080
attendees, flattering them for taking

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.240
the initiative, and congratulating

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.120
them on what was no doubt going

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:50.660
to be a lucrative and long career

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:53.480
in real estate, if they chose the

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:55.359
appropriate elite package, that was.

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:59.090
After all, the cost of a package was

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:01.760
minimal, considering the value you’d

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:04.039
get out of it, and the money you’d make.

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:06.570
It wasn’t a cost; it was an

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:09.450
investment, an investment that your

00:08:09.459 --> 00:08:11.770
future self would thank you for.

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:16.840
And thousands of people did take the

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:21.159
next step, paying up to $35,000 for

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:23.430
the most expensive “Gold” package.

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.589
And what did they get?

00:08:27.379 --> 00:08:30.540
Well, even for those who had shelled

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:34.030
out tens of thousands of dollars, many

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:36.260
would later report that they didn’t

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:37.970
receive what they had been promised.

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:41.879
The retreats and seminars seemed

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:43.570
to be further opportunities to

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:46.310
be upsold, pressurised to buy

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:48.100
additional packages and products.

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:51.819
The mentorship was non-existent,

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.790
and the real estate data they

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:57.360
were given was public information.

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:02.225
It was, to quote Marco Rubio, the former

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.950
Trump critic, but now fierce ally and

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:07.890
Secretary of State, “a complete sham”.

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:10.189
There was nothing there.

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:14.250
Now, selling a “get-rich-quick

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:17.039
scheme” might be immoral and

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:21.090
shady, but it isn’t illegal per se.

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:25.209
The business model of Trump University, of

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:28.260
the free seminar, upselling to one product

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:31.140
before upselling again to a more expensive

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.620
one, is still one that's in use today.

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:36.230
Immoral it certainly may

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:38.810
be but illegal it is not.

00:09:39.709 --> 00:09:41.920
The problem with Trump University

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:43.950
was that it made several,

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:46.590
perhaps unnecessary, errors.

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:50.180
The first was with language.

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:53.380
In the United States, like in many

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:55.979
countries, it is the government that

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:58.470
decides what can call itself a university.

00:09:59.139 --> 00:10:02.839
The word means something, and for an

00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:05.470
educational institution to call itself

00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:08.570
a university, it needs authorisation.

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:11.900
Trump University didn’t have this.

00:10:13.179 --> 00:10:15.590
The second problem was also related to

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:18.790
language, and it was that he promised

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:21.620
there would be “professors and adjunct

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:24.620
professors”. If something isn’t a

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:27.620
real university, it can’t claim it has

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:30.630
professors. I cannot suddenly declare

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:33.090
someone to be a professor at Leonardo

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:36.189
English University, and nor could Donald

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.570
Trump declare one of his staff members

00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:41.359
to be a “professor at Trump University”.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.970
And the third problem was to

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:46.680
do with these “professors”.

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:50.219
In the promotional video, Trump

00:10:50.299 --> 00:10:52.579
boasted that these “best of the

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:54.620
best” professors were all people

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:57.870
who were hand-picked by him, which

00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.790
of course was a big selling point.

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:02.819
Trump was the main attraction; he was

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:07.450
the definition of success, and if he had

00:11:07.639 --> 00:11:10.490
personally chosen all the instructors,

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:13.200
well, that was immensely valuable.

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:16.850
The problem, it would later transpire,

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:20.320
was that he hadn’t hand-picked anyone.

00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:23.360
When he was presented with a list of

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:25.849
names of people who had “taught” at the

00:11:25.849 --> 00:11:28.610
university, giving seminars to people who

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:31.209
had paid tens of thousands of dollars, in

00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:33.650
many cases, he didn’t know who they were.

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:38.413
This all came to light in 2013,

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:41.089
after the State of New York filed

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:43.329
a civil lawsuit against Trump

00:11:43.339 --> 00:11:46.060
University for “illegal business

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:49.209
practices”, essentially misrepresenting

00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:50.819
what customers were buying.

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:54.579
Trump countered, with lawyers showing

00:11:54.579 --> 00:11:56.640
documents that the university had a

00:11:56.650 --> 00:12:01.069
98% student satisfaction rate, and even

00:12:01.069 --> 00:12:04.620
building a website, 98percentapproval.com.

00:12:06.096 --> 00:12:08.416
As part of the court process,

00:12:08.786 --> 00:12:11.466
Trump University had to hand over

00:12:11.476 --> 00:12:14.256
a bunch of documents to support its

00:12:14.256 --> 00:12:16.916
claims and counter the allegation

00:12:17.156 --> 00:12:18.976
of illegal business practices.

00:12:20.166 --> 00:12:21.956
And what came out in the

00:12:21.956 --> 00:12:24.316
process was…enlightening.

00:12:25.776 --> 00:12:28.716
In terms of the 98% approval claim,

00:12:29.246 --> 00:12:31.406
prosecutors did admit that the

00:12:31.406 --> 00:12:34.606
number looked correct, but on closer

00:12:34.636 --> 00:12:37.336
inspection, something seemed fishy.

00:12:38.136 --> 00:12:40.196
Students who had given the course

00:12:40.206 --> 00:12:43.266
four or five stars, on a five-point

00:12:43.286 --> 00:12:46.576
scale, often left negative feedback,

00:12:46.966 --> 00:12:48.876
criticising the course, the

00:12:48.876 --> 00:12:51.296
instructors, and the high-pressured

00:12:51.296 --> 00:12:52.776
sales environment around it.

00:12:53.566 --> 00:12:55.596
It seemed strange for someone who

00:12:55.596 --> 00:12:58.266
was clearly unhappy with a product

00:12:58.656 --> 00:13:00.036
to give it such a high rating.

00:13:01.316 --> 00:13:04.246
What’s more, they looked at the refund

00:13:04.246 --> 00:13:06.878
rate on the programme, and found that

00:13:06.878 --> 00:13:10.276
32% of people who went to the three-day

00:13:10.286 --> 00:13:13.776
seminar and 16% of people who bought

00:13:13.776 --> 00:13:16.686
the gold package requested a refund.

00:13:18.226 --> 00:13:20.566
Something didn’t seem to add up.

00:13:21.096 --> 00:13:25.146
If 32% of people request a refund, how

00:13:25.146 --> 00:13:28.266
can 98% of people say it was fantastic?

00:13:29.686 --> 00:13:32.186
It was almost as if they were only

00:13:32.226 --> 00:13:34.506
asking selected students to leave

00:13:34.506 --> 00:13:37.096
their feedback, pushing people hard

00:13:37.146 --> 00:13:39.586
to leave five-star reviews, or just

00:13:39.766 --> 00:13:41.846
fudging the numbers altogether.

00:13:43.416 --> 00:13:46.056
And in the document discovery

00:13:46.076 --> 00:13:49.136
process, Trump University was forced

00:13:49.146 --> 00:13:51.956
to hand over its internal documents.

00:13:52.856 --> 00:13:55.746
What emerged was that it was really

00:13:55.756 --> 00:13:58.126
much more of a sales organisation

00:13:58.446 --> 00:14:00.786
than an educational institution.

00:14:01.596 --> 00:14:04.596
The “staff” at the seminars were

00:14:04.596 --> 00:14:06.916
essentially sales-representatives,

00:14:07.246 --> 00:14:09.226
and they were tasked with pushing

00:14:09.556 --> 00:14:11.986
as many people as possible towards

00:14:11.986 --> 00:14:14.446
the expensive, “elite” packages.

00:14:15.956 --> 00:14:19.476
The 172-page internal handbook

00:14:19.866 --> 00:14:21.696
detailed some of the tactics they

00:14:21.696 --> 00:14:24.716
used and they were illuminating.

00:14:25.946 --> 00:14:28.826
One section was dedicated to handling

00:14:28.876 --> 00:14:31.286
objections, which are of course an

00:14:31.286 --> 00:14:32.916
important part of any sales job.

00:14:33.566 --> 00:14:36.676
But at Trump University, things

00:14:36.716 --> 00:14:38.966
were taken to their extreme.

00:14:40.126 --> 00:14:43.346
For someone who said that $35,000 was

00:14:43.356 --> 00:14:45.726
a lot of money, they were encouraged

00:14:45.746 --> 00:14:48.256
not to think about the $35,000 number,

00:14:48.736 --> 00:14:51.126
but rather only on the interest

00:14:51.136 --> 00:14:53.716
payments on their credit card, and of

00:14:53.756 --> 00:14:55.786
course they were all recommended to

00:14:55.786 --> 00:14:57.626
take out credit to pay for the course.

00:14:58.436 --> 00:15:00.986
For someone who asked about success

00:15:00.986 --> 00:15:03.586
guarantees, they were told to tell the

00:15:03.586 --> 00:15:05.856
prospect that they would be given all the

00:15:05.856 --> 00:15:09.296
tools and information for success, but the

00:15:09.336 --> 00:15:12.026
only thing stopping them was themselves.

00:15:12.806 --> 00:15:14.696
And for someone who suggested they

00:15:14.696 --> 00:15:17.016
were considering Trump University as

00:15:17.016 --> 00:15:19.166
well as other real estate investing

00:15:19.166 --> 00:15:21.616
schemes, they were reminded of Donald

00:15:21.616 --> 00:15:23.766
Trump’s personal success and wealth,

00:15:24.316 --> 00:15:27.486
and told–and I’m quoting directly–”Don't

00:15:27.516 --> 00:15:30.036
buy a Kia when you can have a Bentley.”

00:15:31.556 --> 00:15:34.246
But all of this would eventually

00:15:34.276 --> 00:15:36.416
catch up with Trump University.

00:15:37.496 --> 00:15:39.556
The legal problems started in

00:15:39.556 --> 00:15:42.716
2013, with the Attorney General of

00:15:42.716 --> 00:15:44.856
New York filing a lawsuit against

00:15:44.856 --> 00:15:46.746
the institution, accusing Trump

00:15:46.756 --> 00:15:49.596
University of “persistent fraudulent,

00:15:49.933 --> 00:15:52.216
illegal and deceptive conduct.”

00:15:53.356 --> 00:15:55.626
And it wasn’t just New York.

00:15:56.426 --> 00:15:58.716
Two separate class-action lawsuits

00:15:58.906 --> 00:16:01.476
were filed in California, representing

00:16:01.556 --> 00:16:04.556
thousands of former students who claimed

00:16:04.566 --> 00:16:07.836
they had been misled and left tens of

00:16:07.846 --> 00:16:09.966
thousands of dollars out of pocket.

00:16:10.946 --> 00:16:13.966
The allegations were simple, but damning:

00:16:14.546 --> 00:16:17.316
Trump University wasn’t a real university.

00:16:17.686 --> 00:16:19.016
Its so-called professors

00:16:19.256 --> 00:16:20.596
weren’t professors at all.

00:16:21.316 --> 00:16:23.636
And the promises of mentorship,

00:16:24.056 --> 00:16:26.406
exclusive property listings, and

00:16:26.446 --> 00:16:29.146
insider access were simply false.

00:16:30.916 --> 00:16:33.106
As you might imagine, Donald Trump

00:16:33.206 --> 00:16:36.056
consistently denied any wrongdoing.

00:16:36.696 --> 00:16:38.686
He kept coming back to that alleged

00:16:38.686 --> 00:16:41.456
98% approval rating, and when he

00:16:41.456 --> 00:16:43.576
decided to run for president, he

00:16:43.576 --> 00:16:46.566
continued this defence, even insisting

00:16:46.806 --> 00:16:49.156
that he would never settle the case.

00:16:50.366 --> 00:16:53.326
And yet, just days after being

00:16:53.356 --> 00:16:54.796
elected President of the United

00:16:54.806 --> 00:16:56.866
States, he did exactly that.

00:16:57.536 --> 00:17:00.676
He agreed to settle all three cases for

00:17:00.766 --> 00:17:05.016
$25 million, all without admitting guilt.

00:17:06.356 --> 00:17:08.516
For the thousands of former students,

00:17:08.836 --> 00:17:10.896
the settlement meant they would

00:17:10.896 --> 00:17:13.186
finally get some of their money back.

00:17:14.186 --> 00:17:16.416
For Trump, it meant the lawsuits

00:17:16.646 --> 00:17:18.626
would not hang over his presidency.

00:17:19.726 --> 00:17:23.126
And, for better or for worse, it worked,

00:17:23.606 --> 00:17:26.056
or at least it has been so outdone by

00:17:26.116 --> 00:17:28.136
everything else that has happened since

00:17:28.136 --> 00:17:30.766
then that it’s nowhere near the top of a

00:17:30.766 --> 00:17:32.886
list of scandals involving Donald Trump.

00:17:33.896 --> 00:17:36.926
Now, to wrap things up, the story of

00:17:36.926 --> 00:17:39.916
Trump University is, on one level,

00:17:40.206 --> 00:17:42.006
simply another “get rich quick”

00:17:42.006 --> 00:17:44.856
scheme, a classic upsell funnel

00:17:45.036 --> 00:17:47.176
dressed up with glossy marketing.

00:17:47.836 --> 00:17:49.656
Plenty of companies have used

00:17:49.666 --> 00:17:51.736
similar tactics, plenty of people

00:17:52.056 --> 00:17:54.256
have fallen for them, and plenty

00:17:54.256 --> 00:17:56.496
of people still do fall for them.

00:17:57.376 --> 00:17:59.416
But what made it a little

00:17:59.416 --> 00:18:01.036
different was the name.

00:18:02.066 --> 00:18:04.366
Donald Trump’s entire pitch was

00:18:04.366 --> 00:18:07.376
based on the power of his brand: “I

00:18:07.606 --> 00:18:09.236
am the most successful businessman

00:18:09.236 --> 00:18:11.936
in the world, and if you learn from

00:18:11.936 --> 00:18:14.426
me, you too can be successful.”

00:18:15.526 --> 00:18:18.446
That promise, that proximity to Trump

00:18:18.696 --> 00:18:20.896
meant proximity to wealth, was what

00:18:20.926 --> 00:18:23.766
persuaded thousands of ordinary Americans

00:18:23.906 --> 00:18:26.646
to part with their savings, to take out

00:18:26.646 --> 00:18:29.486
loans, in some cases loans that they

00:18:29.486 --> 00:18:31.856
are still paying off to this very day.

00:18:32.956 --> 00:18:35.436
Compared to a “real” university,

00:18:35.936 --> 00:18:39.266
there is a stark irony here, and an

00:18:39.266 --> 00:18:41.336
even greater one if we go back to

00:18:41.336 --> 00:18:43.376
the very first days of universities.

00:18:44.466 --> 00:18:47.456
To bring it back to the very start, as you

00:18:47.456 --> 00:18:49.826
may remember, the University of Bologna

00:18:50.096 --> 00:18:53.276
made no promises to its students, and the

00:18:53.276 --> 00:18:56.616
courses in grammar, rhetoric and logic

00:18:56.876 --> 00:18:59.326
were perhaps as far as you could get from

00:18:59.536 --> 00:19:02.366
vocational, practical business advice.

00:19:03.216 --> 00:19:06.426
Yet in reality, they prepared these

00:19:06.426 --> 00:19:08.746
young scholars perfectly for the

00:19:08.756 --> 00:19:11.116
careers they would go on to have in

00:19:11.126 --> 00:19:14.076
the church, in law, or in government.

00:19:15.266 --> 00:19:17.826
With Trump University, the entire

00:19:17.846 --> 00:19:19.766
premise was about giving people

00:19:19.766 --> 00:19:21.906
the skills they needed not just for

00:19:21.926 --> 00:19:25.036
professional success, but for vast wealth.

00:19:26.226 --> 00:19:28.526
And yet, for most of the people who

00:19:28.526 --> 00:19:31.306
attended, it taught nothing of the sort.

00:19:32.596 --> 00:19:35.366
According to a former sales manager at

00:19:35.366 --> 00:19:38.376
Trump University, “To my knowledge, not

00:19:38.416 --> 00:19:41.106
a single consumer who paid for a Trump

00:19:41.126 --> 00:19:43.706
University seminar program went on to

00:19:43.746 --> 00:19:46.326
successfully invest in real estate based

00:19:46.326 --> 00:19:47.896
on the techniques that were taught”

00:19:49.246 --> 00:19:51.336
In the end, Trump University

00:19:51.596 --> 00:19:53.766
lasted barely seven years.

00:19:54.556 --> 00:19:57.706
It collected an estimated $40 million

00:19:57.706 --> 00:20:00.886
in fees, returned $25 million in

00:20:00.886 --> 00:20:03.086
settlements, and the company was

00:20:03.116 --> 00:20:05.916
officially dissolved in 2017.

00:20:06.816 --> 00:20:08.496
Compare that to the University of

00:20:08.496 --> 00:20:11.486
Bologna, which has lasted almost 1,000

00:20:11.486 --> 00:20:14.846
years, or almost any other of the tens

00:20:14.846 --> 00:20:17.066
of thousands of “official” universities

00:20:17.076 --> 00:20:19.156
worldwide that are still educating

00:20:19.166 --> 00:20:20.826
millions of students every year.

00:20:21.726 --> 00:20:23.686
It’s a reminder that words

00:20:23.686 --> 00:20:25.706
matter, and so does substance.

00:20:26.106 --> 00:20:27.926
You can call something a university,

00:20:28.256 --> 00:20:30.416
you can plaster it with the pictures

00:20:30.436 --> 00:20:32.416
of a famous businessman, you can

00:20:32.416 --> 00:20:35.066
fill a glossy brochure with promises,

00:20:35.306 --> 00:20:37.346
but if there’s nothing behind it,

00:20:37.586 --> 00:20:39.186
it won’t last a very long time.

00:20:40.576 --> 00:20:43.206
Perhaps what students of Trump University

00:20:43.516 --> 00:20:45.896
should have studied was the sales

00:20:45.896 --> 00:20:48.236
tactics of the organisation itself.

00:20:48.936 --> 00:20:51.526
It was clearly very efficient at

00:20:51.526 --> 00:20:53.876
separating vulnerable people from their

00:20:53.886 --> 00:20:56.636
hard-earned money, and had even made

00:20:56.796 --> 00:21:00.036
a 172-page handbook on how to do it.

00:21:01.106 --> 00:21:03.546
Unfortunately, that was a lesson

00:21:03.776 --> 00:21:05.536
that Trump University “graduates”

00:21:05.746 --> 00:21:07.456
would have to learn the hard way.

00:21:09.026 --> 00:21:11.136
OK, then, that is it for today's

00:21:11.136 --> 00:21:13.676
episode on Trump University, and with

00:21:13.676 --> 00:21:15.726
that comes the end of this three-part

00:21:15.726 --> 00:21:18.096
mini-series on the theme of “university”.

00:21:18.716 --> 00:21:19.956
I hope it's been an interesting one

00:21:20.246 --> 00:21:21.886
and that you've learnt something new.

00:21:22.596 --> 00:21:24.226
As always, I would love to know

00:21:24.226 --> 00:21:26.496
what you thought of this episode and

00:21:26.496 --> 00:21:28.196
from this mini-series in general.

00:21:28.506 --> 00:21:30.206
Have you ever fallen for a

00:21:30.216 --> 00:21:32.456
“get-rich-quick” scheme, or are there

00:21:32.466 --> 00:21:34.656
similar things in your country? What

00:21:34.656 --> 00:21:36.506
was your experience of university

00:21:36.506 --> 00:21:38.476
like and how could it have been

00:21:38.476 --> 00:21:40.546
better? I would love to know, so

00:21:40.746 --> 00:21:42.446
let’s get this discussion started.

00:21:42.816 --> 00:21:43.916
You can head right into our

00:21:43.916 --> 00:21:45.516

00:21:48.186 --> 00:21:50.396
chatting away to other curious minds.

00:21:51.216 --> 00:21:53.106
You've been listening to English Learning

00:21:56.236 --> 00:21:59.066
