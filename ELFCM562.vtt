Hello, hello, hello, and welcome

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.809
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.580
Minds, by Leonardo English, the show

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:14.330
where you can listen to fascinating

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.740
stories and learn weird and wonderful

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.720
things about the world at the same

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.480
time as improving your English.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.040
I'm Alastair Budge, and today it’s part

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.090
three of our three-part mini-series on

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.160
the subject of citizenship and identity.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.519
In case you missed it, in part

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:34.820
one, we talked about who can and

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.990
can’t become an Italian citizen.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.230
In part two, we talked about the Windrush

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.390
Scandal, where tens of thousands of

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.290
people in Britain, who had lived in the

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.550
country for decades and believed they were

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.039
British, were suddenly told they were not.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.349
And in this episode, we are going to

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.620
talk about the small Mediterranean

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.239
island of Malta, and its battle with

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.360
the European Union over its right

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.720
to continue selling its passports.

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.180
If you are a seriously dedicated listener

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.789
to this show, you might remember us

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.890
touching on this subject in episode

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.500
number 42, back in 2020, but today we

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.440
are going to go a lot deeper and talk

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.210
about how things have evolved since then.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.970
So let’s not waste a minute,

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:22.880
and get right into it.

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:26.680
So far in this mini-series, we’ve

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.460
explored some of the ways in which an

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.120
individual becomes a citizen of a country.

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:34.820
They can be born there, they can

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.160
have parents or grandparents who are

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.210
citizens of that country, they can

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.270
marry someone from that country, they

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.429
can live in and contribute to that

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:46.180
country for a certain time, after which

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.029
they can apply to become a citizen.

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:51.720
For the vast majority of the world’s

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.060
population, one or more of these will

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.929
be the routes through which they have

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:59.408
acquired citizenship or citizenships.

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:02.750
But there are also countries that

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.399
offer a shortcut, countries that

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.380
offer their passports to people who

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.830
don’t want to wait, people who want

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.210
a citizenship now, and are prepared

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.609
to pay handsomely for the privilege.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.049
These are the countries that sell

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:21.870
their passports, or to give them their

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.359
technical name, countries that offer

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.390
“citizenship by investment” schemes.

00:02:28.482 --> 00:02:30.542
Typically, these are small

00:02:30.572 --> 00:02:32.962
countries, often islands, which

00:02:32.962 --> 00:02:35.072
will offer citizenship in exchange

00:02:35.082 --> 00:02:37.792
for a cash donation or some kind

00:02:37.792 --> 00:02:39.672
of investment in the country.

00:02:40.932 --> 00:02:42.882
The first country to start offering

00:02:42.882 --> 00:02:45.502
it was the Caribbean island nation

00:02:45.722 --> 00:02:47.832
of Saint Kitts and Nevis, which

00:02:47.872 --> 00:02:50.602
launched its scheme in 1984.

00:02:51.952 --> 00:02:54.292
It offered citizenship of Saint Kitts

00:02:54.302 --> 00:02:56.612
and Nevis, along with low tax rates,

00:02:56.962 --> 00:02:59.172
in exchange for a cash payment.

00:02:59.942 --> 00:03:01.432
You didn’t even have to set foot

00:03:01.462 --> 00:03:04.192
in the country, but, for a fee, of

00:03:04.192 --> 00:03:06.452
course, you could become a citizen.

00:03:07.632 --> 00:03:10.722
And if you’re wondering who was and

00:03:10.792 --> 00:03:13.502
is buying these passports, and for

00:03:13.502 --> 00:03:16.122
what reason, it’s typically wealthy

00:03:16.132 --> 00:03:19.132
individuals looking for three main things.

00:03:20.182 --> 00:03:22.652
Firstly, greater travel freedom.

00:03:23.662 --> 00:03:26.362
A passport from Saint Kitts and Nevis

00:03:26.642 --> 00:03:29.632
gives visa-free access to over 150

00:03:29.632 --> 00:03:32.152
countries, including the UK and much

00:03:32.152 --> 00:03:34.732
of Europe, which is a big deal for

00:03:34.732 --> 00:03:37.762
someone from, say, China or Russia,

00:03:38.062 --> 00:03:40.162
where they might need visas, or they

00:03:40.162 --> 00:03:42.522
might not be allowed to enter at all.

00:03:43.212 --> 00:03:45.342
Second, tax advantages.

00:03:46.112 --> 00:03:48.232
Saint Kitts has no income or

00:03:48.232 --> 00:03:50.965
capital gains tax for citizens, so

00:03:51.245 --> 00:03:53.415
it can be a legal way for the very

00:03:53.415 --> 00:03:55.445
rich to reduce their tax bills.

00:03:56.655 --> 00:03:58.485
Third, a safety net.

00:03:59.375 --> 00:04:02.025
For people from unstable countries,

00:04:02.185 --> 00:04:04.795
places with shaky economies, or simply

00:04:04.815 --> 00:04:06.585
countries where the government can come

00:04:06.585 --> 00:04:09.175
along one day and seize all your assets,

00:04:09.545 --> 00:04:12.125
a second passport is like an insurance

00:04:12.155 --> 00:04:15.445
policy, a quick exit if things go south.

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.379
And for the country that sold

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:21.379
these passports, the benefit

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.849
was clear: cold, hard cash.

00:04:25.857 --> 00:04:28.602
It costs practically nothing to print a

00:04:28.642 --> 00:04:31.192
passport and add a name to a database,

00:04:31.592 --> 00:04:34.242
and if there is no residency requirement,

00:04:34.452 --> 00:04:37.192
no need for the individual to come there

00:04:37.192 --> 00:04:40.132
or buy property, the effect on the local

00:04:40.132 --> 00:04:42.752
population is minimal: no complaints

00:04:42.752 --> 00:04:44.702
about foreigners increasing property

00:04:44.702 --> 00:04:47.232
prices or changing the local environment.

00:04:48.562 --> 00:04:51.202
And the fees paid by these foreigners,

00:04:51.392 --> 00:04:53.672
or I should say newly minted fellow

00:04:53.672 --> 00:04:56.712
citizens, these can be used for everything

00:04:56.712 --> 00:04:59.722
from schools to hospitals to pensions.

00:05:00.442 --> 00:05:03.042
Given this, after the first scheme

00:05:03.052 --> 00:05:04.992
in Saint Kitts and Nevis was launched

00:05:05.012 --> 00:05:07.932
in 1984, many other countries

00:05:08.142 --> 00:05:10.432
followed suit, offering their own

00:05:10.632 --> 00:05:12.742
citizenship by investment schemes.

00:05:13.872 --> 00:05:16.802
Soon enough, a wealthy person could choose

00:05:16.802 --> 00:05:19.355
from a suite of different countries, like

00:05:19.485 --> 00:05:22.015
wandering down a supermarket aisle and

00:05:22.245 --> 00:05:24.315
looking at the various offers on sale.

00:05:25.852 --> 00:05:29.472
And fast forward to 2014, the

00:05:29.492 --> 00:05:31.622
tiny Mediterranean island of Malta

00:05:31.869 --> 00:05:34.529
made a splash by launching its own

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:36.889
scheme that didn’t just get you any

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:39.509
passport, it got you a passport to

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:41.789
a country in the European Union.

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:46.059
Now, importantly, Malta wasn’t the

00:05:46.059 --> 00:05:49.939
first EU country to launch a CBI-type

00:05:49.939 --> 00:05:52.679
scheme; Ireland launched a similar

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:55.909
scheme in 1988, but it was a little

00:05:55.929 --> 00:05:58.579
different, and it wasn’t a great success.

00:06:00.179 --> 00:06:01.809
Malta’s was different.

00:06:03.079 --> 00:06:05.489
Firstly, it was a question of timing.

00:06:06.109 --> 00:06:07.799
There were simply a lot more people

00:06:07.989 --> 00:06:10.279
who could afford and who wanted to buy

00:06:10.309 --> 00:06:14.699
passports in 2014 than there were in 1988.

00:06:15.599 --> 00:06:17.329
Whether we are talking about China

00:06:17.329 --> 00:06:20.009
or Saudi Arabia or India, or even

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:22.362
Russia, the market for people who

00:06:22.362 --> 00:06:24.402
could spend six-figure sums on

00:06:24.422 --> 00:06:26.862
citizenship was considerably larger

00:06:27.092 --> 00:06:28.692
when Malta launched its scheme.

00:06:30.012 --> 00:06:32.832
What’s more, the EU element was more

00:06:32.832 --> 00:06:36.162
valuable in 2014 than in the 1990s.

00:06:36.882 --> 00:06:39.422
When Ireland launched its programme,

00:06:39.772 --> 00:06:41.682
there were only 12 countries in the

00:06:41.692 --> 00:06:44.902
EU; when Malta did, there were 28.

00:06:46.412 --> 00:06:49.092
And importantly, having a passport

00:06:49.342 --> 00:06:52.202
to an EU country means that you have

00:06:52.302 --> 00:06:55.032
visa-free travel to any other country

00:06:55.032 --> 00:06:57.522
in the EU, which is a large bonus

00:06:57.752 --> 00:06:59.842
for a wealthy individual who likes

00:06:59.842 --> 00:07:02.272
the idea of trotting between Milan

00:07:02.272 --> 00:07:04.672
and Paris and perhaps the odd weekend

00:07:04.672 --> 00:07:06.962
trip to Stockholm or Barcelona.

00:07:07.772 --> 00:07:09.602
You also have the right to live

00:07:09.882 --> 00:07:12.822
in any EU country, so by getting

00:07:12.842 --> 00:07:14.962
a Maltese passport, you can live

00:07:14.962 --> 00:07:17.472
somewhere more desirable, like the

00:07:17.472 --> 00:07:19.832
south of France or a Tuscan villa.

00:07:20.842 --> 00:07:23.412
And secondly, the Malta scheme had

00:07:23.412 --> 00:07:26.042
some very slick marketing behind it.

00:07:26.782 --> 00:07:29.142
A company called Henley and Partners

00:07:29.312 --> 00:07:32.262
went around the globe selling passports

00:07:32.422 --> 00:07:34.932
on behalf of Malta, and collecting

00:07:34.932 --> 00:07:37.072
a healthy commission in the process.

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:40.522
A 4% commission, by the way, on the

00:07:40.542 --> 00:07:44.352
cost of a minimum of €700,000, which

00:07:44.352 --> 00:07:46.212
would typically rise to almost a

00:07:46.212 --> 00:07:48.412
million Euros by the time everything

00:07:48.422 --> 00:07:49.962
else was taken into account.

00:07:51.402 --> 00:07:53.792
Now, you might be thinking “who would

00:07:53.792 --> 00:07:55.782
pay a million Euros for a passport?”,

00:07:56.292 --> 00:07:58.962
but the answer is “a lot of people”.

00:08:00.172 --> 00:08:02.642
The scheme was officially capped at

00:08:02.642 --> 00:08:06.282
1,800 main applicants, which is the

00:08:06.312 --> 00:08:08.662
classic marketing ploy of creating

00:08:08.662 --> 00:08:10.732
scarcity to encourage people to

00:08:10.742 --> 00:08:14.302
take action, and in 10 years, almost

00:08:14.332 --> 00:08:16.252
all of those places were sold.

00:08:17.362 --> 00:08:19.722
Including dependents–so partners

00:08:19.742 --> 00:08:23.642
and children–a total of 5,300 people

00:08:23.889 --> 00:08:25.852
were granted Maltese citizenship,

00:08:26.162 --> 00:08:28.002
which brought in an estimated

00:08:28.022 --> 00:08:31.532
€1.6 billion to the country.

00:08:32.282 --> 00:08:34.669
That might not be all that much for a

00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:37.542
larger country, but for a small country

00:08:37.542 --> 00:08:40.282
like Malta, with a population of less than

00:08:40.282 --> 00:08:42.992
half a million, it equated to more than

00:08:42.992 --> 00:08:47.352
€3,000 for every man, woman and child.

00:08:48.452 --> 00:08:51.032
Yes, not all of this money reached

00:08:51.032 --> 00:08:53.072
the average person in Malta, and

00:08:53.252 --> 00:08:54.862
there are widespread allegations

00:08:54.872 --> 00:08:57.222
of corruption and cronyism, with

00:08:57.222 --> 00:08:59.672
politicians and businesspeople siphoning

00:08:59.682 --> 00:09:01.442
off large chunks for themselves.

00:09:01.932 --> 00:09:04.052
But it did mean that the government

00:09:04.062 --> 00:09:06.222
was able to start offering things like

00:09:06.222 --> 00:09:09.132
free childcare and make improvements to

00:09:09.132 --> 00:09:11.552
the healthcare and education systems.

00:09:12.975 --> 00:09:15.395
Now, the scheme in Malta was

00:09:15.425 --> 00:09:17.335
slightly stricter than that of

00:09:17.335 --> 00:09:19.055
Saint Kitts and Nevis, for example.

00:09:19.955 --> 00:09:22.465
There was a theoretical requirement

00:09:22.475 --> 00:09:25.505
for you to “live” in Malta, but in

00:09:25.505 --> 00:09:27.785
practice this meant you either had

00:09:27.785 --> 00:09:29.975
a buy an apartment worth at least

00:09:29.975 --> 00:09:35.605
€350,000 or rent one for €1,300 a month.

00:09:36.535 --> 00:09:38.355
If you are already paying almost a

00:09:38.355 --> 00:09:40.795
million Euros for a passport, another

00:09:40.805 --> 00:09:45.365
€1,300 is pocket change, and what this

00:09:45.365 --> 00:09:48.155
meant was that there were and still are

00:09:48.465 --> 00:09:50.635
hundreds of apartments in Malta that

00:09:50.635 --> 00:09:53.070
were rented out purely for the purpose

00:09:53.305 --> 00:09:55.565
of meeting this “residency requirement”.

00:09:57.035 --> 00:09:59.975
I lived in Malta for 7 years, for

00:09:59.985 --> 00:10:02.915
reasons entirely unrelated to passports

00:10:02.915 --> 00:10:05.875
or citizenship, I should add, and my

00:10:05.885 --> 00:10:08.465
former landlord had two apartments

00:10:08.675 --> 00:10:10.545
that he rented out to foreigners.

00:10:11.725 --> 00:10:13.305
One was to us.

00:10:14.055 --> 00:10:15.805
We were pretty good tenants, I

00:10:15.835 --> 00:10:18.315
think, but there was the occasional

00:10:18.315 --> 00:10:20.225
problem: the dishwasher broke

00:10:20.225 --> 00:10:22.085
or something needed to be fixed.

00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:24.195
You know, normal stuff that

00:10:24.195 --> 00:10:26.295
happens in any rented apartment.

00:10:27.255 --> 00:10:29.865
But he preferred his other tenants,

00:10:29.975 --> 00:10:31.865
who rented the apartment opposite us.

00:10:32.765 --> 00:10:35.085
They were far less demanding because they

00:10:35.085 --> 00:10:36.935
didn’t actually live in the apartment.

00:10:37.525 --> 00:10:39.535
They had never even seen it; the

00:10:39.535 --> 00:10:42.115
place was completely empty, but

00:10:42.425 --> 00:10:44.045
they paid their rent every month,

00:10:44.265 --> 00:10:46.655
so they had the paperwork to “prove”

00:10:46.885 --> 00:10:48.845
their so-called residency in Malta.

00:10:50.285 --> 00:10:52.375
Now, you might think this is all

00:10:52.445 --> 00:10:54.875
perfectly fair, and that a country

00:10:54.885 --> 00:10:56.925
has the right to decide who it gives

00:10:56.935 --> 00:10:59.765
citizenship to, and under what conditions.

00:11:00.645 --> 00:11:02.655
You might think that it’s awful, and

00:11:02.885 --> 00:11:05.005
that citizenship should be about more

00:11:05.005 --> 00:11:07.385
than bank transfers and signatures

00:11:07.555 --> 00:11:09.495
in air-conditioned conference rooms.

00:11:10.635 --> 00:11:13.005
Someone, or rather something,

00:11:13.315 --> 00:11:15.025
that firmly took the latter

00:11:15.025 --> 00:11:17.285
position, was the European Union

00:11:18.785 --> 00:11:21.439
The EU’s objection wasn’t immediate,

00:11:22.005 --> 00:11:24.485
and Malta wasn’t trying to hide

00:11:24.525 --> 00:11:26.135
this scheme, quite the opposite.

00:11:27.195 --> 00:11:29.915
But as Malta’s programme gathered

00:11:29.915 --> 00:11:33.625
pace after its 2014 launch, concerns

00:11:33.815 --> 00:11:35.555
started to grow in Brussels.

00:11:36.795 --> 00:11:38.995
From the EU’s perspective, the

00:11:38.995 --> 00:11:42.145
problem was simple: while every

00:11:42.145 --> 00:11:44.225
member state has the sovereign right

00:11:44.495 --> 00:11:46.715
to decide who gets its citizenship,

00:11:47.272 --> 00:11:49.732
EU citizenship is automatically

00:11:49.752 --> 00:11:51.962
attached to national citizenship.

00:11:52.792 --> 00:11:54.912
The moment someone becomes Maltese,

00:11:55.382 --> 00:11:57.692
they also become European, with

00:11:57.692 --> 00:12:00.702
the right to live, work, and travel

00:12:00.712 --> 00:12:03.472
freely across 27 other countries.

00:12:04.842 --> 00:12:07.182
So, when Malta was selling its

00:12:07.202 --> 00:12:09.062
passports, it wasn’t just selling

00:12:09.082 --> 00:12:11.092
access to Malta, it was selling

00:12:11.112 --> 00:12:14.212
access to the entire European Union.

00:12:15.412 --> 00:12:17.682
At first, the European Commission

00:12:17.972 --> 00:12:20.512
expressed what you might call gentle

00:12:20.562 --> 00:12:23.072
unease about the scheme, with the

00:12:23.072 --> 00:12:24.702
occasional politician making a

00:12:24.722 --> 00:12:27.092
passing comment about it or mentioning

00:12:27.282 --> 00:12:28.832
how it should be looked into.

00:12:29.852 --> 00:12:32.162
But as the number of applicants grew,

00:12:32.682 --> 00:12:35.152
and as questions were raised about

00:12:35.162 --> 00:12:37.312
how thoroughly applicants were being

00:12:37.312 --> 00:12:40.862
vetted, the concerns became more serious.

00:12:41.942 --> 00:12:45.242
In 2017, a particularly strong light was

00:12:45.242 --> 00:12:48.112
shone on Malta after the assassination

00:12:48.312 --> 00:12:50.622
of the investigative journalist Daphne

00:12:50.622 --> 00:12:53.432
Caruana Galizia, who was, among other

00:12:53.432 --> 00:12:55.842
things, looking into allegations of

00:12:55.862 --> 00:12:57.922
political corruption specifically

00:12:57.922 --> 00:13:00.292
related to sales of passports.

00:13:01.452 --> 00:13:04.352
In 2018, the European Parliament

00:13:04.572 --> 00:13:06.642
passed a resolution calling on

00:13:06.652 --> 00:13:08.762
member states to phase out both

00:13:08.772 --> 00:13:11.242
citizenship and residence-by-investment

00:13:11.242 --> 00:13:13.662
programmes, warning that they posed

00:13:13.692 --> 00:13:15.922
risks related to money laundering,

00:13:16.312 --> 00:13:18.272
tax evasion, and security.

00:13:19.532 --> 00:13:23.052
The pressure kept mounting, and in October

00:13:23.222 --> 00:13:26.512
of 2020, the European Commission formally

00:13:26.522 --> 00:13:28.502
launched infringement proceedings against

00:13:28.502 --> 00:13:32.172
Malta, accusing it of violating EU law.

00:13:33.419 --> 00:13:35.812
At this point, Brussels wasn’t

00:13:35.812 --> 00:13:37.422
just politely expressing its

00:13:37.422 --> 00:13:39.832
disapproval; it was starting legal

00:13:39.872 --> 00:13:41.952
action against a member state.

00:13:43.272 --> 00:13:46.062
Malta, for its part, pushed back.

00:13:46.742 --> 00:13:49.092
It argued that deciding who becomes

00:13:49.092 --> 00:13:51.482
a citizen is a matter of national

00:13:51.492 --> 00:13:54.332
sovereignty, something that EU treaties

00:13:54.512 --> 00:13:57.402
leave entirely up to member states.

00:13:58.662 --> 00:14:01.242
But behind the scenes, the government

00:14:01.282 --> 00:14:02.872
also began to make changes.

00:14:03.692 --> 00:14:06.912
In late 2020, Malta officially closed

00:14:06.932 --> 00:14:09.132
its original Individual Investor

00:14:09.132 --> 00:14:11.532
Programme and introduced a new

00:14:11.532 --> 00:14:14.052
version, the Maltese Exceptional

00:14:14.052 --> 00:14:16.072
Investor Naturalisation Programme.

00:14:17.312 --> 00:14:20.142
On paper, this new scheme was stricter.

00:14:20.792 --> 00:14:22.982
Applicants now needed to establish

00:14:22.982 --> 00:14:26.342
residency for either 12 or 36 months,

00:14:26.512 --> 00:14:28.032
depending on the size of their payment,

00:14:28.412 --> 00:14:30.492
and the government claimed to have

00:14:30.492 --> 00:14:33.249
strengthened its due diligence processes.

00:14:34.329 --> 00:14:36.572
But critics, including the European

00:14:36.572 --> 00:14:38.672
Commission, argued that these

00:14:38.672 --> 00:14:40.792
changes were largely cosmetic.

00:14:41.652 --> 00:14:43.992
After all, wealthy individuals could

00:14:43.992 --> 00:14:46.392
still buy their way to Maltese citizenship

00:14:46.582 --> 00:14:49.202
in just over a year, often without

00:14:49.232 --> 00:14:51.282
any genuine connection to the country.

00:14:52.302 --> 00:14:54.692
They were still selling passports, it

00:14:54.692 --> 00:14:56.482
was now just a little harder to buy them.

00:14:57.662 --> 00:14:59.782
And there were more leaks.

00:15:00.402 --> 00:15:03.482
In 2021, an investigation called

00:15:03.562 --> 00:15:06.162
the Passport Papers revealed that

00:15:06.192 --> 00:15:07.802
applicants to the Malta passport

00:15:07.802 --> 00:15:09.982
scheme said they only planned to

00:15:09.982 --> 00:15:13.005
spend an average of 16 days in the

00:15:13.005 --> 00:15:15.795
country, and that this was considered

00:15:15.795 --> 00:15:17.955
sufficient by the Maltese government

00:15:18.155 --> 00:15:20.845
to qualify for “12 months residency”.

00:15:22.145 --> 00:15:24.505
Clearly, the Maltese authorities had

00:15:24.505 --> 00:15:26.405
been well-advised when creating the

00:15:26.405 --> 00:15:29.135
scheme to add this “12-month residency

00:15:29.135 --> 00:15:31.415
requirement”, so as to be able to claim

00:15:31.415 --> 00:15:33.475
to the EU that these people were genuine

00:15:33.475 --> 00:15:37.095
residents, but these leaked emails showed

00:15:37.095 --> 00:15:38.775
that people didn’t really have to spend

00:15:38.815 --> 00:15:40.525
any significant time in the country,

00:15:40.905 --> 00:15:42.985
they just had to pretend they did.

00:15:44.285 --> 00:15:47.005
And so, pressure continued to build,

00:15:47.145 --> 00:15:49.255
and the legal battle continued.

00:15:50.145 --> 00:15:53.855
In 2022, the European Commission escalated

00:15:53.875 --> 00:15:56.445
the case by issuing what’s called a

00:15:56.495 --> 00:15:59.425
reasoned opinion, which is the next formal

00:15:59.425 --> 00:16:02.065
step in infringement proceedings, and

00:16:02.065 --> 00:16:04.565
warned Malta that if it didn’t shut the

00:16:04.565 --> 00:16:07.385
programme down entirely, the case would be

00:16:07.385 --> 00:16:09.935
referred to the European Court of Justice.

00:16:11.505 --> 00:16:14.815
And in mid-2023, that’s exactly what

00:16:14.815 --> 00:16:17.645
happened: the dispute landed at the

00:16:17.685 --> 00:16:21.205
EU’s highest court, and in April of

00:16:21.205 --> 00:16:24.225
2025, the court gave its decision.

00:16:24.785 --> 00:16:28.145
The scheme is in violation of EU law,

00:16:28.705 --> 00:16:31.885
and–to quote directly–it "amounts to

00:16:31.895 --> 00:16:34.145
rendering the acquisition of nationality

00:16:34.405 --> 00:16:36.575
a mere commercial transaction".

00:16:37.465 --> 00:16:39.265
In other words, something that should

00:16:39.275 --> 00:16:41.505
be about true connection–whether

00:16:41.505 --> 00:16:43.305
that’s through blood, living in a

00:16:43.305 --> 00:16:45.325
country for an extended period, or

00:16:45.325 --> 00:16:47.815
through marriage–this is reduced to

00:16:47.815 --> 00:16:50.455
just another product with a price tag.

00:16:51.832 --> 00:16:53.952
So, what comes next?

00:16:54.382 --> 00:16:56.692
Well, as of the time of recording

00:16:56.692 --> 00:16:59.032
this episode, not much has changed.

00:16:59.432 --> 00:17:01.752
The Henley & Partners website currently

00:17:01.752 --> 00:17:04.282
reads, “The Malta Citizenship by

00:17:04.282 --> 00:17:06.752
Naturalisation for Exceptional Services

00:17:06.752 --> 00:17:09.232
by Direct Investment process is no

00:17:09.232 --> 00:17:12.062
longer accepting new applications”, but

00:17:12.522 --> 00:17:14.492
there has been no official announcement.

00:17:15.302 --> 00:17:18.122
Malta has said it’ll examine the

00:17:18.122 --> 00:17:21.372
findings, and most likely it will find

00:17:21.372 --> 00:17:23.822
a way to challenge the EU’s decision.

00:17:24.792 --> 00:17:27.222
The country may be forced to shut

00:17:27.262 --> 00:17:29.622
its programme down permanently, and

00:17:29.852 --> 00:17:32.222
this decision could also effectively

00:17:32.232 --> 00:17:34.752
block any other EU country from

00:17:34.762 --> 00:17:36.742
launching a similar scheme in future.

00:17:38.062 --> 00:17:40.062
And that, ultimately, gets to the

00:17:40.062 --> 00:17:41.732
heart of the entire controversy.

00:17:42.402 --> 00:17:44.312
Is citizenship something that

00:17:44.312 --> 00:17:46.132
countries should be able to sell?

00:17:46.682 --> 00:17:49.082
Is it simply another product in a global

00:17:49.082 --> 00:17:51.762
market, like real estate or stocks?

00:17:52.162 --> 00:17:54.582
Or, as the European Union argues,

00:17:54.952 --> 00:17:57.502
is it something much deeper, tied

00:17:57.512 --> 00:18:00.622
to rights, responsibilities, and the

00:18:00.622 --> 00:18:02.902
shared values of a political union?

00:18:04.042 --> 00:18:07.242
Malta’s case may seem small and

00:18:07.242 --> 00:18:09.762
insignificant–a tiny island selling

00:18:09.762 --> 00:18:12.252
a few thousand passports–but the

00:18:12.252 --> 00:18:14.332
questions it raises are ones that

00:18:14.402 --> 00:18:16.952
every country, and every union of

00:18:16.952 --> 00:18:19.562
countries, are being forced to confront.

00:18:21.442 --> 00:18:23.472
OK, then, that is it for today's

00:18:23.472 --> 00:18:25.632
episode on Malta’s battle with the

00:18:25.632 --> 00:18:28.092
EU to sell passports, and with that

00:18:28.262 --> 00:18:30.532
comes an end to this mini-series on

00:18:30.532 --> 00:18:33.022
the theme of citizenship and identity.

00:18:33.652 --> 00:18:34.882
I hope it's been an interesting one

00:18:35.172 --> 00:18:36.622
and that you've learnt something new.

00:18:37.162 --> 00:18:38.862
As always, I would love to know

00:18:38.872 --> 00:18:40.032
what you thought of this episode

00:18:40.272 --> 00:18:42.012
and of this mini-series in general.

00:18:42.472 --> 00:18:44.452
Do you think an EU country should

00:18:44.452 --> 00:18:46.222
have full control over who it

00:18:46.222 --> 00:18:48.062
grants passports to, and how?

00:18:48.602 --> 00:18:50.882
If you have become a citizen of another

00:18:50.882 --> 00:18:53.952
country, do you truly feel like you belong

00:18:53.962 --> 00:18:56.662
in that country, and what is your story?

00:18:57.702 --> 00:18:59.300
I would love to know, and I’ll be

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:01.280
happy to share my own experience too.

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:02.480
