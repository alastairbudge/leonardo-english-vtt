Hello, hello, hello, and welcome

00:00:07.904 --> 00:00:09.854
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.854 --> 00:00:12.474
Minds, by Leonardo English, the show

00:00:12.484 --> 00:00:14.264
where you can listen to fascinating

00:00:14.264 --> 00:00:16.654
stories and learn weird and wonderful

00:00:16.664 --> 00:00:18.654
things about the world at the same

00:00:18.714 --> 00:00:20.494
time as improving your English.

00:00:20.924 --> 00:00:24.204
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going

00:00:24.214 --> 00:00:26.684
to be talking about the minimum wage.

00:00:27.224 --> 00:00:29.634
In many countries around the world, there

00:00:29.634 --> 00:00:32.274
are laws stating the minimum amount of

00:00:32.274 --> 00:00:34.674
money that an employee should earn for

00:00:34.674 --> 00:00:37.454
doing a job, the so-called “minimum wage”.

00:00:37.944 --> 00:00:40.104
To some, this is a worthy

00:00:40.104 --> 00:00:42.634
achievement, a law that protects

00:00:42.634 --> 00:00:45.034
workers from exploitation at the

00:00:45.034 --> 00:00:47.084
hands of greedy corporations.

00:00:47.534 --> 00:00:49.934
To others, it is a red herring,

00:00:50.182 --> 00:00:52.641
a feel-good measure that hurts

00:00:52.771 --> 00:00:54.851
the very people it aims to help.

00:00:55.211 --> 00:00:57.941
So, in this episode, we’ll explore the

00:00:57.951 --> 00:01:00.471
history of the minimum wage, we’ll look

00:01:00.471 --> 00:01:02.961
at some of the arguments for and against,

00:01:03.311 --> 00:01:05.241
we’ll look at some examples of countries

00:01:05.261 --> 00:01:07.117
where it has worked,  others where it

00:01:07.137 --> 00:01:09.267
hasn’t, we’ll talk about the particular

00:01:09.267 --> 00:01:12.397
case of the UK, and we’ll also learn about

00:01:12.397 --> 00:01:15.457
how sometimes not having a minimum wage,

00:01:15.657 --> 00:01:18.517
surprisingly enough, actually results in

00:01:18.537 --> 00:01:21.547
higher wages for the lowest paid workers.

00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:25.173
OK then, let’s get right into it,

00:01:25.393 --> 00:01:27.603
and talk about The Minimum Wage.

00:01:29.173 --> 00:01:31.433
I imagine that many of you can

00:01:31.433 --> 00:01:34.103
remember your first real paycheck.

00:01:35.035 --> 00:01:38.105
In the autumn, after I finished school,

00:01:38.395 --> 00:01:41.255
I worked in a pub in a nearby village,

00:01:41.545 --> 00:01:43.865
pulling pints, serving drinks and

00:01:44.025 --> 00:01:46.365
making small talk with the regulars.

00:01:47.095 --> 00:01:49.715
The shifts were quite long at times.

00:01:50.065 --> 00:01:52.935
12 pm to 12 am was the longest

00:01:52.935 --> 00:01:54.385
one, if I’m not mistaken.

00:01:55.285 --> 00:01:57.135
Afterwards, I would go home on

00:01:57.135 --> 00:02:00.215
my bike, exhausted after 12 hours

00:02:00.215 --> 00:02:02.545
on my feet, serving drinkers who

00:02:02.545 --> 00:02:04.275
would sometimes get increasingly

00:02:04.305 --> 00:02:06.425
troublesome as the night went on.

00:02:07.465 --> 00:02:12.649
For my work, I was paid £4.25 every

00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:15.339
hour - the minimum wage in the UK at

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:17.339
the time, or at least, the minimum

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:20.285
wage for everyone under the age of 22.

00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:23.139
And for reference, this was

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:26.889
in 2005, so it was about €6.

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:30.379
It seemed like a lot to me.

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:32.909
But I was living at home with

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:34.959
my parents, I didn’t pay rent,

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.099
and I didn’t pay for groceries.

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:40.549
It seemed like a lot to a fresh-faced

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:43.129
18-year-old, but clearly, it

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:45.879
wasn’t, at least not in the UK.

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.619
It was the minimum that any

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:50.909
company was legally allowed to

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:53.019
pay an employee; I literally

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:54.909
couldn’t have been paid any less.

00:02:56.325 --> 00:02:58.979
But of course, this idea, that the

00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:01.909
government should step in and set a

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:04.319
legal minimum for how little someone can

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.419
be paid, is a relatively new concept.

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:11.189
For most of history, wages

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:13.539
were determined by the market,

00:03:13.929 --> 00:03:16.329
or more accurately, by power.

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:19.939
Whether you worked in the fields or

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:22.289
later on in a factory, the amount you

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:24.989
were paid was the result of a direct

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:28.099
agreement between you and your employer.

00:03:28.938 --> 00:03:30.341
If you were desperate for work,

00:03:30.761 --> 00:03:32.511
and your employer knew it, they

00:03:32.511 --> 00:03:34.651
could pay you next to nothing.

00:03:35.401 --> 00:03:37.211
And they often did.

00:03:37.851 --> 00:03:40.681
Pick up any Charles Dickens novel and

00:03:40.851 --> 00:03:43.341
you’ll find depictions of evil employers

00:03:43.581 --> 00:03:45.931
squeezing their workers for every last

00:03:45.941 --> 00:03:48.961
penny, paying them the absolute minimum

00:03:48.961 --> 00:03:51.691
possible for them to not die of starvation

00:03:51.971 --> 00:03:53.841
or from freezing to death at home.

00:03:55.208 --> 00:03:57.278
And of course, the UK was not

00:03:57.328 --> 00:03:59.198
alone in this, in its basically

00:03:59.468 --> 00:04:01.308
“zero state intervention” policy

00:04:01.478 --> 00:04:03.428
in terms of the amount an employer

00:04:03.428 --> 00:04:04.958
needed to pay its employees.

00:04:05.508 --> 00:04:07.888
All over the world, workers

00:04:08.228 --> 00:04:11.218
typically had few protections, few

00:04:11.428 --> 00:04:13.478
safeguards ensuring that they were

00:04:13.508 --> 00:04:15.918
paid enough to live a decent life.

00:04:17.258 --> 00:04:20.028
And although it is now popular to talk

00:04:20.038 --> 00:04:22.848
about how we must crush the rich and

00:04:23.028 --> 00:04:25.148
how evil billionaires are exploiting

00:04:25.148 --> 00:04:28.138
the poor, the reality is that living

00:04:28.138 --> 00:04:30.738
standards and disposable income for

00:04:30.748 --> 00:04:33.568
the poorest in society, in practically

00:04:33.638 --> 00:04:35.478
every country in the world, have

00:04:35.478 --> 00:04:37.598
never been higher than they are today.

00:04:38.838 --> 00:04:41.168
This is thanks to economic growth,

00:04:41.748 --> 00:04:44.008
but there is an argument to be

00:04:44.008 --> 00:04:46.868
made that it is also thanks to

00:04:46.868 --> 00:04:49.158
the concept of the minimum wage.

00:04:49.788 --> 00:04:52.278
In other words, the lowest salaries in

00:04:52.278 --> 00:04:55.118
society are higher than ever before,

00:04:55.518 --> 00:04:57.458
thanks to government intervention,

00:04:57.908 --> 00:05:00.838
laws protecting workers from low pay.

00:05:02.218 --> 00:05:04.938
Governments first started to get involved

00:05:05.118 --> 00:05:07.988
at the end of the 19th century, and in

00:05:07.988 --> 00:05:10.988
fact, the first countries to legislate

00:05:11.008 --> 00:05:13.365
minimum wage laws were in a part of

00:05:13.508 --> 00:05:15.718
the world you might not necessarily

00:05:15.718 --> 00:05:19.278
expect: not post-revolutionary France

00:05:19.308 --> 00:05:22.008
or English factory workers weary of

00:05:22.008 --> 00:05:24.568
working 12 hours a day, 7 days a week.

00:05:25.488 --> 00:05:28.238
It was, in fact, on the other side of

00:05:28.258 --> 00:05:31.278
the world, in Australia and New Zealand.

00:05:32.678 --> 00:05:35.168
In both countries, there was growing

00:05:35.168 --> 00:05:38.488
concern that certain workers in certain

00:05:38.528 --> 00:05:41.198
industries, especially women working

00:05:41.208 --> 00:05:43.738
in clothes factories, were being paid

00:05:43.778 --> 00:05:46.108
so little that they couldn’t afford

00:05:46.338 --> 00:05:48.478
even the basic necessities of life.

00:05:49.748 --> 00:05:52.628
A small number of employers held all

00:05:52.628 --> 00:05:55.438
the power, and governments feared that

00:05:55.478 --> 00:05:57.708
unless something changed, there would

00:05:57.718 --> 00:06:00.268
be civil unrest, and they would have

00:06:00.268 --> 00:06:02.458
a French Revolution-type situation

00:06:02.458 --> 00:06:04.838
on their hands, with angry workers

00:06:05.048 --> 00:06:07.128
rising up against their rulers.

00:06:08.615 --> 00:06:10.835
The first laws came into place

00:06:11.005 --> 00:06:14.515
in 1894 in New Zealand, and

00:06:14.605 --> 00:06:16.155
in Australia two years later.

00:06:17.385 --> 00:06:20.125
Initially, they were focused on individual

00:06:20.155 --> 00:06:22.585
industries, but they quickly spread.

00:06:23.975 --> 00:06:27.225
The idea was codified by a 1907

00:06:27.235 --> 00:06:29.746
law called The Harvester Case,

00:06:30.056 --> 00:06:31.826
which stated that there should be a

00:06:31.826 --> 00:06:34.426
'living wage' for, and I’m quoting

00:06:34.426 --> 00:06:37.766
directly, a man, his wife, and three

00:06:37.766 --> 00:06:41.176
children to "live in frugal comfort".

00:06:42.166 --> 00:06:45.206
Frugal, by the way, means careful with

00:06:45.206 --> 00:06:48.706
money, so frugal comfort means living

00:06:48.776 --> 00:06:51.726
comfortably but without any luxuries.

00:06:52.746 --> 00:06:55.406
In other words, every job should

00:06:55.466 --> 00:06:57.666
pay enough to support a decent

00:06:57.706 --> 00:07:00.636
life for a family of five: a man,

00:07:00.906 --> 00:07:02.686
his wife, and three children.

00:07:03.456 --> 00:07:06.126
Now, perhaps you can complain about this

00:07:06.356 --> 00:07:08.756
seeming like an archaic view of the world,

00:07:08.866 --> 00:07:11.496
of a man going out to earn a living while

00:07:11.496 --> 00:07:13.686
his wife and three children stay at home.

00:07:14.236 --> 00:07:16.626
This was more than 100 years ago, so

00:07:16.826 --> 00:07:18.866
clearly, certain things were different.

00:07:19.286 --> 00:07:22.296
But what you might also quite rightly

00:07:22.296 --> 00:07:24.356
point out is that this “living

00:07:24.356 --> 00:07:27.056
wage” must surely have been more

00:07:27.066 --> 00:07:29.576
generous than a modern “living wage”,

00:07:29.856 --> 00:07:32.226
given that it aims to support one

00:07:32.296 --> 00:07:34.956
non-working parent and three children.

00:07:36.296 --> 00:07:39.216
In 21st-century Britain, at least, you

00:07:39.216 --> 00:07:40.956
would certainly struggle to support

00:07:40.956 --> 00:07:43.526
a family of five on the minimum wage.

00:07:44.496 --> 00:07:47.486
But back to the start of the 20th century.

00:07:48.376 --> 00:07:50.826
Understandably, the introduction of

00:07:50.826 --> 00:07:53.166
the minimum wage proved popular with

00:07:53.166 --> 00:07:56.250
workers, and the idea quickly spread.

00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:00.550
In 1909, the United Kingdom passed

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:02.510
something called the Trade Boards

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:05.400
Act, which established wage boards

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:08.060
to set minimum wages in industries

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:09.440
that were considered especially

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:12.460
exploitative, things like garment work,

00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:14.970
where mainly women and children were

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:17.820
exploited, forced to work long hours in

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:20.610
terrible conditions for very low pay.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:24.020
In the United States, a national

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:25.940
minimum wage came a little

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:28.330
later, but not without a fight.

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:32.480
It was introduced in 1938, during the

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:34.730
Great Depression, as part of President

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:37.100
Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal.

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:41.750
At the time, it was set at $0.25 an hour,

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:46.360
around $5.70 in inflation-adjusted terms.

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:49.730
Even though the idea had spread

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:51.740
through much of Europe, it was

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:54.070
still a radical idea in America.

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:56.800
It was the biggest economy in the

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.400
world, the roaring heart of capitalism,

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:02.330
and the idea that the government

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:05.340
should intervene and say “this is

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:06.980
the minimum a company can pay its

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:10.120
employees”, well, that was controversial.

00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:13.130
It would cost jobs, employers cried,

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:15.020
it would result in people being paid

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:17.340
less because companies would sack them.

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:20.000
Companies would go out of business if

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.580
they had to pay these higher wages.

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:25.150
To this, President Franklin D. Roosevelt

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:28.400
had a plain answer: tough luck.

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:32.330
Or, as he put it, “ it seems to me to

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:34.940
be equally plain that no business, which

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:37.610
depends for existence on paying less

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:40.250
than living wages to its workers, has

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:42.410
any right to continue in this country."

00:09:43.068 --> 00:09:45.288
In other words, if you can’t pay

00:09:45.318 --> 00:09:47.738
a fair wage to your employees,

00:09:47.928 --> 00:09:50.098
you deserve to go out of business.

00:09:50.918 --> 00:09:53.528
Now, the minimum wage in the US today

00:09:53.778 --> 00:09:56.258
has not moved on much; the federal

00:09:56.408 --> 00:09:58.948
minimum wage is dismally low, at

00:09:58.948 --> 00:10:02.978
$7.25 an hour, but various states have

00:10:03.008 --> 00:10:04.978
different laws about what companies

00:10:04.998 --> 00:10:07.078
are required to pay their employees.

00:10:07.798 --> 00:10:10.738
Almost 100 years later, in the spiritual

00:10:10.748 --> 00:10:13.628
home of free-market capitalism, the

00:10:13.628 --> 00:10:16.538
debate about the minimum wage rages on.

00:10:17.008 --> 00:10:19.498
As it does, in fact, in every country

00:10:19.708 --> 00:10:21.748
that has legislated on the minimum

00:10:21.748 --> 00:10:23.918
wage, or where there are talks

00:10:23.918 --> 00:10:26.008
about changing or increasing it.

00:10:26.938 --> 00:10:29.358
Its supporters argue that it needs

00:10:29.358 --> 00:10:32.248
to be protected at all costs, created

00:10:32.588 --> 00:10:34.598
if it doesn’t exist already, or

00:10:34.858 --> 00:10:37.498
increased if it is considered too low.

00:10:38.378 --> 00:10:41.197
Without a fair minimum wage, the most

00:10:41.237 --> 00:10:44.167
vulnerable in society risk being even

00:10:44.167 --> 00:10:46.917
more exploited by powerful corporations.

00:10:47.437 --> 00:10:50.367
People would be at the mercy of employers

00:10:50.367 --> 00:10:52.117
who could pay as little as they liked,

00:10:52.331 --> 00:10:55.043
especially in industries where workers

00:10:55.053 --> 00:10:56.753
have very little bargaining power.

00:10:57.533 --> 00:10:59.483
A minimum wage ensures that

00:10:59.483 --> 00:11:01.113
there is at least a basic level

00:11:01.113 --> 00:11:03.843
of fairness, that no one working

00:11:03.843 --> 00:11:05.803
full-time should live in poverty.

00:11:07.203 --> 00:11:09.593
On the other hand, critics argue that

00:11:09.603 --> 00:11:13.053
setting a minimum wage could actually harm

00:11:13.233 --> 00:11:15.563
the very people it is designed to help.

00:11:16.303 --> 00:11:18.293
If you set the minimum wage too

00:11:18.293 --> 00:11:21.273
high, they argue, employers might

00:11:21.303 --> 00:11:23.693
respond by hiring fewer people,

00:11:23.933 --> 00:11:26.163
cutting hours, replacing workers with

00:11:26.163 --> 00:11:29.003
machines, or, of course, with AI.

00:11:30.423 --> 00:11:32.893
They say that it can lead to higher

00:11:32.943 --> 00:11:35.313
unemployment, especially among young

00:11:35.313 --> 00:11:37.273
people, those with lower levels

00:11:37.273 --> 00:11:39.763
of education, or those entering

00:11:39.763 --> 00:11:41.713
the job market for the first time.

00:11:42.691 --> 00:11:45.136
In other words, some people might

00:11:45.136 --> 00:11:47.206
be better off, those who keep their

00:11:47.206 --> 00:11:50.096
jobs and their same hours, but others

00:11:50.136 --> 00:11:52.436
will lose their jobs completely and

00:11:52.616 --> 00:11:55.136
be in a much worse economic position.

00:11:56.556 --> 00:11:59.126
And the arguments for and against the

00:11:59.126 --> 00:12:01.926
minimum wage go beyond ideas about

00:12:01.926 --> 00:12:04.086
how much money a worker will be paid.

00:12:05.136 --> 00:12:07.086
On the “pro minimum wage” side,

00:12:07.406 --> 00:12:09.866
supporters argue that it can also

00:12:09.876 --> 00:12:11.746
boost morale and productivity.

00:12:12.506 --> 00:12:14.196
When workers feel they are being

00:12:14.216 --> 00:12:16.806
treated fairly and paid a decent wage,

00:12:17.166 --> 00:12:19.266
they are more likely to take pride in

00:12:19.266 --> 00:12:21.326
their work, stay with their employer

00:12:21.356 --> 00:12:23.926
for longer, and to contribute more.

00:12:24.906 --> 00:12:27.336
This is good for them, good for their

00:12:27.356 --> 00:12:29.816
mental health, and it’s also good

00:12:29.866 --> 00:12:32.296
for the business, because it reduces

00:12:32.326 --> 00:12:34.866
turnover and increases productivity.

00:12:35.716 --> 00:12:37.856
Another argument in favour of

00:12:37.856 --> 00:12:39.846
the minimum wage is that it

00:12:39.916 --> 00:12:41.676
increases consumer spending.

00:12:42.536 --> 00:12:45.326
If low-wage workers have more money

00:12:45.336 --> 00:12:47.426
in their pockets, they are likely to

00:12:47.436 --> 00:12:49.996
spend it in their local communities,

00:12:50.276 --> 00:12:52.006
which helps stimulate the economy.

00:12:52.896 --> 00:12:55.006
The wealthier an individual is, the

00:12:55.006 --> 00:12:57.046
higher proportion of their income they

00:12:57.046 --> 00:13:01.056
save, so if a company pays low earners

00:13:01.136 --> 00:13:04.047
more, they will typically spend a greater

00:13:04.047 --> 00:13:06.507
percentage of what they make than what

00:13:06.517 --> 00:13:08.437
the wealthy company owners would spend.

00:13:09.247 --> 00:13:11.487
So, it’s a good thing for local

00:13:11.957 --> 00:13:14.167
and general economic growth.

00:13:15.239 --> 00:13:17.875
But there are also more arguments

00:13:17.875 --> 00:13:19.955
on the “anti-minimum wage” side.

00:13:20.775 --> 00:13:23.375
Firstly, the concern that it puts

00:13:23.385 --> 00:13:25.135
pressure on small businesses.

00:13:26.035 --> 00:13:29.115
A large multinational company might be

00:13:29.115 --> 00:13:31.935
able to absorb the higher wage costs,

00:13:32.255 --> 00:13:35.305
but for a small shop or restaurant

00:13:35.443 --> 00:13:37.393
operating on wafer-thin profit

00:13:37.393 --> 00:13:39.553
margins, it could mean the difference

00:13:39.733 --> 00:13:42.243
between staying open or shutting down.

00:13:43.563 --> 00:13:46.273
Some economists argue that a blanket

00:13:46.273 --> 00:13:50.023
minimum wage is a blunt tool, like trying

00:13:50.023 --> 00:13:52.803
to tend to a flowerbed with a lawnmower

00:13:53.153 --> 00:13:54.953
instead of precise little scissors.

00:13:55.853 --> 00:13:58.293
A blanket minimum wage treats every

00:13:58.293 --> 00:14:01.203
region and every industry the same,

00:14:01.643 --> 00:14:03.023
even though the cost of living

00:14:03.233 --> 00:14:05.703
and average wages vary hugely.

00:14:07.125 --> 00:14:09.995
In the UK, for example, the entire

00:14:10.065 --> 00:14:11.815
country is treated in the same

00:14:11.815 --> 00:14:14.495
way, it is a national minimum wage.

00:14:14.905 --> 00:14:17.105
As of April this year, it’s

00:14:17.195 --> 00:14:20.025
£12.21 an hour whether you live in

00:14:20.025 --> 00:14:22.515
central London or a remote village

00:14:22.585 --> 00:14:23.865
in the north of the country.

00:14:24.755 --> 00:14:26.715
And to state the obvious, like

00:14:26.715 --> 00:14:28.545
in almost every country, the

00:14:28.575 --> 00:14:30.765
cost of living varies a lot.

00:14:31.265 --> 00:14:34.315
What you can buy with £12.21 in

00:14:34.325 --> 00:14:36.825
London is very different from what

00:14:36.835 --> 00:14:40.315
you can buy with £12.21 in rural

00:14:40.315 --> 00:14:42.955
Wales or even a lower-cost-of-living

00:14:42.955 --> 00:14:45.855
city like Belfast or Newcastle.

00:14:46.565 --> 00:14:48.945
Yet the pay for a minimum

00:14:48.945 --> 00:14:50.725
wage worker is the same.

00:14:52.085 --> 00:14:55.015
This isn’t fair for workers, the argument

00:14:55.015 --> 00:14:57.385
goes, someone in London needs to be

00:14:57.385 --> 00:15:00.135
paid more, and someone in Newcastle

00:15:00.335 --> 00:15:02.355
doesn’t need to be paid as much.

00:15:03.235 --> 00:15:05.645
It also isn’t fair for businesses.

00:15:06.295 --> 00:15:08.525
A wage that is perfectly reasonable

00:15:08.755 --> 00:15:10.995
in high-cost central London might

00:15:10.995 --> 00:15:13.285
be completely unaffordable for a

00:15:13.285 --> 00:15:15.535
small business in a rural town.

00:15:16.795 --> 00:15:19.175
Now, I should add that some countries

00:15:19.425 --> 00:15:21.515
do legislate on the minimum wage

00:15:21.703 --> 00:15:23.825
at a more regional level, which

00:15:24.115 --> 00:15:26.315
evens out some of these disparities.

00:15:26.901 --> 00:15:29.779
In China, for example, the minimum wage

00:15:29.789 --> 00:15:33.459
in Beijing is almost 70% higher than it

00:15:33.469 --> 00:15:36.349
is in rural western China, which helps

00:15:36.389 --> 00:15:38.509
account for the different cost of living.

00:15:39.917 --> 00:15:41.807
There is also the argument that

00:15:41.807 --> 00:15:44.587
the minimum wage, if set too low,

00:15:45.037 --> 00:15:48.537
legitimises and encourages low pay.

00:15:49.479 --> 00:15:52.817
In the UK, many minimum wage workers

00:15:53.037 --> 00:15:55.137
are still forced to turn to the

00:15:55.137 --> 00:15:57.417
state for financial assistance.

00:15:57.857 --> 00:16:00.617
But because their employers have met

00:16:00.647 --> 00:16:03.107
their legal obligations, they can

00:16:03.117 --> 00:16:04.837
wash their hands of the situation,

00:16:05.147 --> 00:16:06.847
saying “we’re paying what we need

00:16:06.847 --> 00:16:09.207
to do”, rather than paying a fair

00:16:09.437 --> 00:16:11.627
and honest wage to their workers.

00:16:12.777 --> 00:16:14.887
And finally, there is also the

00:16:14.887 --> 00:16:17.297
argument that it does not necessarily

00:16:17.327 --> 00:16:19.997
target those who need help the most.

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:23.450
In some cases, the person earning

00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:26.100
a minimum wage might be a student

00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:29.030
living at home, like I was, or a

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:31.500
second earner in a well-off household.

00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:34.550
In other words, not everyone

00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:36.690
earning the minimum wage is living

00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:39.244
in poverty, and not everyone in

00:16:39.244 --> 00:16:41.880
poverty is earning the minimum wage.

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:45.060
So, what would happen if

00:16:45.090 --> 00:16:46.870
there were no minimum wage?

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:50.715
In theory, to the critics of the minimum

00:16:50.715 --> 00:16:53.590
wage at least, businesses and employees

00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:56.250
would be free to set their own wages.

00:16:56.730 --> 00:16:58.580
People in high-cost-of-living

00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:00.550
areas would be paid more, and

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:02.330
people in lower-cost-of-living

00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:03.970
areas would be paid less.

00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:07.500
And this is not just theory.

00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:10.140
There are actually plenty of examples of

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:13.330
countries without minimum wage laws, some

00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:16.420
where employees are paid much more than

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:18.850
in countries which have minimum wages.

00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:23.130
Sweden, for example, has no minimum

00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:25.510
wage laws, yet it has one of the

00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:27.870
highest median wages in Europe.

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:31.510
In fact, most Scandinavian countries,

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:33.670
which tend to be at the top of

00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:35.950
every table with average wages

00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:37.730
and living standards, they don’t

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:40.060
have national minimum wage laws.

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:43.640
Now, this isn’t due to the great

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:45.990
benevolence and kindness of

00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:48.421
Scandinavian employers, but rather

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:51.420
that most jobs are covered by trade

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:54.260
union agreements, so the union will

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:57.000
negotiate wages on behalf of employees.

00:17:58.130 --> 00:18:00.300
These employees are highly protected

00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:02.220
in terms of what a company can pay

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:04.520
them, the protection just comes

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:06.810
from the trade union, not the state.

00:18:07.783 --> 00:18:10.283
The logic behind this is that wages

00:18:10.523 --> 00:18:12.513
are better determined by those who

00:18:12.583 --> 00:18:14.803
understand the specific needs of an

00:18:14.813 --> 00:18:18.113
industry, rather than by politicians, and,

00:18:18.493 --> 00:18:21.063
given the relatively high wages of the

00:18:21.063 --> 00:18:23.623
lowest-paid workers in Scandinavia, it’s

00:18:23.623 --> 00:18:26.163
hard to deny that it works pretty well.

00:18:27.089 --> 00:18:28.849
Now, the last thing I want to talk

00:18:28.859 --> 00:18:31.169
about today is the situation in the

00:18:31.179 --> 00:18:33.959
UK, because something interesting has

00:18:33.959 --> 00:18:36.117
been happening with the minimum wage.

00:18:37.247 --> 00:18:38.837
Ever since the national minimum

00:18:38.837 --> 00:18:41.277
wage was introduced by Tony Blair

00:18:41.439 --> 00:18:44.989
in 1999, it has continued to rise.

00:18:45.709 --> 00:18:49.319
It started at £3.60 an hour, and

00:18:49.469 --> 00:18:51.919
in April this year it was increased

00:18:52.129 --> 00:18:56.449
from £11.44 to £12.21 an hour.

00:18:58.019 --> 00:19:00.299
Compounded, this is an average

00:19:00.299 --> 00:19:03.689
growth of almost 5% a year, which is

00:19:03.689 --> 00:19:06.099
significantly higher than the growth

00:19:06.219 --> 00:19:08.689
in non-minimum wage jobs, which

00:19:08.689 --> 00:19:11.749
increased at a rate of 2.8% a year.

00:19:12.659 --> 00:19:16.019
So the minimum wage increased almost

00:19:16.069 --> 00:19:18.889
twice as much as the average salary,

00:19:19.309 --> 00:19:21.679
which has led to this slightly unusual

00:19:21.679 --> 00:19:23.989
situation in which the difference

00:19:24.199 --> 00:19:27.099
between minimum wage jobs and more

00:19:27.109 --> 00:19:30.239
skilled jobs has been massively reduced.

00:19:31.379 --> 00:19:34.159
For example, the salary for a

00:19:34.169 --> 00:19:36.659
graduate nuclear engineer in

00:19:36.659 --> 00:19:40.779
the UK starts at around £22,000

00:19:40.779 --> 00:19:44.119
year, which is around €25,000.

00:19:45.069 --> 00:19:48.039
The minimum wage of £12.21 an hour,

00:19:48.419 --> 00:19:51.159
for someone working full-time, would

00:19:51.159 --> 00:19:56.329
result in a salary of £23,873 a year,

00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:59.929
more than a graduate nuclear engineer.

00:20:00.649 --> 00:20:03.269
Now, clearly, the nuclear engineer most

00:20:03.289 --> 00:20:05.469
likely has better career prospects;

00:20:05.539 --> 00:20:08.399
they can get promoted, paid more, and

00:20:08.399 --> 00:20:10.289
perhaps the work is more fulfilling

00:20:10.569 --> 00:20:12.399
than in many minimum-wage jobs.

00:20:13.099 --> 00:20:15.239
Perhaps you might even argue that this

00:20:15.239 --> 00:20:17.610
is the way it should be, that someone

00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:20.150
doing public service cleaning the streets

00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:22.370
in the rain should be paid just as

00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:25.080
much, more, even, than someone sitting

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:27.340
behind a desk and answering emails.

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:31.190
But there have been plenty of stories in

00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:33.860
the British press over the past few years

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:36.270
of young people complaining about this

00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:39.220
situation, asking themselves why they

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:42.410
should slave away at university for 3 or

00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:45.050
4 years, getting into tens of thousands

00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:47.557
of pounds of debt only to get a job

00:20:47.807 --> 00:20:50.037
where they are paid the same as someone

00:20:50.037 --> 00:20:53.137
working in an unskilled, minimum wage job.

00:20:53.827 --> 00:20:56.347
“What’s the point of studying and working

00:20:56.347 --> 00:20:58.637
hard,” they ask, “if it isn’t going to

00:20:58.637 --> 00:21:01.267
result in any better financial situation?”

00:21:02.497 --> 00:21:04.847
To wrap things up, the minimum

00:21:04.847 --> 00:21:06.877
wage is one of those fascinating

00:21:06.877 --> 00:21:09.327
topics that divides people on both

00:21:09.337 --> 00:21:11.377
sides of the political spectrum.

00:21:12.417 --> 00:21:14.987
On the right, there are those who oppose

00:21:14.987 --> 00:21:17.557
it because they see it as excessive

00:21:17.557 --> 00:21:18.987
government intervention in the free

00:21:18.987 --> 00:21:21.747
market, something that distorts natural

00:21:21.747 --> 00:21:25.007
supply and demand and risks killing jobs.

00:21:25.407 --> 00:21:27.467
But there are also those on the right

00:21:27.547 --> 00:21:29.807
who support it as a way of reducing

00:21:29.807 --> 00:21:31.167
the need for government welfare,

00:21:31.597 --> 00:21:33.347
arguing that if people are paid

00:21:33.347 --> 00:21:35.907
more, they rely less on the state.

00:21:36.907 --> 00:21:39.077
On the left, there are those who support

00:21:39.087 --> 00:21:41.137
it because it protects vulnerable

00:21:41.137 --> 00:21:44.537
workers, reduces inequality, and ensures

00:21:44.567 --> 00:21:46.997
a basic level of dignity in work.

00:21:47.627 --> 00:21:49.407
But they have colleagues on the left

00:21:49.627 --> 00:21:51.837
who criticise it as a distraction,

00:21:52.287 --> 00:21:54.697
arguing that it doesn't go far enough,

00:21:55.057 --> 00:21:56.857
and that we should be talking instead

00:21:56.867 --> 00:21:59.787
about living wages, stronger unions,

00:21:59.962 --> 00:22:02.045
or even universal basic income.

00:22:03.445 --> 00:22:05.605
Indeed, when I was researching this

00:22:05.605 --> 00:22:08.275
episode and I wanted to double-check

00:22:08.285 --> 00:22:10.515
the date that Tony Blair’s government

00:22:10.655 --> 00:22:12.635
implemented the minimum wage, I

00:22:12.695 --> 00:22:15.455
googled “Tony Blair minimum wage”.

00:22:16.285 --> 00:22:18.555
The first two results I got were

00:22:18.565 --> 00:22:21.175
both from left-leaning publications:

00:22:21.606 --> 00:22:23.533
Jacobin and The Guardian.

00:22:24.563 --> 00:22:28.113
The first result read “Britain’s Minimum

00:22:28.113 --> 00:22:31.203
Wage Law Has Been an Abject Failure”.

00:22:32.313 --> 00:22:34.813
And the second read, “Minimum

00:22:34.813 --> 00:22:37.093
wage is UK’s ‘most successful

00:22:37.123 --> 00:22:39.113
economic policy in a generation’”.

00:22:40.533 --> 00:22:43.023
It just goes to show that when it comes

00:22:43.023 --> 00:22:45.423
to the minimum wage, two people who

00:22:45.423 --> 00:22:47.843
might otherwise agree on most things can

00:22:47.843 --> 00:22:50.863
look at exactly the same policy and come

00:22:50.863 --> 00:22:53.353
to drastically different conclusions.

00:22:54.963 --> 00:22:57.243
OK then, that is it for today's

00:22:57.243 --> 00:22:59.303
episode on the minimum wage.

00:22:59.546 --> 00:23:00.826
I hope it's been an interesting one

00:23:01.116 --> 00:23:02.786
and that you've learnt something new.

00:23:03.376 --> 00:23:05.076
As always, I would love to know

00:23:05.076 --> 00:23:06.346
what you thought of this episode.

00:23:06.766 --> 00:23:08.806
Is there a minimum wage in your country?

00:23:09.166 --> 00:23:10.806
How has it changed over time,

00:23:11.116 --> 00:23:13.016
and what do you think about its

00:23:13.016 --> 00:23:15.336
advantages and disadvantages?

00:23:15.764 --> 00:23:17.574
