Hello, hello, hello, and welcome

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:09.990
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.810
Minds, by Leonardo English, the show

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.610
where you can listen to fascinating

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.120
stories and learn weird and wonderful

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.180
things about the world at the same

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.060
time as improving your English.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.119
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.740
to be talking about the Darién Scheme.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.720
It is a fascinating period of history,

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.599
a supposedly genius idea to transform

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.590
global trade and generate vast wealth and

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.669
riches for Scotland, all by colonising

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.970
a tiny part of Central America.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.110
As you might be able to imagine, it

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.920
didn’t quite go to plan, and ended

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.350
in the creation of modern Britain.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.130
So, let’s not waste a minute

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.266
and get right into it.

00:00:58.029 --> 00:01:01.300
The Pan-American highway is, by some

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.080
standards, the longest road in the world.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.470
Starting at Prudhoe Bay, in Alaska,

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.250
you can drive all the way down through

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.239
Canada, the United States, Mexico,

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.969
Central America, and continue down

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:18.740
through Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Chile,

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.130
and end up in Argentina, right at the

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.729
very southern tip of South America.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.669
The total length is around 30,000

00:01:28.669 --> 00:01:31.440
kilometres, and it’s probably more

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.929
accurate to call it a large collection

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.240
of roads rather than a single road,

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.720
as there are multiple ways you can go.

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.630
And another important clarification

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.670
is that you can’t actually go all

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.749
the way from the top to the bottom.

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:51.370
There is a break, an area where the road

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.289
comes to a halt, in modern-day Panama.

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.710
This is the Darién Gap, the

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.390
dense and inhospitable rainforest

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.679
area in southeastern Panama

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:04.650
and northwestern Colombia.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.820
To this day, there are no functional

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:12.420
roads, and anyone wishing to cross it

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.809
must make the treacherous journey on foot.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.230
But just over 300 years ago, an

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.420
enterprising Scottish man called William

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.690
Paterson had a plan for this area, a

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.760
plan that he thought would make him,

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.310
and his country, spectacularly wealthy.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.360
He had spent some time in the

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.090
Caribbean and had got an idea.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.820
Ships transporting goods between Asia and

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:47.349
Europe needed to sail all the way around

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:50.100
Cape Horn, at the bottom of South America.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.660
Paterson had a plan to fix this.

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.209
Instead of going all the way around, a

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.000
ship could sail to modern-day Panama,

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:03.209
unload its cargo, and this would

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:06.235
be transported by land for the 50

00:03:06.283 --> 00:03:08.320
kilometres or so to the other side,

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.970
where it would be loaded onto another

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.030
ship and continue its onward journey.

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:18.390
It was a clever idea, on paper, at least.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.179
Why spend months battling storms and

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.019
freezing temperatures around the southern

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.430
tip of the continent when you could simply

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.739
carry goods across a narrow strip of land?

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.230
Now, you might be thinking, “Uhm,

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.119
surely a better idea would have

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.870
been to dig a canal?”, and of

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.940
course, this is the solution that

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.179
exists today: the Panama Canal.

00:03:42.208 --> 00:03:44.454
Quick side note: we also have an

00:03:44.454 --> 00:03:46.804
episode on the Panama Canal, in case you

00:03:46.804 --> 00:03:48.154
haven’t listened to that one already.

00:03:48.394 --> 00:03:50.904
It’s episode number 411.

00:03:51.554 --> 00:03:54.744
But let’s go back to the late 17th

00:03:54.774 --> 00:03:57.244
century, and this enterprising

00:03:57.254 --> 00:03:58.804
young Scottish merchant.

00:03:59.694 --> 00:04:02.334
Paterson’s plan was a land route.

00:04:03.234 --> 00:04:07.214
Back in the 1690s, pre the Industrial

00:04:07.214 --> 00:04:09.794
Revolution, the idea of a canal

00:04:10.124 --> 00:04:12.234
would have been unthinkable.

00:04:12.844 --> 00:04:14.764
There was dense jungle and

00:04:14.774 --> 00:04:17.144
mountainous ground; engineering

00:04:17.324 --> 00:04:19.984
a 50 km canal through all that

00:04:20.034 --> 00:04:21.984
would have been utterly impossible.

00:04:22.454 --> 00:04:24.974
The technology simply didn’t exist.

00:04:25.984 --> 00:04:28.934
Paterson was working within the realms

00:04:29.044 --> 00:04:31.174
of what he thought was possible.

00:04:31.584 --> 00:04:34.504
Goods would be hauled overland using

00:04:34.564 --> 00:04:38.214
pack animals, human labour, and possibly

00:04:38.224 --> 00:04:41.254
some sort of rudimentary road or track.

00:04:41.864 --> 00:04:44.674
It would be a kind of relay system for

00:04:44.704 --> 00:04:47.974
global trade, with New Caledonia, the

00:04:47.974 --> 00:04:50.144
name he gave to this planned Scottish

00:04:50.174 --> 00:04:53.264
colony, acting as the vital middleman.

00:04:54.474 --> 00:04:56.894
What’s more, with its strategic

00:04:56.904 --> 00:04:58.944
location in the West Indies, it

00:04:58.944 --> 00:05:01.474
could become a booming trading port.

00:05:02.564 --> 00:05:05.474
And if it worked, Scotland

00:05:05.754 --> 00:05:07.324
wouldn’t just become rich.

00:05:07.584 --> 00:05:10.134
It would become powerful, independent,

00:05:10.524 --> 00:05:13.214
and a major player in global trade.

00:05:14.114 --> 00:05:15.124
That was the dream.

00:05:15.644 --> 00:05:17.624
The reality, as we’ll discover,

00:05:17.944 --> 00:05:19.524
was something very different.

00:05:20.104 --> 00:05:22.824
Now, before we get into what actually

00:05:22.834 --> 00:05:26.054
happened and why, it’s worth pausing

00:05:26.054 --> 00:05:28.384
for a moment to reflect on what was

00:05:28.384 --> 00:05:30.514
going on in Scotland and in Great

00:05:30.534 --> 00:05:33.634
Britain at this time, and how all this

00:05:33.634 --> 00:05:36.044
might have helped Paterson convince

00:05:36.044 --> 00:05:38.224
his countrymen to take a punt on

00:05:38.224 --> 00:05:40.434
this scheme halfway across the world.

00:05:41.924 --> 00:05:45.024
In the late 17th century, to put

00:05:45.024 --> 00:05:47.564
it plainly, things were not going

00:05:47.564 --> 00:05:49.434
particularly well in Scotland.

00:05:50.534 --> 00:05:52.704
At this point in history, Scotland

00:05:52.894 --> 00:05:55.364
was still an independent kingdom.

00:05:55.894 --> 00:05:58.474
But, it shared a monarch with England,

00:05:58.754 --> 00:06:02.254
following the Union of the Crowns in 1603.

00:06:03.174 --> 00:06:06.214
There was a curious situation in which

00:06:06.284 --> 00:06:08.994
both countries were ruled by the same

00:06:08.994 --> 00:06:11.904
king, William III, at that point in time.

00:06:12.604 --> 00:06:15.194
But the two countries remained

00:06:15.294 --> 00:06:18.444
politically and economically distinct.

00:06:19.574 --> 00:06:22.554
Scotland had its own parliament, its own

00:06:22.564 --> 00:06:25.104
legal system, and its foreign policy.

00:06:26.164 --> 00:06:29.374
Crucially, it was not part of England’s

00:06:29.374 --> 00:06:32.214
growing empire and was excluded from

00:06:32.254 --> 00:06:34.404
trading in English colonies, in order

00:06:34.404 --> 00:06:36.994
to protect the monopoly and increasing

00:06:37.024 --> 00:06:39.424
profits of the East India Company.

00:06:40.444 --> 00:06:43.474
So, while technically sovereign,

00:06:43.944 --> 00:06:46.654
Scotland found itself in a kind of

00:06:46.894 --> 00:06:50.294
geopolitical limbo: not fully in

00:06:50.294 --> 00:06:52.494
control of its own economic future,

00:06:53.004 --> 00:06:56.254
but also locked out of the prosperity

00:06:56.264 --> 00:06:58.524
enjoyed by other imperial powers.

00:06:59.554 --> 00:07:03.054
What’s more, in the 1690s, the country

00:07:03.054 --> 00:07:05.974
was reeling from a period of extreme

00:07:05.984 --> 00:07:09.074
hardship known as the Seven Ill Years.

00:07:09.944 --> 00:07:12.464
Crop failures had led to widespread

00:07:12.464 --> 00:07:15.264
famine, and tens of thousands of

00:07:15.264 --> 00:07:18.414
people died from starvation or disease.

00:07:19.544 --> 00:07:22.064
Between direct deaths from disease,

00:07:22.414 --> 00:07:24.124
indirect deaths from starvation

00:07:24.464 --> 00:07:26.864
and people who fled abroad, it’s

00:07:26.894 --> 00:07:30.854
estimated that Scotland lost 20% of

00:07:30.854 --> 00:07:33.894
its population in the 1690s alone.

00:07:35.124 --> 00:07:36.744
And there wasn’t much it

00:07:36.744 --> 00:07:38.434
could do to change its fate.

00:07:38.944 --> 00:07:41.284
Trade was dominated by its larger

00:07:41.284 --> 00:07:43.684
neighbour, England, which tightly

00:07:43.684 --> 00:07:46.044
controlled access to colonial markets.

00:07:46.644 --> 00:07:48.554
Scotland had no empire of its own,

00:07:48.774 --> 00:07:51.154
no access to the riches flowing in

00:07:51.154 --> 00:07:53.614
from the Americas, Africa, or Asia.

00:07:54.844 --> 00:07:57.834
And elsewhere in Europe, other colonial

00:07:57.834 --> 00:08:00.264
powers were expanding aggressively.

00:08:00.884 --> 00:08:03.114
The Spanish had long dominated

00:08:03.124 --> 00:08:04.394
Central and South America.

00:08:04.774 --> 00:08:06.814
The Dutch controlled major trading

00:08:06.814 --> 00:08:08.864
ports in Asia and the Caribbean.

00:08:09.164 --> 00:08:10.634
The French were pushing

00:08:10.634 --> 00:08:11.544
into North America.

00:08:11.994 --> 00:08:15.014
And England was consolidating its own

00:08:15.044 --> 00:08:17.084
colonial interests around the globe.

00:08:18.374 --> 00:08:20.954
These countries all had state-backed

00:08:20.954 --> 00:08:23.504
companies, like the Dutch East India

00:08:23.574 --> 00:08:26.114
Company, the English East India Company,

00:08:26.444 --> 00:08:28.994
as well as massive naval infrastructure

00:08:29.254 --> 00:08:31.244
to support their imperial ambitions.

00:08:31.924 --> 00:08:34.204
The Scots had none of this.

00:08:35.334 --> 00:08:37.594
The sense of frustration was deep.

00:08:38.184 --> 00:08:41.374
The country was politically free, but

00:08:41.444 --> 00:08:43.624
economically at the mercy of others.

00:08:44.624 --> 00:08:47.574
For many Scots, the idea of creating

00:08:47.574 --> 00:08:50.384
their own trade route, their own lucrative

00:08:50.434 --> 00:08:53.734
colonial outpost, was not just attractive

00:08:54.104 --> 00:08:56.344
— it felt like a matter of survival.

00:08:57.774 --> 00:09:00.164
William Paterson believed he

00:09:00.164 --> 00:09:02.204
had the answer: the creation

00:09:02.454 --> 00:09:04.844
of this land route over Darién.

00:09:06.174 --> 00:09:09.244
Now, importantly, most historians

00:09:09.494 --> 00:09:11.394
believe that he had never actually

00:09:11.444 --> 00:09:14.254
been to Darién, but had heard about

00:09:14.284 --> 00:09:16.944
it from a Welsh doctor and explorer.

00:09:17.904 --> 00:09:21.264
This doctor, a man called Lionel Wafer,

00:09:21.744 --> 00:09:24.374
had told Paterson about the lush forests

00:09:24.514 --> 00:09:27.784
and supposedly idyllic climate, and

00:09:27.964 --> 00:09:30.274
had also mentioned that the indigenous

00:09:30.294 --> 00:09:32.964
people there had been kind and welcoming.

00:09:34.304 --> 00:09:37.614
And, well, Paterson had decided

00:09:37.764 --> 00:09:39.614
that this was the place.

00:09:40.744 --> 00:09:42.714
In fact, he had been talking about

00:09:42.714 --> 00:09:45.514
this for a long time, since the

00:09:45.524 --> 00:09:49.434
mid-1680s, but few had listened to him.

00:09:50.314 --> 00:09:54.394
However, by the late 1690s, people

00:09:54.414 --> 00:09:56.564
started to take him more seriously.

00:09:57.524 --> 00:10:00.724
Firstly, he was older and better

00:10:00.724 --> 00:10:03.114
connected, and had played a key

00:10:03.114 --> 00:10:05.144
role in the founding of the Bank of

00:10:05.144 --> 00:10:08.204
England, so he commanded more respect.

00:10:09.214 --> 00:10:11.164
And secondly, the mood

00:10:11.174 --> 00:10:13.164
in Scotland had changed.

00:10:13.664 --> 00:10:16.654
Years of famine, economic stagnation,

00:10:17.004 --> 00:10:19.374
and exclusion from lucrative

00:10:19.394 --> 00:10:21.644
colonial trade had created a

00:10:21.674 --> 00:10:24.314
desperate hunger for a bold solution.

00:10:25.444 --> 00:10:27.304
Paterson's plan, which had

00:10:27.314 --> 00:10:29.394
once been dismissed as fantasy,

00:10:29.874 --> 00:10:32.054
now seemed like a lifeline.

00:10:33.234 --> 00:10:35.954
He proposed the creation of a new

00:10:36.044 --> 00:10:38.494
trading company, The Company of Scotland

00:10:38.754 --> 00:10:40.944
Trading to Africa and the Indies.

00:10:41.674 --> 00:10:44.054
Of course, this company needed

00:10:44.064 --> 00:10:47.354
financial backing, but this proved to

00:10:47.354 --> 00:10:49.754
be easier than might have been expected.

00:10:50.864 --> 00:10:53.664
In an extraordinary show of national

00:10:53.664 --> 00:10:58.144
enthusiasm, roughly one-fifth of all

00:10:58.174 --> 00:10:59.969
the money circulating in Scotland at

00:11:00.004 --> 00:11:02.774
the time was invested in the company.

00:11:03.674 --> 00:11:06.334
From the wealthiest aristocrats to

00:11:06.354 --> 00:11:09.434
modest tradesmen, thousands of Scots

00:11:09.664 --> 00:11:12.544
bought shares, hoping to strike it rich.

00:11:13.594 --> 00:11:16.664
But this wasn’t just an economic

00:11:16.664 --> 00:11:19.084
project or financial speculation;

00:11:19.554 --> 00:11:21.784
it became a national cause, a

00:11:21.784 --> 00:11:24.674
symbol of pride and possibility.

00:11:25.824 --> 00:11:28.894
Scotland, it seemed, was ready to stake

00:11:28.904 --> 00:11:32.314
its future on this new company, Scotland’s

00:11:32.314 --> 00:11:34.674
answer to the East India Company

00:11:35.974 --> 00:11:38.424
Importantly, this new company

00:11:38.734 --> 00:11:41.337
had a pretty wide remit; it was

00:11:41.337 --> 00:11:43.257
intended to go on a bunch of

00:11:43.277 --> 00:11:45.417
different missions, not just Darién.

00:11:46.707 --> 00:11:50.747
And so in July 1698, the

00:11:50.757 --> 00:11:52.717
first ships set sail.

00:11:53.867 --> 00:11:56.127
There were five in total, carrying

00:11:56.137 --> 00:11:59.037
around 1,200 settlers, along with

00:11:59.047 --> 00:12:02.397
supplies, weapons, tools, and, of

00:12:02.397 --> 00:12:05.767
course, trade goods, mirrors, combs,

00:12:05.767 --> 00:12:08.617
woollen hats, items they believed they

00:12:08.617 --> 00:12:10.677
could exchange with local Indigenous

00:12:10.677 --> 00:12:13.167
populations or passing merchants.

00:12:14.527 --> 00:12:16.597
The first mistake they made was to

00:12:16.597 --> 00:12:19.817
set off from Edinburgh, not Glasgow.

00:12:20.377 --> 00:12:22.797
Now, in case you need a reminder

00:12:22.827 --> 00:12:25.297
of Scottish geography, both

00:12:25.377 --> 00:12:28.357
Edinburgh and Glasgow are by the

00:12:28.357 --> 00:12:31.747
sea, but Edinburgh is on the east

00:12:31.747 --> 00:12:34.897
coast and Glasgow is on the west.

00:12:35.997 --> 00:12:38.527
Setting off from Edinburgh meant

00:12:38.537 --> 00:12:41.207
going all the way around the north of

00:12:41.207 --> 00:12:44.147
Scotland, an often brutal journey, and

00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:46.917
in this case, one that took 4 months

00:12:46.947 --> 00:12:48.717
just to get around the British Isles.

00:12:49.917 --> 00:12:52.477
Nevertheless, spirits were high.

00:12:53.007 --> 00:12:55.007
The settlers were optimistic.

00:12:55.417 --> 00:12:57.667
They believed they were sailing towards

00:12:57.677 --> 00:13:00.217
a new chapter in Scottish history.

00:13:01.517 --> 00:13:03.377
But when they arrived at their

00:13:03.377 --> 00:13:06.187
destination, the Bay of Darién, on

00:13:06.187 --> 00:13:08.407
the Caribbean coast, they found a

00:13:08.407 --> 00:13:10.857
land that was far less promising

00:13:11.177 --> 00:13:13.157
than the dream they had bought into.

00:13:14.357 --> 00:13:17.377
There was no natural harbour, the

00:13:17.387 --> 00:13:20.567
ground was waterlogged and uneven,

00:13:21.137 --> 00:13:24.467
and the jungle was thick, hot,

00:13:24.707 --> 00:13:26.597
and full of unusual creatures.

00:13:28.207 --> 00:13:31.817
Worse still, the rainy season had begun,

00:13:32.347 --> 00:13:34.497
and their food supplies were already

00:13:34.497 --> 00:13:36.847
deteriorating in the humid climate.

00:13:38.297 --> 00:13:40.467
Still, they named their settlement

00:13:40.707 --> 00:13:42.637
New Edinburgh, hoisted the

00:13:42.637 --> 00:13:45.367
Scottish flag, and tried to build

00:13:45.367 --> 00:13:47.357
a colony from the ground up.

00:13:48.457 --> 00:13:50.777
They built a fort, which they called

00:13:50.787 --> 00:13:53.867
St. Andrew, but the place they chose

00:13:53.867 --> 00:13:56.577
for this had no fresh water source.

00:13:57.507 --> 00:13:59.357
And this was just one

00:13:59.367 --> 00:14:01.247
failure among hundreds.

00:14:01.847 --> 00:14:04.667
The Scots were, to put it simply,

00:14:05.037 --> 00:14:07.607
woefully unprepared for Darién.

00:14:08.377 --> 00:14:09.807
They had brought the wrong kind of

00:14:09.807 --> 00:14:12.137
supplies, luxury goods they wanted

00:14:12.137 --> 00:14:14.557
to trade rather than survival

00:14:14.557 --> 00:14:16.357
essentials to keep them alive.

00:14:17.317 --> 00:14:19.787
The indigenous Kuna people, who had

00:14:19.787 --> 00:14:22.117
lived in the region for centuries, had

00:14:22.117 --> 00:14:24.177
little interest in any of the products

00:14:24.407 --> 00:14:25.977
the Scots planned to trade with them.

00:14:26.937 --> 00:14:29.947
There was some contact, and they

00:14:29.947 --> 00:14:32.017
did share some water and supplies,

00:14:32.277 --> 00:14:34.557
but there was not nearly enough to

00:14:34.557 --> 00:14:36.297
support the Scottish settlement.

00:14:37.297 --> 00:14:39.927
Presumably, some assumed that these

00:14:40.097 --> 00:14:42.527
strange-looking foreigners would leave,

00:14:42.527 --> 00:14:44.857
or that the jungle would do its work.

00:14:46.139 --> 00:14:46.909
They didn’t have to

00:14:46.909 --> 00:14:48.369
wait particularly long.

00:14:49.449 --> 00:14:52.659
Most of the men had no idea how to

00:14:52.659 --> 00:14:55.399
survive in this kind of climate, and had

00:14:55.409 --> 00:14:58.209
no useful skills for life in the jungle.

00:14:59.179 --> 00:15:00.959
They might have been able to survive

00:15:00.959 --> 00:15:02.969
a night outdoors in the Scottish

00:15:02.969 --> 00:15:05.619
highlands, but a Central American

00:15:05.619 --> 00:15:08.209
jungle is something slightly different.

00:15:09.129 --> 00:15:12.719
Disease quickly set in: malaria,

00:15:13.049 --> 00:15:16.309
dysentery, fever, and within a

00:15:16.329 --> 00:15:18.369
few months, hundreds were dead,

00:15:18.699 --> 00:15:21.669
with 10 dying every single day.

00:15:23.112 --> 00:15:24.962
And the overland trade route?

00:15:25.052 --> 00:15:27.212
The grand plan to carry

00:15:27.212 --> 00:15:28.812
goods across the isthmus?

00:15:29.772 --> 00:15:31.212
It never got off the ground;

00:15:31.392 --> 00:15:33.302
they never even started it.

00:15:34.502 --> 00:15:36.732
Merely surviving was enough of a

00:15:36.732 --> 00:15:39.622
challenge, and one that hundreds failed

00:15:39.692 --> 00:15:42.762
to complete; it soon became obvious

00:15:42.782 --> 00:15:44.392
that clearing a path through the

00:15:44.392 --> 00:15:47.552
jungle and building a road, well, that

00:15:47.552 --> 00:15:49.772
was completely out of the question.

00:15:51.198 --> 00:15:53.168
And there was another problem.

00:15:53.778 --> 00:15:56.758
This territory, this land, had

00:15:56.848 --> 00:15:58.958
also been claimed by Spain.

00:16:00.168 --> 00:16:02.968
Granted, Spain had shown little interest

00:16:02.978 --> 00:16:05.738
in it because of how inhospitable it was.

00:16:06.278 --> 00:16:09.678
But the Spanish did not take kindly to

00:16:09.678 --> 00:16:12.908
a group of Scots planting a flag in what

00:16:12.918 --> 00:16:15.468
they considered to be their backyard.

00:16:16.278 --> 00:16:19.688
Now, initially, there was no significant

00:16:19.718 --> 00:16:21.828
military action on the part of Spain,

00:16:22.339 --> 00:16:25.068
and even if there had been, it would have

00:16:25.068 --> 00:16:28.628
been no competition; a fully-fledged army

00:16:28.888 --> 00:16:31.408
against a dwindling number of sunburnt,

00:16:31.638 --> 00:16:34.038
sickly and starving Scottish traders.

00:16:35.198 --> 00:16:37.148
After all, the biggest enemy

00:16:37.148 --> 00:16:39.668
the Scots faced wasn’t Spain.

00:16:40.238 --> 00:16:41.048
It was the jungle.

00:16:42.308 --> 00:16:45.218
By the summer of 1699, just

00:16:45.508 --> 00:16:47.588
eight months after arriving, the

00:16:47.588 --> 00:16:49.958
jungle had proved victorious.

00:16:51.118 --> 00:16:54.224
Of the 1,200 settlers who had

00:16:54.528 --> 00:16:57.988
set off, only 300 survived.

00:16:59.118 --> 00:17:01.818
They decided to cut their losses and

00:17:01.818 --> 00:17:04.278
sail back home with their tails between

00:17:04.278 --> 00:17:06.628
their legs, with the ships carrying

00:17:06.628 --> 00:17:09.108
more coffins than live passengers.

00:17:10.548 --> 00:17:13.488
But the story does not end there.

00:17:14.378 --> 00:17:17.358
Back in Scotland, news of the failure

00:17:17.608 --> 00:17:21.228
was slow to arrive, and before it

00:17:21.248 --> 00:17:24.848
did, a second expedition of 1,000

00:17:24.858 --> 00:17:27.908
more settlers had already set sail.

00:17:29.339 --> 00:17:32.348
It's difficult to overstate how

00:17:32.428 --> 00:17:35.208
tragic and almost surreal this was.

00:17:36.178 --> 00:17:38.578
The second group of settlers left

00:17:38.588 --> 00:17:40.748
Scotland believing they were going

00:17:40.748 --> 00:17:43.078
to reinforce a thriving colony.

00:17:43.668 --> 00:17:45.568
They brought ministers,

00:17:45.578 --> 00:17:47.968
schoolteachers, and musicians.

00:17:48.288 --> 00:17:49.948
They wrote letters full

00:17:49.948 --> 00:17:51.358
of hope and ambition.

00:17:52.258 --> 00:17:54.838
Some even saw it as a religious

00:17:54.838 --> 00:17:57.148
mission, a chance to build a

00:17:57.188 --> 00:17:59.538
godly society in a new world.

00:18:00.824 --> 00:18:02.874
When they arrived and found

00:18:02.904 --> 00:18:05.854
only ruins and graves, the shock

00:18:06.254 --> 00:18:07.964
must have been overwhelming.

00:18:09.144 --> 00:18:11.234
They tried to continue, but

00:18:11.484 --> 00:18:13.384
they were even worse prepared.

00:18:14.664 --> 00:18:17.374
After all, they thought they were going

00:18:17.424 --> 00:18:19.954
to join a bustling settlement rather

00:18:19.954 --> 00:18:22.234
than to have to start from scratch.

00:18:23.254 --> 00:18:25.814
And without fresh supplies, without

00:18:25.824 --> 00:18:28.654
leadership, and facing the same hostile

00:18:28.654 --> 00:18:31.054
conditions, it was only a matter of

00:18:31.054 --> 00:18:34.134
time before the same fate awaited them.

00:18:35.064 --> 00:18:37.724
Disease, hunger, and tropical

00:18:37.724 --> 00:18:40.004
hardships quickly took their toll.

00:18:41.274 --> 00:18:44.144
And the Spanish this time did

00:18:44.144 --> 00:18:46.004
decide that action was required.

00:18:46.999 --> 00:18:49.624
They blockaded the area, cutting off

00:18:49.674 --> 00:18:52.093
all potential routes for resupply.

00:18:53.024 --> 00:18:55.374
The Scots were given an ultimatum:

00:18:56.034 --> 00:18:58.514
surrender, or we’re coming to attack you.

00:18:59.814 --> 00:19:00.854
It can’t have been a

00:19:00.874 --> 00:19:02.694
particularly difficult decision.

00:19:03.794 --> 00:19:07.224
In March 1700, the remaining Scots

00:19:07.244 --> 00:19:10.214
surrendered, and fortunately, they

00:19:10.214 --> 00:19:12.304
were allowed to leave with their lives.

00:19:13.385 --> 00:19:15.685
It was a national disaster.

00:19:16.415 --> 00:19:17.515
The total cost of the

00:19:17.515 --> 00:19:19.275
Darién Scheme was enormous.

00:19:19.855 --> 00:19:22.605
The human cost was vast, with over

00:19:22.605 --> 00:19:25.635
2,000 people estimated to have died.

00:19:26.385 --> 00:19:29.595
And the financial losses were devastating.

00:19:30.285 --> 00:19:32.875
Almost every Scottish noble family

00:19:33.105 --> 00:19:36.385
had invested, and many were ruined.

00:19:37.205 --> 00:19:39.205
Many ordinary Scottish families,

00:19:39.595 --> 00:19:41.785
tradespeople who had put everything they

00:19:41.785 --> 00:19:44.935
had into the company, were left destitute.

00:19:46.345 --> 00:19:50.155
By some estimates, between a quarter and

00:19:50.185 --> 00:19:53.175
half of all the money in circulation in

00:19:53.175 --> 00:19:55.595
Scotland at that time had been invested

00:19:55.595 --> 00:19:59.275
in the scheme and, puff, it was gone.

00:20:00.435 --> 00:20:03.015
The economy was shattered, public

00:20:03.045 --> 00:20:06.475
confidence was destroyed, and the dream of

00:20:06.475 --> 00:20:09.415
becoming a global trading power was dead.

00:20:10.735 --> 00:20:12.975
Ordinary people were devastated.

00:20:13.345 --> 00:20:15.945
Entire communities had pooled money

00:20:16.155 --> 00:20:18.055
to invest in the Company of Scotland.

00:20:18.415 --> 00:20:20.465
Families had lost sons,

00:20:20.685 --> 00:20:22.485
brothers, husbands.

00:20:22.725 --> 00:20:24.465
The failure was not just

00:20:24.475 --> 00:20:27.105
financial; it was deeply personal.

00:20:28.275 --> 00:20:31.425
There was public outrage, accusations of

00:20:31.435 --> 00:20:34.655
corruption, and cries for accountability.

00:20:35.535 --> 00:20:38.065
And yet, there is another part to this

00:20:38.065 --> 00:20:40.485
story, one that fuelled resentment

00:20:40.675 --> 00:20:42.705
and lasting bitterness in Scotland.

00:20:43.675 --> 00:20:45.675
Yes, the conditions were

00:20:45.675 --> 00:20:47.545
incredibly hostile, and the

00:20:47.545 --> 00:20:49.795
Scots were utterly unprepared.

00:20:50.175 --> 00:20:52.245
But there was another factor.

00:20:53.225 --> 00:20:56.225
England, partly not to annoy Spain and

00:20:56.495 --> 00:20:58.525
partly to protect the interests of its

00:20:58.585 --> 00:21:01.305
own East India Company, had quietly

00:21:01.335 --> 00:21:04.815
ordered its colonies not to offer any

00:21:04.815 --> 00:21:07.025
support to the Scottish expedition.

00:21:08.075 --> 00:21:09.735
Ports in Jamaica and

00:21:09.735 --> 00:21:12.215
Barbados were closed to them.

00:21:12.755 --> 00:21:14.735
English ships were forbidden

00:21:14.945 --> 00:21:16.405
from trading with the colony.

00:21:16.995 --> 00:21:18.105
Even supplies and

00:21:18.115 --> 00:21:20.045
medical aid were refused.

00:21:21.395 --> 00:21:24.955
Many Scots saw this as a betrayal; not

00:21:24.955 --> 00:21:28.095
just indifference, but active sabotage.

00:21:28.785 --> 00:21:31.065
The sense that England had abandoned

00:21:31.075 --> 00:21:33.405
the scheme, or even deliberately

00:21:33.435 --> 00:21:36.075
undermined it, this only deepened

00:21:36.085 --> 00:21:38.335
the wounds when it all fell apart.

00:21:39.468 --> 00:21:42.642
And to make matters worse, quiet,

00:21:43.018 --> 00:21:45.028
desperate calculations were

00:21:45.038 --> 00:21:46.608
being made in the background.

00:21:47.648 --> 00:21:49.538
Scotland was broke.

00:21:49.668 --> 00:21:52.468
Its political class was facing ruin.

00:21:53.728 --> 00:21:56.148
England offered it a lifeline.

00:21:56.998 --> 00:21:59.468
It would offer financial compensation

00:21:59.478 --> 00:22:03.018
for the losses, but part of this deal

00:22:03.298 --> 00:22:06.148
was that Scotland would sign the Acts

00:22:06.198 --> 00:22:09.088
of the Union, establishing the Kingdom

00:22:09.118 --> 00:22:12.128
of Great Britain, and bringing Scotland

00:22:12.308 --> 00:22:14.968
and England together as one country.

00:22:16.452 --> 00:22:20.072
To many in Scotland, this was the only

00:22:20.132 --> 00:22:24.652
viable path forward, and in 1707, just

00:22:24.652 --> 00:22:27.482
a few years after the final failure in

00:22:27.532 --> 00:22:30.632
Panama, the Acts of Union were signed,

00:22:31.022 --> 00:22:32.732
creating the Kingdom of Great Britain.

00:22:34.212 --> 00:22:36.932
The result was a union forged

00:22:36.962 --> 00:22:39.262
not in triumph, but in the

00:22:39.312 --> 00:22:41.672
ashes of a national catastrophe.

00:22:42.894 --> 00:22:45.244
The Darién Scheme, for all its

00:22:45.244 --> 00:22:47.434
ambition and vision, did not

00:22:47.444 --> 00:22:49.344
just fail to create a colony.

00:22:49.784 --> 00:22:52.474
It played a not insignificant part

00:22:52.754 --> 00:22:55.114
in the end of Scotland’s independence

00:22:55.344 --> 00:22:57.574
and forced it into an alliance

00:22:57.734 --> 00:23:00.114
with its historical greatest enemy.

00:23:01.054 --> 00:23:04.274
So, to wrap things up, what can we take

00:23:04.434 --> 00:23:07.494
from this ill-fated attempt by Scotland to

00:23:07.524 --> 00:23:10.344
carve out its own Central American colony?

00:23:11.264 --> 00:23:13.534
Clearly, one obvious lesson might

00:23:13.534 --> 00:23:15.304
be “mind your own business and

00:23:15.304 --> 00:23:16.824
don’t try to colonise other people”.

00:23:17.604 --> 00:23:19.854
That is certainly a valid takeaway.

00:23:20.554 --> 00:23:22.534
The Darién Scheme was, after

00:23:22.534 --> 00:23:24.824
all, a colonial project, one that

00:23:24.854 --> 00:23:27.194
conveniently ignored the interests

00:23:27.204 --> 00:23:29.064
and sovereignty of the Indigenous

00:23:29.064 --> 00:23:30.634
peoples who already lived there.

00:23:31.274 --> 00:23:34.534
But perhaps there are other lessons too.

00:23:35.454 --> 00:23:39.344
One is the danger of unchecked optimism.

00:23:40.204 --> 00:23:41.864
The enthusiasm for the scheme in

00:23:41.864 --> 00:23:45.464
Scotland was so overwhelming, so total,

00:23:45.844 --> 00:23:48.834
that few people asked hard questions.

00:23:49.344 --> 00:23:52.814
There was little scrutiny, no serious

00:23:52.844 --> 00:23:55.914
contingency planning, and almost no

00:23:55.924 --> 00:23:58.304
real understanding of the land or

00:23:58.344 --> 00:24:00.384
people they were trying to settle among.

00:24:00.794 --> 00:24:02.774
The national mood swept

00:24:02.774 --> 00:24:04.154
away reason and caution.

00:24:05.324 --> 00:24:07.734
Another is the risk of putting all

00:24:07.734 --> 00:24:10.524
your hopes in a single, grand solution.

00:24:11.504 --> 00:24:14.564
For many Scots, this one project was

00:24:14.564 --> 00:24:17.324
meant to solve everything: to rescue

00:24:17.324 --> 00:24:20.354
the economy, to restore pride, to

00:24:20.544 --> 00:24:23.344
assert independence on the global stage.

00:24:24.224 --> 00:24:26.734
But when it failed, there

00:24:26.734 --> 00:24:28.124
was nothing to fall back on.

00:24:28.804 --> 00:24:30.494
The collapse of Darién took

00:24:30.504 --> 00:24:32.024
the entire country with it.

00:24:33.123 --> 00:24:35.623
And finally, perhaps there is the lesson

00:24:35.633 --> 00:24:38.343
that history is rarely clean or fair.

00:24:39.153 --> 00:24:41.023
The scheme’s failure wasn’t just

00:24:41.053 --> 00:24:43.503
caused by poor planning or disease.

00:24:43.893 --> 00:24:45.683
It was also undermined by

00:24:45.713 --> 00:24:48.313
geopolitical forces beyond Scotland’s

00:24:48.313 --> 00:24:50.833
control: by England’s refusal

00:24:50.843 --> 00:24:53.193
to support it, and by Spain’s

00:24:53.233 --> 00:24:55.563
determination to defend its empire.

00:24:56.273 --> 00:24:57.983
The Scots were caught in the

00:24:57.983 --> 00:24:59.643
middle of a much bigger game.

00:25:00.813 --> 00:25:03.923
So what started as a bold attempt to

00:25:03.923 --> 00:25:06.533
reshape the world ended in disaster.

00:25:07.213 --> 00:25:10.593
But it did reshape something — not

00:25:10.663 --> 00:25:12.733
global trade, but the political

00:25:12.733 --> 00:25:14.723
map of the British Isles.

00:25:15.963 --> 00:25:18.183
OK, then, that is it for today's

00:25:18.203 --> 00:25:20.343
episode on The Darien Scheme.

00:25:20.773 --> 00:25:22.093
I hope it's been an interesting one

00:25:22.383 --> 00:25:24.173
and that you've learnt something new.

00:25:24.763 --> 00:25:26.553
We actually have lots of listeners

00:25:26.563 --> 00:25:28.733
from Colombia, and a fair few from

00:25:28.753 --> 00:25:31.583
Panama too, so particularly if this

00:25:31.583 --> 00:25:33.203
subject is close to home for you,

00:25:33.703 --> 00:25:34.913
I’d love to know what you thought.

00:25:35.093 --> 00:25:36.603
Did you know this story?

00:25:37.033 --> 00:25:39.293
How does it make you feel, and what

00:25:39.303 --> 00:25:40.793
do you think we can take from it?

00:25:41.323 --> 00:25:42.403
You can head right into our

00:25:42.403 --> 00:25:44.143
community forum, which is at

00:25:44.143 --> 00:25:47.003
