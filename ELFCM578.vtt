Hello, hello, hello, and welcome

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:09.680
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.510
Minds, by Leonardo English, the show

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.429
where you can listen to fascinating

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.850
stories and learn weird and wonderful

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.860
things about the world at the same

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.739
time as improving your English.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.100
I'm Alastair Budge, and today it’s

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.110
part two of our three-part mini-series

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.110
on the theme of “university”.

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:32.150
In case you missed part one, it was on

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.269
the history of the university, from its

00:00:34.349 --> 00:00:37.190
earliest days in medieval Europe, through

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.559
to the colossal industry it is today.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.520
Next up, in part three, we’ll be

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.550
looking at the scandal of Trump

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.740
University, the university that,

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:48.989
legally speaking, is no longer

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
allowed to call itself a university.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.589
But today we will be talking

00:00:53.599 --> 00:00:55.529
about universities in the UK.

00:00:56.249 --> 00:00:57.989
How do they work, how are they

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.799
different from universities in

00:00:59.889 --> 00:01:02.119
other countries, and what is life

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:04.089
like at university in Britain?

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.069
Perhaps surprisingly, I’ve had many

00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:09.689
requests to make this sort of episode,

00:01:09.919 --> 00:01:12.059
often from people who are considering

00:01:12.129 --> 00:01:14.869
applying to study at a British university.

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:17.619
So if this is you, I hope it’ll be

00:01:17.629 --> 00:01:19.899
interesting, and even if you have

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:22.709
absolutely no intention of ever

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:25.149
studying at a British university, I

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:27.299
hope it’ll be interesting nonetheless.

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:29.779
OK then, with that out of the

00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:31.989
way, let’s get right into it.

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:34.869
It is a perfectly reasonable

00:01:34.879 --> 00:01:37.619
statement to say that, as far as

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.039
its place on the world stage goes,

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:42.869
the UK is not what it once was.

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:46.069
From global politics to economic

00:01:46.089 --> 00:01:48.509
power, the UK is clearly less

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:50.559
important than at almost any

00:01:50.559 --> 00:01:53.389
stage in the past 500 years or so.

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:56.419
However, there is one area

00:01:56.589 --> 00:01:58.979
in which the UK still packs a

00:01:59.019 --> 00:02:01.739
sizable punch: higher education.

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:03.179
Its universities.

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:07.649
Out of the top 10 universities worldwide,

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.459
according to the most recent QS World

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:14.169
University Rankings, the UK has four.

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:18.459
The US has another four, and the remaining

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.039
two are ETH Zurich, in Switzerland, and

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:23.989
the National University of Singapore.

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:27.509
The UK is home to some of the best

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:31.139
universities in the world, and the 150

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:33.909
or so universities in the UK educate

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.129
almost 3 million students every year.

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.609
To put it another way, one out of

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:43.959
every 23 people in the UK is currently

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:47.549
enrolled at a university, and according

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:51.409
to the most recent census, 1 in 3 adults

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:54.289
in the UK has a university degree.

00:02:55.169 --> 00:02:58.169
I am one of them, and in fact, I have

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:00.309
degrees from two different British

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:03.649
universities, so in this episode, I will

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.709
talk you through what it is like to study

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:09.059
at a British university more generally,

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:11.569
as well as share my own experience.

00:03:12.529 --> 00:03:15.229
So, let’s start at the beginning, and

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:17.639
here I’ll give you some background

00:03:17.929 --> 00:03:20.419
to how education works in the UK.

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:24.759
In the UK, education is compulsory

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.639
up until the year you turn 18.

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:30.369
But it’s compulsory with

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:32.709
a caveat, an exception.

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:38.249
When you are 15 or 16, most people take

00:03:38.279 --> 00:03:41.159
exams called General Certificate of

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:44.789
Secondary Education, or GCSEs for short.

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:48.729
Some subjects are compulsory, like

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:51.559
English and Maths, but there is an

00:03:51.679 --> 00:03:54.919
element of choice, so not everyone needs

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:58.649
to study drama or French or philosophy,

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:02.149
or things that are deemed less vital.

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:05.879
You can leave the traditional school

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:09.309
system after this, but technically you

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:11.679
need to enrol in some form of training:

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:14.309
an apprenticeship or something like that.

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:17.219
If you want to go to university,

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.809
you have to continue for two more

00:04:19.809 --> 00:04:22.679
years and study for your A-levels.

00:04:23.549 --> 00:04:26.189
86% of people do this, according

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:28.009
to the latest government data.

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:32.929
Here, you drop a bunch of subjects that

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:35.129
you would have studied for your GCSEs,

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:38.169
and you only choose your favourites,

00:04:38.519 --> 00:04:41.049
the ones you are best at, or perhaps the

00:04:41.049 --> 00:04:43.519
ones your parents insist you must do.

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:47.859
Most students choose three or

00:04:47.859 --> 00:04:50.559
four subjects, and it’s already

00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:52.869
at this point that a student needs

00:04:52.869 --> 00:04:54.529
to be thinking about what they

00:04:54.549 --> 00:04:56.919
might want to study at university.

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:00.669
In your final year at school, so

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:03.329
the year you turn 18, you need

00:05:03.329 --> 00:05:05.269
to start the application process.

00:05:06.269 --> 00:05:09.129
In Britain, this all happens through

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:12.119
a centralised system called the UCAS,

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:14.379
which stands for the Universities

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:16.529
and Colleges Admissions Service.

00:05:17.079 --> 00:05:20.529
Essentially UCAS is a middleman, and

00:05:20.769 --> 00:05:22.939
allows you to apply to up to five

00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:25.819
universities in one go, all together.

00:05:26.649 --> 00:05:28.009
You don’t write to every

00:05:28.024 --> 00:05:29.879
university individually.

00:05:30.519 --> 00:05:33.579
Now, not every university has every

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:36.169
course, and some universities are

00:05:36.249 --> 00:05:38.779
particularly well-known for certain

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:40.539
courses and weaker in others.

00:05:41.239 --> 00:05:44.049
So, there is typically someone at your

00:05:44.059 --> 00:05:46.869
school who will help you figure out

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:49.259
whether university is right for you,

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:52.599
which courses could be a good fit, which

00:05:52.709 --> 00:05:55.169
universities to apply for, and generally

00:05:55.249 --> 00:05:57.889
guide you through the application process.

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:01.629
So, you choose your five universities

00:06:02.079 --> 00:06:03.709
and the courses you’d like to apply for.

00:06:04.369 --> 00:06:06.659
In terms of how the application process

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:10.749
works, your school includes your grades

00:06:10.749 --> 00:06:13.879
so far, as well as your predicted grades

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:16.869
at A-Level, your predicted final grades.

00:06:17.839 --> 00:06:19.259
Of course, there are all of your

00:06:19.349 --> 00:06:21.709
personal details, and then the other

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:24.469
important bit is the personal statement.

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:29.299
This is a single essay, up to 4,000

00:06:29.339 --> 00:06:32.369
characters long, so roughly one side

00:06:32.369 --> 00:06:36.399
of A4, where you have to explain why

00:06:36.579 --> 00:06:38.879
you want to study that subject, what

00:06:38.879 --> 00:06:41.819
makes you suitable, and what wider

00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:44.629
reading or experiences you’ve had.

00:06:45.619 --> 00:06:47.859
Alongside a written reference from

00:06:47.859 --> 00:06:50.619
your teachers, essentially a letter

00:06:50.619 --> 00:06:52.889
of recommendation, and your predicted

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:56.079
grades for your A-levels, then this is

00:06:56.149 --> 00:06:59.309
all sent off to your chosen universities.

00:07:00.189 --> 00:07:02.199
Then you…wait.

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:04.889
The most selective universities

00:07:05.269 --> 00:07:07.159
also require you to come and

00:07:07.169 --> 00:07:08.919
have a series of interviews.

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:13.049
In my case, I applied for Oxford,

00:07:13.359 --> 00:07:15.079
University College London–or

00:07:15.079 --> 00:07:19.489
UCL–Bristol, Exeter, and I think

00:07:19.499 --> 00:07:20.959
Manchester was the last one.

00:07:21.559 --> 00:07:24.089
I was invited to interviews at both

00:07:24.159 --> 00:07:27.189
Oxford and UCL, where I was grilled

00:07:27.219 --> 00:07:29.219
on my motivations to study there,

00:07:29.629 --> 00:07:31.589
asked about things I’d included in

00:07:31.589 --> 00:07:33.629
my personal statement, and so on.

00:07:34.489 --> 00:07:37.049
My interviews at Oxford didn’t

00:07:37.059 --> 00:07:39.149
go very well, but my interviews

00:07:39.149 --> 00:07:41.289
at UCL did go pretty well.

00:07:41.859 --> 00:07:44.389
And sure enough, I was offered a

00:07:44.389 --> 00:07:47.479
place at UCL, but not by Oxford, thank

00:07:47.479 --> 00:07:49.409
you, but no thank you, I was told.

00:07:50.089 --> 00:07:52.329
The other universities, which were

00:07:52.329 --> 00:07:54.799
still good but not ranked quite as

00:07:54.799 --> 00:07:57.239
highly as Oxford and UCL, didn’t

00:07:57.299 --> 00:07:59.209
ask me for an interview, but

00:07:59.449 --> 00:08:01.289
offered me a place in any case.

00:08:02.449 --> 00:08:06.129
And here is a peculiarity of UK

00:08:06.139 --> 00:08:08.379
universities, or that might be

00:08:08.409 --> 00:08:10.539
different to how university works

00:08:10.679 --> 00:08:13.199
in your country: the place you

00:08:13.199 --> 00:08:15.699
are given is usually conditional.

00:08:16.449 --> 00:08:18.769
That means the university will say,

00:08:19.199 --> 00:08:20.949
“We will give you a place on this

00:08:20.979 --> 00:08:24.159
course, but only if you get these

00:08:24.159 --> 00:08:26.869
grades in your final A-level exams.”

00:08:27.659 --> 00:08:30.459
And if you have multiple offers, they

00:08:30.459 --> 00:08:32.619
might have different grade requirements.

00:08:33.149 --> 00:08:36.252
So you might have an offer from UCL

00:08:36.252 --> 00:08:38.452
that says you need to get three As,

00:08:38.562 --> 00:08:40.579
or one from Bristol that says you

00:08:40.579 --> 00:08:42.799
need two As and a B, but you need

00:08:42.809 --> 00:08:45.009
to get an A in a particular subject.

00:08:45.799 --> 00:08:47.579
When the exam results come

00:08:47.609 --> 00:08:50.129
out in August, if you get the

00:08:50.129 --> 00:08:52.589
grades, your place is confirmed.

00:08:53.049 --> 00:08:55.619
If you don’t, you may lose your

00:08:55.619 --> 00:08:57.879
spot, but there is a system called

00:08:57.949 --> 00:09:00.499
Clearing that matches students with

00:09:00.509 --> 00:09:02.839
universities that have spaces available.

00:09:03.729 --> 00:09:06.099
And what happens if you don’t get any

00:09:06.099 --> 00:09:08.239
offers from your chosen universities?

00:09:08.769 --> 00:09:12.489
Well, this should be quite unlikely.

00:09:12.859 --> 00:09:15.329
Someone at your school should have

00:09:15.329 --> 00:09:18.089
advised you on the types of universities

00:09:18.369 --> 00:09:20.689
to apply for, given your grades.

00:09:21.539 --> 00:09:23.639
If you have excellent grades, then

00:09:23.659 --> 00:09:25.349
you should be encouraged to apply

00:09:25.369 --> 00:09:28.019
for the best universities, and if

00:09:28.019 --> 00:09:30.989
your grades are not so good, then you

00:09:30.989 --> 00:09:33.369
should be pushed towards universities

00:09:33.369 --> 00:09:35.169
that are more likely to accept you.

00:09:35.879 --> 00:09:38.459
So, you’ve got your offer, you’ve got the

00:09:38.459 --> 00:09:41.039
required grades, and you’re ready to go.

00:09:41.919 --> 00:09:44.789
Most British students move away

00:09:44.799 --> 00:09:47.719
from home to go to university; it’s

00:09:47.739 --> 00:09:50.739
unlike many European countries, where

00:09:51.069 --> 00:09:53.189
most students will go to the closest

00:09:53.189 --> 00:09:55.159
university and still live at home.

00:09:56.249 --> 00:09:59.069
In the UK, people typically move away

00:09:59.069 --> 00:10:01.269
from home and will spend their first

00:10:01.289 --> 00:10:03.749
year in what’s called a “halls of

00:10:03.749 --> 00:10:06.529
residence”, essentially a large building

00:10:06.749 --> 00:10:09.199
with a mixture of single and double

00:10:09.199 --> 00:10:11.189
rooms, depending on the university.

00:10:12.439 --> 00:10:15.639
And as to what life is like in one of

00:10:15.639 --> 00:10:18.629
these halls of residence, well, if you

00:10:18.629 --> 00:10:22.219
put 500 or so British 18-year-olds in a

00:10:22.229 --> 00:10:24.979
building together, many of whom have never

00:10:24.979 --> 00:10:27.559
left home and who might have just received

00:10:27.559 --> 00:10:29.199
their first batch of their student

00:10:29.209 --> 00:10:31.999
loans, well, I’m sure you can imagine

00:10:32.129 --> 00:10:34.349
a little of what life might be like.

00:10:35.259 --> 00:10:37.099
And on that subject, we

00:10:37.099 --> 00:10:38.839
must talk about finances.

00:10:39.559 --> 00:10:42.209
As you may know already, or might

00:10:42.239 --> 00:10:44.189
remember from the last episode,

00:10:44.469 --> 00:10:46.809
there are some quite hefty tuition

00:10:46.809 --> 00:10:48.719
fees at British universities.

00:10:49.929 --> 00:10:52.529
University was completely free until

00:10:52.539 --> 00:10:56.469
1997, then it was £1,000 a year, which

00:10:56.499 --> 00:10:58.309
was what I was lucky enough to pay,

00:10:58.859 --> 00:11:02.209
then it was increased to £3,000 for

00:11:02.219 --> 00:11:04.759
applications after 2004, and then

00:11:04.759 --> 00:11:09.059
increased again to £9,000 in 2012.

00:11:09.849 --> 00:11:12.809
Interestingly and importantly, Scotland

00:11:13.009 --> 00:11:15.439
is different; if you are from Scotland,

00:11:15.889 --> 00:11:18.769
your home is in Scotland, the Scottish

00:11:18.789 --> 00:11:21.149
government pays for your university

00:11:21.149 --> 00:11:23.959
fees, if you go to a Scottish university.

00:11:24.809 --> 00:11:27.409
If you go to an English university, you

00:11:27.409 --> 00:11:30.539
pay the standard English tuition fees,

00:11:30.939 --> 00:11:34.039
and people from England going to Scottish

00:11:34.039 --> 00:11:36.549
universities have to pay the standard

00:11:36.769 --> 00:11:39.519
tuition fees, they don’t get free tuition.

00:11:40.119 --> 00:11:42.429
So most students from Scotland

00:11:42.849 --> 00:11:45.059
stay in Scotland for university,

00:11:45.119 --> 00:11:46.979
because they save on the fees.

00:11:48.079 --> 00:11:51.389
And as for international students, well,

00:11:51.789 --> 00:11:54.459
the sky is the limit in terms of fees.

00:11:54.809 --> 00:11:56.409
There is no government cap,

00:11:56.719 --> 00:11:59.229
so universities are free to

00:11:59.229 --> 00:12:01.039
charge as much as they like.

00:12:01.779 --> 00:12:04.579
For example, if you are an international

00:12:04.579 --> 00:12:06.599
student and you’d like to study

00:12:06.609 --> 00:12:09.409
medicine at Cambridge, it will cost

00:12:09.409 --> 00:12:15.769
you £58,000 a year, so that’s €66,000.

00:12:16.869 --> 00:12:18.519
I’ll be talking about domestic,

00:12:18.769 --> 00:12:21.059
British students here, but that’s

00:12:21.059 --> 00:12:22.779
how it works for international

00:12:22.779 --> 00:12:24.759
students, as a point of comparison.

00:12:25.879 --> 00:12:28.209
Living costs are a separate thing

00:12:28.249 --> 00:12:31.129
altogether, and most students will

00:12:31.129 --> 00:12:33.079
take out a loan from the government,

00:12:33.279 --> 00:12:35.919
from a government-owned not-for-profit

00:12:35.939 --> 00:12:37.839
organisation that gives out what are

00:12:37.839 --> 00:12:39.959
called maintenance loans to students.

00:12:40.639 --> 00:12:44.119
OK, so we’ve arrived at university, found

00:12:44.139 --> 00:12:46.269
our halls of residence, paid for our

00:12:46.269 --> 00:12:48.919
course and got our first loan payment.

00:12:49.329 --> 00:12:49.969
What next?

00:12:50.879 --> 00:12:52.969
All universities will have something

00:12:52.969 --> 00:12:54.859
called “freshers week”, which is

00:12:54.859 --> 00:12:57.459
basically a huge party week for

00:12:57.499 --> 00:12:59.579
all new undergraduate students,

00:12:59.849 --> 00:13:02.019
freshmen, or freshers for short.

00:13:03.259 --> 00:13:05.099
And then begins the actual

00:13:05.129 --> 00:13:06.419
business of studying.

00:13:07.439 --> 00:13:09.879
Most undergraduate courses are

00:13:09.949 --> 00:13:12.609
three years, some are four, and

00:13:12.619 --> 00:13:15.029
more specialised ones like medicine

00:13:15.319 --> 00:13:18.159
take 5 or 6, with additional

00:13:18.299 --> 00:13:20.369
specialisations taking even longer.

00:13:21.039 --> 00:13:22.259
One of my best friends from

00:13:22.259 --> 00:13:24.279
university specialised in

00:13:24.329 --> 00:13:27.149
neuroscience, and he has only just

00:13:27.209 --> 00:13:28.919
technically finished his studies.

00:13:29.439 --> 00:13:32.409
And we both started in 2006.

00:13:33.919 --> 00:13:35.899
An important distinction between

00:13:35.919 --> 00:13:38.339
British universities and universities

00:13:38.429 --> 00:13:41.539
elsewhere, for example in the US, is

00:13:41.539 --> 00:13:44.479
that in the UK you start your course

00:13:44.759 --> 00:13:47.349
immediately; you don’t take a series of

00:13:47.459 --> 00:13:50.119
general modules in your first year and

00:13:50.179 --> 00:13:52.489
later decide what you specialise in.

00:13:53.409 --> 00:13:55.999
You apply for a course, in my case,

00:13:56.189 --> 00:13:58.889
French and Italian, and within that

00:13:58.889 --> 00:14:01.189
course, there are certain modules

00:14:01.189 --> 00:14:04.769
you can take: Dante or 19th century

00:14:04.779 --> 00:14:06.449
French literature, for example.

00:14:07.109 --> 00:14:10.389
You can’t apply for History and then

00:14:10.619 --> 00:14:12.469
decide you’d like to take a module on

00:14:12.889 --> 00:14:15.369
advanced statistics or microbiology.

00:14:15.969 --> 00:14:17.849
You’d have to drop out of the course,

00:14:18.259 --> 00:14:21.159
reapply, and start it all over again.

00:14:22.079 --> 00:14:24.619
Another peculiarity of many

00:14:24.659 --> 00:14:26.719
British university courses is

00:14:26.719 --> 00:14:28.979
that there really isn’t that much

00:14:28.979 --> 00:14:31.669
time spent in lectures, in class.

00:14:32.939 --> 00:14:35.539
I think I had around 10 hours of

00:14:35.539 --> 00:14:38.209
lectures per week for my class.

00:14:38.799 --> 00:14:40.924
It might not sound like much at all,

00:14:41.393 --> 00:14:44.409
especially if you are paying €10,000

00:14:44.439 --> 00:14:47.259
a year for the privilege, but the

00:14:47.299 --> 00:14:49.629
expectation is that you do a lot

00:14:49.669 --> 00:14:52.369
of self-study and reading around

00:14:52.379 --> 00:14:54.479
the subject in the remaining time.

00:14:55.319 --> 00:14:57.779
Of course, not every university is

00:14:57.779 --> 00:15:00.819
the same, but especially at the more

00:15:01.009 --> 00:15:03.969
selective universities, a lot of your

00:15:03.969 --> 00:15:07.029
time will be spent reading and studying

00:15:07.319 --> 00:15:09.599
on your own, and then your contact

00:15:09.609 --> 00:15:11.969
time with a professor will be spent in

00:15:12.019 --> 00:15:14.729
discussion, and you are expected to have

00:15:14.729 --> 00:15:16.979
done extensive preparation beforehand.

00:15:18.039 --> 00:15:21.269
As part of my university studies, I did an

00:15:21.269 --> 00:15:24.599
ERASMUS exchange and studied at university

00:15:24.989 --> 00:15:27.969
both in Lyon, in France, and Naples, in

00:15:27.999 --> 00:15:32.209
Italy, and I had considerably more contact

00:15:32.219 --> 00:15:34.659
time with professors in both places,

00:15:35.099 --> 00:15:38.049
but it was a very different style of

00:15:38.079 --> 00:15:41.439
teaching; much more based on the professor

00:15:41.969 --> 00:15:43.869
standing in front of a large group of

00:15:43.869 --> 00:15:46.489
students and imparting their knowledge

00:15:46.859 --> 00:15:50.064
to them rather than my experience at UCL,

00:15:50.379 --> 00:15:53.099
which was much more collaborative: small

00:15:53.099 --> 00:15:55.729
groups, back and forth discussion, and

00:15:55.999 --> 00:15:58.909
more work out of the classroom than in.

00:15:59.859 --> 00:16:02.549
So, that may or may not be

00:16:02.549 --> 00:16:04.389
different from what university is

00:16:04.499 --> 00:16:06.329
typically like in your country.

00:16:07.409 --> 00:16:10.269
Another potential difference is that

00:16:10.609 --> 00:16:13.409
in the UK, at most universities at

00:16:13.409 --> 00:16:17.069
least, most modules run all the time.

00:16:17.989 --> 00:16:19.689
In other words, you will be doing

00:16:19.759 --> 00:16:21.979
all of your modules at the same time,

00:16:22.529 --> 00:16:24.789
slowly over the course of the year.

00:16:25.859 --> 00:16:28.699
My wife is a lecturer at a university

00:16:28.709 --> 00:16:31.409
in Sweden, and with her course,

00:16:31.749 --> 00:16:34.269
students take one module at a time

00:16:34.529 --> 00:16:37.929
very intensively, so every day there

00:16:37.929 --> 00:16:40.259
will be a lecture or some form of

00:16:40.269 --> 00:16:43.849
tuition, but only for a period of a few

00:16:43.849 --> 00:16:46.039
weeks, before they move on to another.

00:16:47.149 --> 00:16:49.819
So, let’s move forward with our studies.

00:16:50.419 --> 00:16:52.819
Depending on the course, students will

00:16:52.819 --> 00:16:55.349
have a mixture of ongoing coursework

00:16:55.409 --> 00:16:57.659
and exams at the end of the year.

00:16:58.609 --> 00:17:02.489
In my case, it was almost all exam-based.

00:17:03.129 --> 00:17:05.589
My course was four years, which

00:17:05.589 --> 00:17:07.789
included a year spent studying abroad,

00:17:08.289 --> 00:17:11.169
and each year counted progressively

00:17:11.199 --> 00:17:13.329
more towards my final mark.

00:17:13.939 --> 00:17:16.649
The first year was 10%, the

00:17:16.649 --> 00:17:19.709
second 15%, the third another

00:17:19.709 --> 00:17:23.275
15%, and the final year 60%.

00:17:23.519 --> 00:17:25.989
Or something like that, and of

00:17:25.989 --> 00:17:27.789
course, every university and

00:17:27.789 --> 00:17:29.859
course will be slightly different.

00:17:31.009 --> 00:17:34.979
And on the subject of marks, the UK

00:17:35.179 --> 00:17:37.709
has a very specific grading system.

00:17:38.589 --> 00:17:41.469
The top mark is a “first class”

00:17:41.469 --> 00:17:44.729
degree, which is anything over 70.

00:17:45.439 --> 00:17:47.849
Then you can have an “upper second

00:17:47.889 --> 00:17:50.789
class” degree, or 2:1, which is a mark

00:17:50.819 --> 00:17:54.569
in the 60s, a “lower class” degree, a

00:17:54.599 --> 00:17:57.919
2:2, which is in the 50s, or a third

00:17:57.919 --> 00:18:00.719
class degree, which is in the 40s.

00:18:01.559 --> 00:18:03.789
Now, you might be listening to this and

00:18:03.789 --> 00:18:06.329
thinking, “Hang on, you only need to

00:18:06.329 --> 00:18:09.099
get a mark of 70 to get the top grade?”

00:18:09.779 --> 00:18:12.339
In many university systems, students

00:18:12.349 --> 00:18:14.819
get almost full marks, like an

00:18:14.819 --> 00:18:17.559
Italian getting 30 out of 30 or

00:18:17.859 --> 00:18:20.892
an American getting a GPA of 4.0.

00:18:21.399 --> 00:18:23.589
If your university was like this,

00:18:24.029 --> 00:18:26.939
I can imagine a mark of 70 sounds

00:18:27.009 --> 00:18:28.569
like nothing to write home about,

00:18:28.839 --> 00:18:30.459
nothing particularly special.

00:18:31.239 --> 00:18:32.709
Not in the UK.

00:18:33.789 --> 00:18:36.439
When I graduated, only around

00:18:36.599 --> 00:18:39.749
10% of people got 70 and above.

00:18:40.419 --> 00:18:42.769
Around half got an “upper second

00:18:42.769 --> 00:18:44.612
class” degree, which is what I

00:18:44.612 --> 00:18:47.319
got, and the rest got lower second

00:18:47.319 --> 00:18:49.239
class or third class degrees.

00:18:49.899 --> 00:18:53.099
So getting a mark above 70 is not

00:18:53.159 --> 00:18:55.489
easy, and it’s incredibly rare

00:18:55.689 --> 00:18:57.942
for a student to get above 80.

00:18:58.489 --> 00:19:01.579
In my year, nobody got a mark of

00:19:01.579 --> 00:19:04.211
above 80, and this has included

00:19:04.211 --> 00:19:05.759
people who have gone on to teach

00:19:05.759 --> 00:19:07.999
at places like Cambridge and Yale.

00:19:08.699 --> 00:19:11.039
OK, so we have now graduated from

00:19:11.049 --> 00:19:13.799
a British university, well done us!

00:19:14.259 --> 00:19:14.959
What next?

00:19:15.599 --> 00:19:17.949
Well, the real world of gainful

00:19:17.959 --> 00:19:20.779
employment is waiting for us, or you

00:19:20.779 --> 00:19:22.529
might choose to continue studying.

00:19:23.549 --> 00:19:25.789
In my case, I did a Master’s

00:19:25.789 --> 00:19:28.159
degree, partly because I had become

00:19:28.189 --> 00:19:29.989
particularly interested in China

00:19:29.999 --> 00:19:32.809
and in learning Mandarin, and partly

00:19:33.049 --> 00:19:34.469
because I didn’t have a concrete

00:19:34.499 --> 00:19:36.679
idea of what I wanted to do next.

00:19:37.449 --> 00:19:40.059
I went to a different university for my

00:19:40.059 --> 00:19:43.469
Master’s; I went to one called SOAS, which

00:19:43.469 --> 00:19:46.679
is a specialist university for Oriental

00:19:46.789 --> 00:19:49.149
and African studies, still in London.

00:19:50.259 --> 00:19:53.209
And in terms of my experience, it was

00:19:53.209 --> 00:19:55.589
slightly different to undergraduate,

00:19:55.809 --> 00:19:58.259
in that the studying aspect was

00:19:58.259 --> 00:20:01.149
taken more seriously, but the overall

00:20:01.159 --> 00:20:03.769
format and style were similar.

00:20:05.069 --> 00:20:08.429
So, to wrap things up, I spent five

00:20:08.429 --> 00:20:10.799
years of my life at university, and

00:20:10.979 --> 00:20:13.089
enjoyed almost every minute of it.

00:20:13.929 --> 00:20:16.179
I was lucky enough to go to a very good

00:20:16.179 --> 00:20:19.219
university, one of those four in the UK

00:20:19.219 --> 00:20:21.519
that rank among the top 10 in the world.

00:20:22.419 --> 00:20:24.859
Of course, university isn’t the right

00:20:24.859 --> 00:20:27.299
choice for everyone, and many British

00:20:27.299 --> 00:20:29.839
universities rightly come under criticism

00:20:30.019 --> 00:20:32.099
for offering expensive degrees that

00:20:32.119 --> 00:20:33.959
don’t deliver good value for money.

00:20:34.969 --> 00:20:37.609
For me, it was a great choice, and

00:20:37.619 --> 00:20:40.439
one I would make again in a heartbeat.

00:20:41.699 --> 00:20:43.839
OK, then, that is it for today's

00:20:43.839 --> 00:20:45.799
episode on British Universities.

00:20:45.999 --> 00:20:47.229
I hope it's been an interesting one,

00:20:47.529 --> 00:20:49.229
no matter whether you are a budding

00:20:49.239 --> 00:20:51.519
17-year-old thinking about applying

00:20:51.519 --> 00:20:53.489
to a British university or you are

00:20:53.499 --> 00:20:55.839
77 years old and you can think of

00:20:55.839 --> 00:20:57.789
nothing worse than spending Fresher’s

00:20:57.809 --> 00:20:59.359
Week at a British university.

00:20:59.979 --> 00:21:02.059
If you are interested in learning more

00:21:02.069 --> 00:21:03.839
about British universities, we have

00:21:03.839 --> 00:21:05.309
a couple more episodes that might be

00:21:05.329 --> 00:21:08.749
interesting: episode number 276 is

00:21:08.749 --> 00:21:11.319
all about Oxbridge [that's Oxford and

00:21:11.339 --> 00:21:15.289
Cambridge universities], and episode 513

00:21:15.599 --> 00:21:18.009
is all about the UK university crisis.

00:21:18.329 --> 00:21:19.609
I’ll put a link to both of

00:21:19.649 --> 00:21:20.939
those in the description.

00:21:21.539 --> 00:21:23.179
And as a quick reminder, this

00:21:23.179 --> 00:21:25.159
was part two of our three-part

00:21:25.159 --> 00:21:27.609
mini-series on the theme of university.

00:21:27.999 --> 00:21:30.039
In case you missed part one, we talked

00:21:30.049 --> 00:21:31.859
about the history of university in

00:21:31.859 --> 00:21:34.799
general, and next up, it’ll be the sordid

00:21:34.859 --> 00:21:37.819
and scammy history of Trump University.

00:21:38.659 --> 00:21:40.539
You've been listening to English Learning

00:21:40.539 --> 00:21:43.109
for Curious Minds by Leonardo English.

00:21:43.529 --> 00:21:46.349
I'm Alastair Budge, you stay safe, and

00:21:46.349 --> 00:21:48.709
I'll catch you in the next episode.
