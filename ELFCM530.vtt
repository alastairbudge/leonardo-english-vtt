Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.885 --> 00:00:16.075
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories and learn weird and

00:00:16.095 --> 00:00:20.265
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.855 --> 00:00:25.655
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is the start of another three-part

00:00:25.675 --> 00:00:29.865
mini-series, which I am giving the name of Putin and Poison.

00:00:30.675 --> 00:00:34.975
In part one, this episode, we are going to look at the the life of Vladimir

00:00:34.975 --> 00:00:40.825
Putin, learn about his early life and rise to power, and find out how he went

00:00:40.835 --> 00:00:45.955
from a small, rat-infested apartment in St Petersburg to the heart of the Kremlin.

00:00:46.715 --> 00:00:52.195
In part two, we are going to look at a very specific event in the life of Vladimir Putin,

00:00:52.585 --> 00:00:58.685
the murder by poison of his former colleague and then critic, Alexander Litvinenko.

00:00:59.255 --> 00:01:04.375
And in part three, we are going to look at the tragicomic time that two

00:01:04.385 --> 00:01:09.025
Russian agents travelled to the sleepy town of Salisbury, in England,

00:01:09.245 --> 00:01:13.735
in a failed attempt to poison a double agent called Sergey Skripal.

00:01:14.607 --> 00:01:19.904
OK then, let’s get started and learn about the life of Vladimir Putin.

00:01:22.387 --> 00:01:28.077
The siege of Leningrad was one of the most brutal events of World War Two.

00:01:29.107 --> 00:01:38.257
From the 8th of September 1941 to the 27th of January 1944, the Russian city now known as St

00:01:38.257 --> 00:01:44.727
Petersburg was surrounded by German forces, with Finnish troops occupying positions to the north.

00:01:45.957 --> 00:01:54.217
This siege involved 872 days of non-stop artillery and bombing raids in an attempt

00:01:54.277 --> 00:02:00.347
to annihilate, to completely destroy, the city and its 3 million residents.

00:02:01.467 --> 00:02:06.927
Alongside this, the winter of 1941 was brutally cold.

00:02:07.667 --> 00:02:11.247
Temperatures dropped to minus 40 degrees Celsius.

00:02:12.007 --> 00:02:15.667
Residents were forced to burn books to keep warm.

00:02:16.537 --> 00:02:21.397
Dogs, cats and rats were killed to supplement the miserable

00:02:21.621 --> 00:02:26.127
125 grammes of bread a day that each resident was allocated.

00:02:27.467 --> 00:02:37.047
An estimated 1.5 million people died, but most not from German bombs or bullets but from starvation.

00:02:37.987 --> 00:02:42.757
Early 1942 was particularly brutal, with an estimated

00:02:42.767 --> 00:02:46.477
100,000 people dying from starvation every month.

00:02:48.087 --> 00:02:54.067
To put it another way, that’s one person dying from starvation every 25 seconds.

00:02:55.617 --> 00:02:59.507
Two people who were lucky enough not to perish were

00:02:59.517 --> 00:03:04.287
Vladimir Spiridonovich Putin and Maria Ivanovna Putina.

00:03:05.467 --> 00:03:10.227
Eight years after the end of the war, in 1952, they had a son.

00:03:11.387 --> 00:03:13.657
It was somewhat unexpected.

00:03:14.457 --> 00:03:21.497
Maria was 41, as was Vladimir, and they had already had two sons, both of whom

00:03:21.617 --> 00:03:27.157
had died: the first as an infant and the second in the siege of Leningrad.

00:03:28.567 --> 00:03:35.872
This son’s name, the boy born on October 7th, 1952, was, of course, Vladimir Putin.

00:03:37.162 --> 00:03:42.472
There are very few records of the early life of Vladimir Putin, few pictures

00:03:42.472 --> 00:03:48.232
or official documents, and what we know comes mainly from the man himself.

00:03:49.272 --> 00:03:53.812
This has led to some conspiracies, including that he was actually

00:03:53.852 --> 00:03:58.002
born in the Ural Mountains to a different mother, but these don’t have

00:03:58.002 --> 00:04:01.612
enough evidence for us to warrant giving them any more time than this.

00:04:02.952 --> 00:04:07.672
Putin grew up in what we would now describe as extreme poverty:

00:04:08.102 --> 00:04:11.732
living in a communal apartment without heating or its own toilet.

00:04:12.632 --> 00:04:16.282
By his own admission, he was a street kid, living on the

00:04:16.282 --> 00:04:19.892
streets, learning how to fight and stand up for himself.

00:04:20.952 --> 00:04:25.532
Indeed, one of his favourite anecdotes from this time is a story

00:04:25.532 --> 00:04:28.982
about chasing the rats that infested his apartment building.

00:04:30.082 --> 00:04:34.782
To quote Putin directly, 'There, on that stair landing, I got a

00:04:34.812 --> 00:04:38.942
quick and lasting lesson in the meaning of the word "cornered".

00:04:39.392 --> 00:04:42.182
There were hordes of rats in the front entryway.

00:04:42.662 --> 00:04:45.682
My friends and I used to chase them around with sticks.

00:04:46.432 --> 00:04:52.882
Once I spotted a huge rat and pursued it down the hall until I drove it into a corner.

00:04:53.502 --> 00:04:54.692
It had nowhere to run.

00:04:55.712 --> 00:04:59.102
Suddenly it lashed out and threw itself at me.

00:05:00.002 --> 00:05:02.172
I was surprised and frightened.

00:05:02.752 --> 00:05:04.772
Now the rat was chasing me.

00:05:05.522 --> 00:05:08.182
It jumped across the landing and down the stairs.

00:05:08.672 --> 00:05:13.832
Luckily, I was a little faster and I managed to slam the door on its nose.'

00:05:15.082 --> 00:05:18.832
He tells this story a lot, so he obviously likes it.

00:05:19.622 --> 00:05:25.562
Firstly, it reminds the listener of his upbringing as a regular, working-class Russian.

00:05:26.042 --> 00:05:30.692
He is like you, he understands the plight of the average Russian

00:05:30.812 --> 00:05:35.352
because he is one, or perhaps more accurately, he was one.

00:05:36.452 --> 00:05:42.432
Secondly, it brings to mind the idea of him being a lifelong rat-crusher.

00:05:43.012 --> 00:05:47.842
He might have started chasing rats in a squalid Leningrad apartment

00:05:47.842 --> 00:05:52.702
block, but the “rats” have just changed into his political opponents.

00:05:54.032 --> 00:06:01.702
And finally, to his opponents, foreign and domestic, it warns them not to back him into a corner.

00:06:02.372 --> 00:06:06.552
Like the rat, if he has no option to escape, he will attack.

00:06:07.322 --> 00:06:11.682
Or at least, according to many Western commentators, that’s what he wants them to think.

00:06:12.722 --> 00:06:18.122
He was, according to his official Kremlin biography, a troublemaker, uninterested

00:06:18.122 --> 00:06:22.882
in his studies and more interested in fighting and judo than homework.

00:06:23.692 --> 00:06:28.762
What he was interested in was the KGB, the Russian secret service.

00:06:29.502 --> 00:06:35.582
While he was still at high school he knocked on the door of the KGB offices and enquired about how

00:06:35.602 --> 00:06:42.202
to join, and was basically told to go away and come back once he had graduated from university.

00:06:43.292 --> 00:06:48.122
He studied law, which he was told gave him the best chance of being accepted

00:06:48.302 --> 00:06:55.156
to the KGB, and sure enough, after his graduation in 1975, he joined the KGB.

00:06:56.164 --> 00:07:03.232
Now, the nature of his work at the KGB is a closely guarded secret, but most

00:07:03.232 --> 00:07:08.292
biographies of Putin suggest that it was a lot less exciting than it might sound.

00:07:09.612 --> 00:07:13.832
He was based in Russia for the first 10 years and then

00:07:13.832 --> 00:07:19.586
was in Dresden, in then East Germany, from 1985 to 1990.

00:07:20.796 --> 00:07:24.916
And he wasn’t operating in the shadows, hiding in ditches

00:07:24.916 --> 00:07:28.186
or secretly breaking into apartments to gain intelligence.

00:07:29.196 --> 00:07:35.436
According to a 2012 biography by the Russian-American journalist Masha Gessen, and I’m

00:07:35.436 --> 00:07:40.566
quoting directly, 'Putin and his colleagues were reduced mainly to collecting press

00:07:40.566 --> 00:07:46.886
clippings, thus contributing to the mountains of useless information produced by the KGB.'

00:07:48.366 --> 00:07:51.016
In other words, he was pushing paper around.

00:07:51.456 --> 00:07:57.646
It was a rather meaningless office job, but the mystique around it later allowed

00:07:57.646 --> 00:08:02.606
Putin to let people imagine that it might have been something much more important.

00:08:04.356 --> 00:08:10.476
Soon after the fall of the Berlin Wall, in 1989, he returned to Russia, before

00:08:10.496 --> 00:08:16.476
resigning from the KGB in 1991 and finding work in the St Petersburg local government.

00:08:17.576 --> 00:08:21.796
His first significant political role was as an aide to a

00:08:21.796 --> 00:08:25.876
charismatic man called Anatoly Sobchak, the mayor of St.

00:08:25.876 --> 00:08:28.306
Petersburg and a former law professor.

00:08:29.272 --> 00:08:34.776
Putin worked as Sobchak’s right-hand man, officially in charge of foreign relations.

00:08:36.226 --> 00:08:41.056
This job involved attracting international business to the city, something that was

00:08:41.066 --> 00:08:45.976
desperately needed as Russia transitioned from communism to a capitalist economy.

00:08:47.346 --> 00:08:53.006
He got a name for himself as being an effective bag-carrier; someone who was

00:08:53.016 --> 00:08:58.536
reliable, would always do the work, was a safe, unthreatening pair of hands.

00:08:59.626 --> 00:09:05.296
But in reality, this job gave Putin access to two things that

00:09:05.296 --> 00:09:10.486
would become central to his later career: connections and control.

00:09:11.736 --> 00:09:14.946
Connections with powerful businesspeople, government

00:09:14.946 --> 00:09:18.796
officials, and, some would argue, criminal organisations.

00:09:19.736 --> 00:09:24.616
And control over who got what and under what terms.

00:09:26.216 --> 00:09:30.966
It was also during this time that allegations of corruption began to follow him.

00:09:32.166 --> 00:09:37.164
A 1992 investigation accused Putin of allowing raw materials—like

00:09:37.354 --> 00:09:42.584
metals—to be sold abroad in exchange for food imports that never arrived.

00:09:43.284 --> 00:09:48.374
The amount of money involved was significant, and it painted an early

00:09:48.374 --> 00:09:52.714
picture of a man willing to bend the rules for those in his circle.

00:09:53.944 --> 00:09:56.354
However, none of this damaged his career.

00:09:57.024 --> 00:10:02.284
Sobchak was loyal to Putin, and in Russian politics, like in many

00:10:02.284 --> 00:10:06.984
countries, unfortunately, loyalty is often more important than integrity.

00:10:08.334 --> 00:10:10.524
This loyalty went both ways.

00:10:10.984 --> 00:10:16.484
When Sobchak lost his position as mayor in 1996, Putin stuck with him.

00:10:17.294 --> 00:10:21.644
He even helped him flee to Paris when Sobchak faced corruption charges.

00:10:22.494 --> 00:10:26.434
Putin, it seemed, was a man who understood the importance of

00:10:26.434 --> 00:10:30.084
doing favours—and collecting them when the time was right.

00:10:31.614 --> 00:10:38.244
In 1996, Vladimir Putin moved to Moscow, leaving behind his relatively modest role in St.

00:10:38.244 --> 00:10:38.904
Petersburg.

00:10:39.984 --> 00:10:45.124
And once in the capital, his career took off at lightning speed.

00:10:46.764 --> 00:10:50.744
He quickly gained a reputation for being loyal, reliable,

00:10:51.164 --> 00:10:55.584
and—importantly—unambitious in the eyes of those in power.

00:10:57.044 --> 00:11:02.404
This made him the perfect candidate for those looking to elevate someone they could control.

00:11:03.564 --> 00:11:11.651
In 1998, he was appointed head of the Federal Security Service, or FSB, the successor to the KGB.

00:11:12.707 --> 00:11:19.564
Just a year later, in 1999, Boris Yeltsin, Russia’s first president, made him prime minister.

00:11:20.984 --> 00:11:24.274
Putin’s appointment came at a chaotic time for Russia.

00:11:24.894 --> 00:11:27.654
The country was struggling economically, politically,

00:11:27.844 --> 00:11:30.584
and socially after the collapse of the Soviet Union.

00:11:31.824 --> 00:11:38.794
Boris Yeltsin himself was deeply unpopular, and his government was plagued by corruption scandals.

00:11:39.354 --> 00:11:44.064
He was also an awful drunk and was seen as a liability.

00:11:44.764 --> 00:11:49.664
The sober Putin, on the other hand, presented himself as a calm,

00:11:49.934 --> 00:11:54.404
no-nonsense figure—a man who could bring order to the chaos.

00:11:55.424 --> 00:12:00.804
His first major test came in 1999, during the Second Chechen War.

00:12:02.005 --> 00:12:05.566
A series of apartment bombings in Russia killed over

00:12:05.566 --> 00:12:10.406
300 people, and the government blamed Chechen rebels.

00:12:11.806 --> 00:12:15.086
Putin’s response was swift and brutal.

00:12:16.406 --> 00:12:19.836
He promised to hunt down the perpetrators, famously

00:12:19.836 --> 00:12:22.916
declaring, “We will pursue terrorists everywhere.

00:12:23.236 --> 00:12:26.226
If we catch them in the toilet, we’ll drown them there.”

00:12:27.626 --> 00:12:32.966
This tough rhetoric and his decisive actions won him widespread support.

00:12:33.956 --> 00:12:39.026
To many Russians, especially compared to the permanently drunk and unreliable

00:12:39.026 --> 00:12:44.016
Yeltsin, he seemed like the strong leader the country desperately needed.

00:12:45.276 --> 00:12:51.446
Then, on New Year’s Eve 1999, Boris Yeltsin resigned as president.

00:12:52.666 --> 00:12:58.676
In a surprising and dramatic announcement, in which he talked about the need for Russia to move

00:12:58.906 --> 00:13:05.336
into the new millennium with new leaders, he handed power to Putin, who became acting president.

00:13:06.927 --> 00:13:13.896
At that moment, Vladimir Putin, a man who had risen from obscurity, and was partly given

00:13:13.936 --> 00:13:19.216
positions of power because he was thought not to want it, was now the leader of Russia.

00:13:20.926 --> 00:13:26.336
Just a few months later, in March of 2000, and in no small part thanks to his

00:13:26.366 --> 00:13:30.826
perception as being someone who could effectively deal with Chechnya, he won

00:13:30.836 --> 00:13:35.066
the Presidential election, becoming the duly elected leader of the country.

00:13:35.966 --> 00:13:41.396
When Putin officially became president in 2000, Russia was in disarray.

00:13:41.776 --> 00:13:47.196
The economy had collapsed following the financial crisis of 1998, oligarchs were

00:13:47.196 --> 00:13:51.906
running the country, and there was widespread disillusionment with the government.

00:13:53.019 --> 00:13:56.106
Putin quickly moved to restore order.

00:13:57.106 --> 00:14:01.526
One of his first targets was the oligarchs—Russia’s super-rich

00:14:01.556 --> 00:14:05.766
businesspeople who had amassed enormous wealth during the 1990s.

00:14:07.086 --> 00:14:11.406
Some oligarchs, like Roman Abramovich, struck deals with Putin,

00:14:11.846 --> 00:14:15.296
pledging their loyalty in exchange for keeping their fortunes.

00:14:16.836 --> 00:14:20.726
Others, like Mikhail Khodorkovsky, were less fortunate.

00:14:21.716 --> 00:14:26.806
Khodorkovsky, once the richest man in Russia, was arrested and subjected

00:14:26.996 --> 00:14:32.616
to a show trial, where this billionaire was placed in a cage in court.

00:14:33.556 --> 00:14:39.886
Unsurprisingly, he was found guilty, imprisoned, and his company taken over by the state.

00:14:40.876 --> 00:14:45.996
This sent a clear message: in Putin’s Russia, no one was

00:14:45.996 --> 00:14:49.775
above the law—unless, of course, you were loyal to Putin.

00:14:50.382 --> 00:14:54.576
At the same time, Putin worked to consolidate political power.

00:14:55.336 --> 00:15:01.916
Independent media outlets were shut down or taken over by state-run companies, political opponents

00:15:02.086 --> 00:15:09.376
were sidelined or had unfortunate tumbles out of fourth-floor windows, and protests were suppressed.

00:15:10.876 --> 00:15:14.906
But while critics both at home and abroad accused

00:15:14.926 --> 00:15:18.546
him of authoritarianism, many Russians supported him.

00:15:19.926 --> 00:15:25.366
Putin’s first term as President coincided with a boom in oil prices, which was

00:15:25.366 --> 00:15:29.706
very good news for a country where oil and gas make up a fifth of the economy.

00:15:30.526 --> 00:15:36.526
Under Putin, the economy stabilised, and living standards improved, at least in the early years.

00:15:37.246 --> 00:15:42.456
He positioned himself as the man who had restored Russia’s pride and power.

00:15:43.546 --> 00:15:48.936
He also cultivated a very specific image of himself: the fearless leader.

00:15:49.736 --> 00:15:56.706
He was photographed riding horses shirtless, diving into icy waters, and piloting fighter jets.

00:15:57.726 --> 00:16:02.296
This was especially the case during his brief hiatus from the Presidency,

00:16:02.616 --> 00:16:07.566
when after serving for two terms, he stepped down as President, as required

00:16:07.576 --> 00:16:12.376
by the Russian constitution, and his ally, Dmitry Medvedev, became President.

00:16:13.586 --> 00:16:20.426
As you may remember, this was in 2008, and at the time, there was reportedly a popular joke

00:16:20.446 --> 00:16:26.206
being told by Russians that gives you some indication of who people thought was really in charge.

00:16:26.866 --> 00:16:29.226
And the joke goes something like this:

00:16:30.056 --> 00:16:34.435
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin gave Medvedev a car without a steering wheel.

00:16:35.425 --> 00:16:40.195
Medvedev gets into the car, then says “But where is the steering wheel?”

00:16:41.375 --> 00:16:43.107
“Don’t worry,” answers Putin.

00:16:43.545 --> 00:16:44.635
“I’ll be doing the driving.”

00:16:45.705 --> 00:16:51.095
After this brief 4-year period ostensibly not running the country, Putin was

00:16:51.095 --> 00:16:56.585
re-elected as President in 2012, and he has been running the country ever since.

00:16:57.445 --> 00:17:02.845
In 2020, he even pushed through a constitutional amendment meaning that,

00:17:03.275 --> 00:17:08.535
theoretically, at least, he could remain President until the year 2036.

00:17:09.445 --> 00:17:14.225
Now, in the incredibly unlikely case that you'd never heard of Vladimir

00:17:14.225 --> 00:17:18.155
Putin before this, you might have thought that he sounds like an

00:17:18.155 --> 00:17:22.665
effective, strong leader, and there’s not much more to it than that.

00:17:23.355 --> 00:17:27.615
But, of course, the path to get here, and what he has

00:17:27.615 --> 00:17:31.805
done to maintain his power, has come at a brutal cost.

00:17:33.345 --> 00:17:39.555
One of the most controversial moments early in his rise to power came in 1999, during

00:17:39.555 --> 00:17:44.645
the wave of apartment bombings that killed over 300 people in cities across Russia.

00:17:45.535 --> 00:17:50.125
These bombings, which the government blamed on Chechen rebels, provided

00:17:50.125 --> 00:17:54.485
the justification for Putin’s launch of the Second Chechen War, a

00:17:54.485 --> 00:17:59.135
brutal military campaign to bring the region back under Russian control.

00:18:00.285 --> 00:18:05.655
But suspicions have lingered that the bombings were not the work of Chechen

00:18:05.665 --> 00:18:11.605
terrorists but a false flag operation orchestrated by Russia’s own security

00:18:11.605 --> 00:18:16.765
services to justify the war and bolster Putin’s image as a strong leader.

00:18:17.825 --> 00:18:21.915
In other words, these bombings were not the work of Chechen terrorists

00:18:22.125 --> 00:18:27.695
but of the FSB, on Putin’s orders, and hundreds of innocent Russian

00:18:27.695 --> 00:18:32.615
citizens were murdered to provide justification for a war in Chechnya.

00:18:33.805 --> 00:18:41.355
On one occasion, for example, bombs were found under an apartment block, and FSB agents were

00:18:41.355 --> 00:18:47.255
seen placing them, but when pressed, the government said that it was simply a training exercise.

00:18:48.555 --> 00:18:55.445
Not everyone is convinced, and the Kremlin denies it vehemently, but the bombings remain

00:18:55.445 --> 00:19:01.845
a dark shadow over Putin’s rise to power, and the truth remains a subject of debate.

00:19:03.235 --> 00:19:07.885
The Second Chechen War that followed was marked by extreme brutality.

00:19:08.705 --> 00:19:14.145
The Russian military indiscriminately bombed Chechen cities, including Grozny, the capital,

00:19:14.435 --> 00:19:20.135
which was described by the United Nations as the most destroyed city on Earth at the time.

00:19:20.755 --> 00:19:25.155
Tens of thousands of civilians were killed, and reports of war

00:19:25.155 --> 00:19:30.045
crimes, including torture and summary executions, were widespread.

00:19:31.455 --> 00:19:37.615
This approach sent a clear message: dissent would not be tolerated, and no price

00:19:37.615 --> 00:19:43.195
was too high to maintain Russia’s territorial integrity and Putin’s grip on power.

00:19:44.495 --> 00:19:49.055
And for anybody who did violate this message, anyone who stood against him,

00:19:49.295 --> 00:19:53.125
there were no lengths that Putin was not willing to go to to silence them.

00:19:53.799 --> 00:19:57.846
You could run, you could hide, but eventually, Putin would get you.

00:19:59.286 --> 00:20:02.196
One of his weapons of choice, at least to knock off

00:20:02.216 --> 00:20:06.516
individuals, is the theme of the next two episodes: poison.

00:20:07.876 --> 00:20:14.966
In 2006, a former FSB agent turned critic called Alexander Litvinenko made the mistake of

00:20:14.966 --> 00:20:20.466
going for tea with a couple of Russian agents in a five star hotel in Mayfair, in London.

00:20:21.316 --> 00:20:26.826
The green tea contained polonium-210, a radioactive element, and

00:20:27.096 --> 00:20:32.776
three weeks later, after a drawn out and very public decline, he died.

00:20:33.706 --> 00:20:40.976
Twelve years later, in 2018, Russian agents travelled to the UK again in an attempt to

00:20:41.006 --> 00:20:47.016
poison another former Russian agent, Sergey Skripal, but they failed in their attempt.

00:20:47.916 --> 00:20:53.036
We’ll cover these incidents in much greater detail in parts two and three of this mini-series,

00:20:53.346 --> 00:20:58.756
and they are only a couple in a long list of the use of poison under Vladimir Putin.

00:20:59.996 --> 00:21:04.186
These incidents not only silence critics but also serve

00:21:04.386 --> 00:21:09.166
as a warning to others: defy the Kremlin at your own risk.

00:21:10.346 --> 00:21:17.086
But perhaps the most chilling example of Putin’s ruthlessness has been his invasion of Ukraine.

00:21:17.916 --> 00:21:22.416
In 2014, Russia annexed Crimea, a move that shocked

00:21:22.436 --> 00:21:25.936
the world and drew condemnation from Western nations.

00:21:26.846 --> 00:21:33.856
Then, in February 2022, Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, bizarrely

00:21:34.096 --> 00:21:39.586
claiming it was to “denazify” the country and protect Russian-speaking populations.

00:21:40.626 --> 00:21:46.156
What followed, as you will know, was a brutal war that has displaced millions,

00:21:46.286 --> 00:21:52.236
caused tens of thousands of deaths, and left parts of Ukraine in ruins.

00:21:53.866 --> 00:21:58.246
The invasion, which was widely seen as an attempt to reassert Russia’s

00:21:58.256 --> 00:22:02.496
influence and challenge NATO’s expansion, has plunged relations

00:22:02.676 --> 00:22:06.966
between Russia and the West to their lowest point since the Cold War.

00:22:07.916 --> 00:22:12.646
And it has further isolated Russia economically and politically, raising

00:22:12.646 --> 00:22:16.956
questions about Putin’s long-term strategy and the future of his regime.

00:22:17.936 --> 00:22:23.626
But throughout all of this—wars, poisonings, and repression—Putin

00:22:23.896 --> 00:22:27.756
has shown an unrelenting commitment to holding onto power.

00:22:29.086 --> 00:22:32.846
For his supporters, these actions are the price of

00:22:32.846 --> 00:22:36.786
protecting Russia’s sovereignty and status as a global power.

00:22:37.816 --> 00:22:41.346
For his critics, they are the hallmarks of a man willing

00:22:41.346 --> 00:22:45.366
to destroy anyone or anything that stands in his way.

00:22:46.856 --> 00:22:52.516
As of the start of 2025, Vladimir Putin has been in power for 25

00:22:52.526 --> 00:22:56.926
years, longer than many of the tsars who ruled Russia before him.

00:22:57.786 --> 00:23:01.726
His life, from the streets of Leningrad to the Kremlin, is

00:23:01.726 --> 00:23:06.824
a story of ambition, secrecy, and survival at all costs.

00:23:07.646 --> 00:23:12.196
But as Russia faces growing challenges at home and abroad,

00:23:12.526 --> 00:23:15.666
questions are emerging about how long this can continue.

00:23:16.556 --> 00:23:21.266
Will Putin’s legacy be that of a man who restored Russia’s pride and power?

00:23:21.916 --> 00:23:27.916
Or will he be remembered as the leader who isolated his country and left it in ruins?

00:23:29.457 --> 00:23:34.667
To wrap things up, Vladimir Putin has shaped modern Russia in his image.

00:23:35.227 --> 00:23:41.667
He is 72 years old, shows no signs of relinquishing power, and if he rules for

00:23:41.667 --> 00:23:47.247
another 5 years, he will eclipse Josef Stalin as Russia’s longest-serving leader.

00:23:48.427 --> 00:23:56.087
One thing seems clear: for better or for worse, the story of Vladimir Putin is far from over.

00:23:59.117 --> 00:24:03.517
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Vladimir Putin.

00:24:04.037 --> 00:24:08.127
To state the obvious, we have only scratched the surface on the life of

00:24:08.127 --> 00:24:12.317
this man; hundreds of thousands of pages have been written, and I hope you

00:24:12.317 --> 00:24:16.707
will forgive me for skimming over many important and fascinating elements.

00:24:17.237 --> 00:24:24.357
As a reminder, this is part one of a three part mini-series on Putin and Poison, and in parts two

00:24:24.357 --> 00:24:30.257
and three we are going to go a lot deeper into two different but closely related incidents widely

00:24:30.257 --> 00:24:36.727
believed to be ordered by Vladimir Putin himself: the poisoning of one of his fiercest critics,

00:24:37.067 --> 00:24:42.947
Alexander Litvinenko, and the failed murder attempt on a former double agent, Sergey Skripal.

00:24:43.537 --> 00:24:48.097
