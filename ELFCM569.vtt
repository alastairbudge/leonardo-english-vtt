Hello, hello, hello, and welcome

00:00:07.765 --> 00:00:09.695
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.695 --> 00:00:12.485
Minds, by Leonardo English, the show

00:00:12.495 --> 00:00:14.185
where you can listen to fascinating

00:00:14.185 --> 00:00:16.665
stories and learn weird and wonderful

00:00:16.675 --> 00:00:18.765
things about the world at the same

00:00:18.765 --> 00:00:20.595
time as improving your English.

00:00:21.215 --> 00:00:23.515
I'm Alastair Budge, and today

00:00:23.675 --> 00:00:25.755
it’s part three of our mini-series

00:00:25.955 --> 00:00:27.935
on “Young American Outlaws”.

00:00:28.365 --> 00:00:30.285
In part one, we learned about the

00:00:30.285 --> 00:00:32.895
story of Ross Ulbricht, the founder

00:00:32.915 --> 00:00:35.615
of the drug marketplace Silk Road.

00:00:36.375 --> 00:00:39.105
In part two, we heard about the brilliant

00:00:39.135 --> 00:00:41.475
but tragically short life of Aaron

00:00:41.475 --> 00:00:43.905
Swartz, the young man who believed so

00:00:43.905 --> 00:00:46.345
much in internet freedom that he found

00:00:46.345 --> 00:00:48.815
himself up against the US government.

00:00:49.595 --> 00:00:51.825
And in today’s episode, part three,

00:00:52.075 --> 00:00:54.340
we are going to be talking about Luigi

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.845
Mangione, the man who gunned down

00:00:56.855 --> 00:00:59.425
the CEO of one of America’s largest

00:00:59.455 --> 00:01:02.165
healthcare companies in broad daylight.

00:01:02.755 --> 00:01:05.091
So, let’s not waste a minute

00:01:05.365 --> 00:01:06.745
and get right into it.

00:01:08.815 --> 00:01:10.815
The two previous characters in this

00:01:10.815 --> 00:01:13.775
mini-series, Ross Ulbricht and Aaron

00:01:13.785 --> 00:01:16.725
Swartz, might have committed acts the US

00:01:16.745 --> 00:01:19.365
government considered “felonies”–serious

00:01:19.365 --> 00:01:21.985
crimes–but they never picked up a

00:01:21.985 --> 00:01:24.805
weapon and harmed anyone directly.

00:01:25.655 --> 00:01:28.235
In Ross Ulbricht’s case, his critics

00:01:28.235 --> 00:01:30.695
might say that his drug and contraband

00:01:30.705 --> 00:01:34.345
marketplace indirectly harmed and killed

00:01:34.355 --> 00:01:36.645
thousands, tens of thousands even.

00:01:37.915 --> 00:01:40.925
And in Aaron Swartz’s case, even his

00:01:40.935 --> 00:01:43.835
greatest critics would surely agree that

00:01:43.835 --> 00:01:46.655
the most significant “harm” caused was the

00:01:46.655 --> 00:01:49.625
potential loss of some corporate revenue

00:01:49.935 --> 00:01:52.725
and damage to the concept of copyright.

00:01:53.725 --> 00:01:56.845
And Aaron Swartz, were he still alive

00:01:56.845 --> 00:02:00.425
today, would justifiably question why he

00:02:00.425 --> 00:02:02.945
was mentioned even in the same sentence

00:02:03.215 --> 00:02:05.275
as the subject of today’s episode.

00:02:06.894 --> 00:02:08.875
Luigi Mangione, as you will

00:02:08.885 --> 00:02:10.895
probably remember, murdered

00:02:10.935 --> 00:02:12.955
a man in broad daylight.

00:02:13.965 --> 00:02:15.905
Or to be completely correct,

00:02:16.275 --> 00:02:17.575
as of the time of recording,

00:02:17.865 --> 00:02:20.705
stands accused of murder, as the

00:02:20.705 --> 00:02:22.635
case has not yet gone to trial.

00:02:23.705 --> 00:02:25.585
So here’s what happened,

00:02:25.915 --> 00:02:27.725
as far as we know so far.

00:02:29.195 --> 00:02:32.615
On the morning of December 4th, 2024,

00:02:33.055 --> 00:02:35.815
the CEO of the American health insurance

00:02:35.815 --> 00:02:38.555
company, UnitedHealthcare, was in New

00:02:38.555 --> 00:02:41.035
York City for an investor conference.

00:02:41.915 --> 00:02:43.295
It was nothing out of the

00:02:43.295 --> 00:02:45.215
ordinary for Brian Thompson.

00:02:46.065 --> 00:02:48.455
The 50-year-old boss of America’s

00:02:48.485 --> 00:02:50.285
largest health insurance company

00:02:50.575 --> 00:02:53.065
travelled a lot, and Wall Street

00:02:53.205 --> 00:02:54.925
was a regular haunt for him.

00:02:56.235 --> 00:02:59.125
After all, this was a company valued

00:02:59.155 --> 00:03:02.825
at almost $500 billion, one that

00:03:02.825 --> 00:03:04.885
provides medical insurance for 50

00:03:04.885 --> 00:03:08.165
million people, or 1 in 6 Americans.

00:03:09.375 --> 00:03:13.355
At 6.40 am that morning, Thompson left

00:03:13.365 --> 00:03:15.805
the Marriott hotel he was staying at and

00:03:15.805 --> 00:03:18.275
made the short walk to the hotel where

00:03:18.275 --> 00:03:20.225
the conference would be taking place.

00:03:21.585 --> 00:03:23.925
Presumably, Thompson thought it

00:03:23.925 --> 00:03:26.035
would be a day like any other.

00:03:26.865 --> 00:03:29.325
Perhaps a few tough questions from

00:03:29.325 --> 00:03:31.895
investors, reassurances that the company

00:03:31.895 --> 00:03:33.265
was going in the right direction,

00:03:33.695 --> 00:03:36.515
reminders of how the share price and

00:03:36.525 --> 00:03:38.445
the company’s profits had increased

00:03:38.445 --> 00:03:41.375
by 50% since Thompson had taken over

00:03:41.615 --> 00:03:44.385
three years earlier, and how his $10

00:03:44.385 --> 00:03:47.175
million a year compensation package was

00:03:47.175 --> 00:03:49.563
therefore a small price to pay, and how

00:03:49.563 --> 00:03:51.435
UnitedHealthcare was delivering excellent

00:03:51.435 --> 00:03:54.125
service and value for the American people.

00:03:55.505 --> 00:03:58.415
The day didn’t pan out like that.

00:03:59.925 --> 00:04:02.045
Four minutes after leaving his

00:04:02.045 --> 00:04:06.715
hotel, at 06.44 he was shot multiple

00:04:06.715 --> 00:04:09.765
times, in the back and the leg.

00:04:10.955 --> 00:04:13.535
Minutes later, the emergency services

00:04:13.575 --> 00:04:15.765
arrived on the scene to find this

00:04:15.805 --> 00:04:18.535
corporate titan in a pool of blood.

00:04:19.705 --> 00:04:22.765
He was whisked to hospital, but pronounced

00:04:22.765 --> 00:04:25.085
dead less than half an hour later.

00:04:26.526 --> 00:04:30.186
To state the obvious, this was huge news.

00:04:31.156 --> 00:04:33.146
He might not have been a household

00:04:33.146 --> 00:04:36.466
name, in the category of Elon Musk

00:04:36.466 --> 00:04:39.516
or Bill Gates, but this was the boss

00:04:39.696 --> 00:04:41.556
of one of the biggest companies, not

00:04:41.596 --> 00:04:44.416
just in America, but the whole world.

00:04:45.826 --> 00:04:48.916
There seemed to be no personal motive;

00:04:49.516 --> 00:04:51.386
Thompson had worked in corporate

00:04:51.426 --> 00:04:54.176
America his entire life, he hadn’t

00:04:54.176 --> 00:04:57.256
got tangled up in organised crime or

00:04:57.486 --> 00:04:59.646
got involved in any kind of serious

00:04:59.756 --> 00:05:02.156
personal dispute, he was praised by

00:05:02.156 --> 00:05:05.526
colleagues as a “good, honest man”.

00:05:07.076 --> 00:05:08.846
The evidence at the crime scene,

00:05:09.166 --> 00:05:11.346
however, suggested a motive.

00:05:12.786 --> 00:05:16.876
The words "deny," "defend" and "depose"

00:05:17.046 --> 00:05:19.196
were found scrawled on three of the

00:05:19.196 --> 00:05:22.206
used bullet casings, one word on each.

00:05:23.536 --> 00:05:26.446
This seemed eerily similar to a phrase

00:05:26.516 --> 00:05:28.536
often associated with the health

00:05:28.566 --> 00:05:30.816
insurance industry to avoid paying

00:05:30.826 --> 00:05:34.696
claims, “delay, deny, and defend”.

00:05:35.806 --> 00:05:38.246
“Delay” refers to how companies

00:05:38.256 --> 00:05:41.066
drag out the claim process, “deny”

00:05:41.296 --> 00:05:44.006
means rejecting claims outright, and

00:05:44.246 --> 00:05:46.926
“defend” means engaging in extended

00:05:46.946 --> 00:05:48.806
legal battles with the claimant.

00:05:50.186 --> 00:05:52.836
Suddenly, it seemed like the assassin’s

00:05:52.846 --> 00:05:55.926
target wasn’t Brian Thompson the

00:05:55.926 --> 00:05:58.736
man, but rather Brian Thompson the

00:05:58.736 --> 00:06:01.826
CEO, Brian Thompson as a symbol

00:06:01.976 --> 00:06:03.776
of the health insurance industry.

00:06:05.143 --> 00:06:06.563
Fortunately for the police,

00:06:06.923 --> 00:06:09.313
the entire thing, this daylight

00:06:09.363 --> 00:06:12.436
murder, had been caught on CCTV.

00:06:14.033 --> 00:06:16.903
A huge manhunt ensued, with the New

00:06:16.903 --> 00:06:19.053
York City police department offering

00:06:19.063 --> 00:06:22.433
a reward of $10,000 for information

00:06:22.433 --> 00:06:24.533
about the shooter, a reward that

00:06:24.533 --> 00:06:27.953
was then upped to $50,000 when the

00:06:27.953 --> 00:06:30.153
FBI joined in the investigation.

00:06:31.693 --> 00:06:33.853
As you may well remember, as it all

00:06:33.853 --> 00:06:36.403
happened less than a year ago, photos

00:06:36.523 --> 00:06:39.203
started to emerge of the suspected killer.

00:06:40.153 --> 00:06:42.893
He was tall, white, and young,

00:06:43.163 --> 00:06:44.913
with a pearly white smile.

00:06:46.293 --> 00:06:48.493
He seemed to be pretty aware of the

00:06:48.493 --> 00:06:51.813
presence of CCTV cameras, and always

00:06:51.993 --> 00:06:55.083
covered his face and had his hood up, but

00:06:55.443 --> 00:06:58.183
he let down his guard a couple of times,

00:06:58.453 --> 00:07:01.493
once lowering his mask to flirt with a

00:07:01.493 --> 00:07:03.863
receptionist at a New York City hostel.

00:07:05.123 --> 00:07:06.873
A couple of days later, a

00:07:06.883 --> 00:07:09.143
backpack was recovered in Central

00:07:09.143 --> 00:07:11.163
Park, containing Monopoly money

00:07:11.423 --> 00:07:12.903
and a Tommy Hilfiger jacket.

00:07:14.123 --> 00:07:17.063
But still, no sign of the suspect.

00:07:18.403 --> 00:07:21.963
A few days later, on December 9th, five

00:07:21.963 --> 00:07:24.483
days after Brian Thompson was pronounced

00:07:24.483 --> 00:07:27.503
dead, Pennsylvania police received

00:07:27.503 --> 00:07:30.113
a call from a McDonald’s employee.

00:07:31.413 --> 00:07:33.243
There was someone sitting in the

00:07:33.243 --> 00:07:35.413
restaurant who bore a striking

00:07:35.433 --> 00:07:37.353
resemblance to the pictures of

00:07:37.353 --> 00:07:38.923
the suspect in the shooting.

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:41.850
The police arrived on the

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:44.120
scene and detained the man.

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:48.360
He was searched, and on his person

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:51.190
were found a 3D-printed gun and

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:54.050
suppressor, similar to those suspected

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:55.720
of having been used in the shooting.

00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:58.990
They also found a fake driver’s

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:01.080
licence and a lengthy letter

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:04.230
criticising the US healthcare system.

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:08.650
It seemed police had found their man.

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:13.080
He was named as Luigi Mangione, and was

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:16.000
a 26-year-old University of Pennsylvania

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:19.410
graduate with no prior criminal record.

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:23.320
In the letter, which was described

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.940
by many news outlets as a manifesto,

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:29.550
Mangione laid clear his motivations.

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:34.290
It was 262 words in total, so I won’t

00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:36.790
read all of it, but it was enough

00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:39.240
to ignite a political firestorm.

00:08:40.712 --> 00:08:44.782
In it, he wrote: “Frankly, these parasites

00:08:44.952 --> 00:08:48.742
simply had it coming.” He railed against

00:08:48.762 --> 00:08:51.192
America’s healthcare system, highlighting

00:08:51.192 --> 00:08:53.542
the absurdity of a country spending

00:08:53.542 --> 00:08:55.752
more on healthcare than anywhere else

00:08:55.962 --> 00:08:58.972
while ranking 42nd in life expectancy.

00:09:00.382 --> 00:09:04.112
In the letter–or manifesto–Mangione

00:09:04.462 --> 00:09:06.482
indirectly confessed to the killing,

00:09:06.852 --> 00:09:10.592
but showed no remorse, instead painting

00:09:10.592 --> 00:09:13.682
himself as a warrior for social justice.

00:09:15.282 --> 00:09:16.902
The Manhattan District Attorney

00:09:17.362 --> 00:09:19.932
didn’t see it that way, and Mangione

00:09:19.942 --> 00:09:22.162
was indicted with 11 different

00:09:22.162 --> 00:09:24.647
charges relating to the murder.

00:09:25.282 --> 00:09:30.372
This was on December 17th, 2024, and he

00:09:30.372 --> 00:09:33.242
has remained in police custody ever since.

00:09:34.582 --> 00:09:37.712
Now, on one level, this is a

00:09:37.732 --> 00:09:40.112
straightforward, clear-cut case.

00:09:40.752 --> 00:09:42.772
A man was murdered in

00:09:42.772 --> 00:09:44.352
cold blood by another.

00:09:45.182 --> 00:09:47.142
The accused has not denied it.

00:09:47.522 --> 00:09:50.582
Murder is a very serious crime, and

00:09:50.592 --> 00:09:52.852
Luigi Mangione will go to trial,

00:09:53.172 --> 00:09:55.962
most probably be found guilty, and be

00:09:55.982 --> 00:09:58.282
sentenced in accordance with the law.

00:09:59.182 --> 00:10:01.542
It’s a murder case, one of almost

00:10:01.542 --> 00:10:04.492
20,000 every year in the United States,

00:10:04.732 --> 00:10:07.622
and this seems relatively simple.

00:10:08.782 --> 00:10:10.902
But there are many aspects of

00:10:10.902 --> 00:10:13.172
this case that are unusual.

00:10:14.502 --> 00:10:16.712
Mangione was not a hardened criminal.

00:10:17.112 --> 00:10:19.242
He had no prior criminal convictions,

00:10:19.542 --> 00:10:21.742
was not known to the police, and

00:10:21.962 --> 00:10:24.542
his profile was far from typical

00:10:24.782 --> 00:10:27.012
for someone facing murder charges.

00:10:28.232 --> 00:10:29.792
He had gone to an expensive,

00:10:30.112 --> 00:10:31.852
private secondary school and

00:10:31.862 --> 00:10:34.282
graduated at the top of his class.

00:10:35.052 --> 00:10:36.972
He had studied computer engineering

00:10:37.252 --> 00:10:39.152
at the Ivy League University of

00:10:39.152 --> 00:10:41.412
Pennsylvania, one of the top universities

00:10:41.412 --> 00:10:43.812
in the country, and had had a few

00:10:43.992 --> 00:10:46.722
highly-paid jobs working in technology.

00:10:47.692 --> 00:10:50.502
He was young, tall, and handsome.

00:10:51.382 --> 00:10:54.182
He had suffered from some chronic back

00:10:54.202 --> 00:10:57.042
problems, so there was a personal reason

00:10:57.372 --> 00:10:59.542
for him to feel animosity towards the

00:10:59.542 --> 00:11:02.142
healthcare system, but it was nothing

00:11:02.302 --> 00:11:04.362
particularly out of the ordinary.

00:11:05.892 --> 00:11:08.612
And as more details emerged about

00:11:08.612 --> 00:11:11.272
Mangione, his manifesto, and the

00:11:11.272 --> 00:11:14.642
crime, instead of criticism, there

00:11:14.642 --> 00:11:17.332
were widespread social media posts in

00:11:17.332 --> 00:11:20.332
support, portraying him as a sort of

00:11:20.482 --> 00:11:23.902
21st-century folk hero, a figure willing

00:11:23.902 --> 00:11:26.952
to stand up against an unjust system.

00:11:28.342 --> 00:11:31.732
The hashtag #FreeLuigi started to trend;

00:11:31.822 --> 00:11:34.312
you could buy t-shirts and mugs with his

00:11:34.312 --> 00:11:37.316
face on, in a sort of Che Guevara style.

00:11:38.796 --> 00:11:40.676
The McDonald’s employee who called

00:11:40.676 --> 00:11:42.186
the police after recognising him

00:11:42.576 --> 00:11:45.106
received death threats, and the

00:11:45.116 --> 00:11:46.676
branch of McDonald’s where he

00:11:46.676 --> 00:11:48.736
was apprehended by police was

00:11:48.806 --> 00:11:51.106
inundated with negative reviews.

00:11:52.146 --> 00:11:55.326
So why did this case capture such a

00:11:55.326 --> 00:11:57.696
strange kind of public imagination?

00:11:58.486 --> 00:12:00.426
Well, part of the answer

00:12:00.786 --> 00:12:02.116
lies in the target.

00:12:03.606 --> 00:12:05.456
Brian Thompson might not have

00:12:05.456 --> 00:12:07.946
known Luigi Mangione, but he

00:12:07.946 --> 00:12:10.136
wasn’t some random passer-by.

00:12:10.506 --> 00:12:12.086
He wasn’t an unlucky

00:12:12.116 --> 00:12:13.486
victim of circumstance.

00:12:14.066 --> 00:12:16.246
He was the very visible head of

00:12:16.246 --> 00:12:17.956
the most powerful health insurance

00:12:17.976 --> 00:12:20.156
company in America, the face of

00:12:20.156 --> 00:12:21.846
an industry that is one of the

00:12:21.846 --> 00:12:23.926
most controversial in the country.

00:12:25.426 --> 00:12:27.446
As I’m sure you know, healthcare

00:12:27.446 --> 00:12:29.316
in the United States has long

00:12:29.326 --> 00:12:31.106
been a political battleground.

00:12:32.156 --> 00:12:34.216
Medical bills are the leading

00:12:34.216 --> 00:12:36.526
cause of personal bankruptcy.

00:12:37.136 --> 00:12:39.356
Stories of patients being denied

00:12:39.366 --> 00:12:42.076
life-saving treatment because of insurance

00:12:42.096 --> 00:12:44.346
loopholes are depressingly common.

00:12:45.536 --> 00:12:48.136
And around 30 million Americans

00:12:48.376 --> 00:12:50.666
have no health insurance at all.

00:12:52.086 --> 00:12:54.706
So when Luigi Mangione’s letter was

00:12:54.706 --> 00:12:57.384
published, when people saw the words

00:12:57.384 --> 00:12:59.866
he had scrawled on those bullet casings

00:12:59.866 --> 00:13:02.466
and read his note, his manifesto,

00:13:03.056 --> 00:13:05.946
for some the narrative shifted.

00:13:07.256 --> 00:13:09.216
It wasn’t simply a story about

00:13:09.236 --> 00:13:11.456
a young man accused of murder.

00:13:11.926 --> 00:13:14.046
It was presented as an act of

00:13:14.046 --> 00:13:16.106
rebellion against a system that

00:13:16.116 --> 00:13:18.476
millions believe to be broken.

00:13:19.726 --> 00:13:23.606
For some, Brian Thompson wasn’t an unlucky

00:13:23.626 --> 00:13:25.896
casualty; he was far from innocent.

00:13:26.706 --> 00:13:28.596
He was the boss of a company that

00:13:28.596 --> 00:13:30.606
made billions of dollars in profits

00:13:30.876 --> 00:13:32.986
by denying payouts to its customers,

00:13:33.466 --> 00:13:35.886
causing them anything from distress

00:13:35.906 --> 00:13:37.936
to bankruptcy to not being able

00:13:37.936 --> 00:13:39.756
to pay for life-saving treatment.

00:13:40.726 --> 00:13:43.056
He was the figurehead of an organisation

00:13:43.536 --> 00:13:45.346
that, to its biggest critics,

00:13:45.696 --> 00:13:48.426
directly resulted in the early deaths

00:13:48.546 --> 00:13:50.746
of thousands of people every year.

00:13:52.136 --> 00:13:55.366
Mangione needed to take drastic action

00:13:55.546 --> 00:13:58.196
for the country to wake up, and if a

00:13:58.206 --> 00:14:00.486
man needed to die for the insurance

00:14:00.516 --> 00:14:02.806
industry to be fixed, so be it.

00:14:04.056 --> 00:14:06.216
To Luigi Mangione’s most ardent

00:14:06.226 --> 00:14:08.796
supporters, Brian Thompson, and

00:14:09.046 --> 00:14:11.026
anyone presiding over this broken

00:14:11.026 --> 00:14:13.546
healthcare system, had it coming.

00:14:14.446 --> 00:14:16.266
Others, of course, saw

00:14:16.266 --> 00:14:17.436
it very differently.

00:14:18.286 --> 00:14:20.256
Whatever grievances Mangione may

00:14:20.256 --> 00:14:22.066
have had with the American healthcare

00:14:22.066 --> 00:14:23.886
system, he had still taken a

00:14:23.886 --> 00:14:26.336
gun and ended a stranger’s life.

00:14:27.386 --> 00:14:30.456
To his critics, he was no hero, just

00:14:30.476 --> 00:14:32.796
a murderer who tried to disguise

00:14:32.796 --> 00:14:34.916
his crime with political slogans.

00:14:36.209 --> 00:14:37.999
And interestingly enough,

00:14:38.289 --> 00:14:40.289
support for Mangione wasn’t as

00:14:40.329 --> 00:14:43.019
clear cut as right versus left.

00:14:44.359 --> 00:14:46.269
For starters, Mangione’s

00:14:46.369 --> 00:14:48.719
own politics were unclear.

00:14:49.559 --> 00:14:52.329
He was painted as an extreme leftist

00:14:52.559 --> 00:14:55.179
by the right-leaning press, but he

00:14:55.179 --> 00:14:58.579
expressed both praise and criticism for

00:14:58.579 --> 00:15:01.679
politicians on the left and right; he had

00:15:01.679 --> 00:15:05.429
no clear political ideology, other than

00:15:05.429 --> 00:15:07.969
a visceral hatred of corporate greed.

00:15:09.527 --> 00:15:11.697
And in terms of where support

00:15:11.697 --> 00:15:13.697
came from after his arrest,

00:15:14.017 --> 00:15:15.287
it wasn’t black and white.

00:15:16.287 --> 00:15:19.007
Those on the political left, especially

00:15:19.007 --> 00:15:21.687
on the extreme left, were more likely to

00:15:21.687 --> 00:15:24.567
side with him, but he also had support

00:15:24.587 --> 00:15:27.287
from some figures on the right, who railed

00:15:27.307 --> 00:15:29.437
against corporate greed and cronyism.

00:15:30.875 --> 00:15:33.895
And this support wasn’t a niche thing.

00:15:34.715 --> 00:15:37.225
According to one survey done shortly

00:15:37.265 --> 00:15:40.605
after his arrest, 47% of people

00:15:40.805 --> 00:15:44.035
identifying as “very liberal” reported

00:15:44.045 --> 00:15:46.515
having a favourable or extremely

00:15:46.545 --> 00:15:48.475
favourable opinion of Mangione.

00:15:49.805 --> 00:15:50.895
And it was a similar

00:15:50.895 --> 00:15:52.835
story when it came to age.

00:15:53.815 --> 00:15:56.005
Younger Americans were more likely

00:15:56.005 --> 00:15:59.285
to view him positively, with 39% of

00:15:59.365 --> 00:16:02.235
18-29-year-olds saying they viewed him

00:16:02.305 --> 00:16:04.425
either positively or very positively.

00:16:05.195 --> 00:16:07.845
32% of this age group said they

00:16:07.845 --> 00:16:10.945
didn’t know, and only 29% said

00:16:10.955 --> 00:16:12.615
they viewed him unfavourably.

00:16:13.765 --> 00:16:16.535
To repeat that, more young Americans

00:16:16.785 --> 00:16:19.675
viewed him favourably than unfavourably,

00:16:20.215 --> 00:16:23.245
and this was a man whose only public act,

00:16:23.675 --> 00:16:26.035
the only reason his name was known, was

00:16:26.035 --> 00:16:28.615
that he murdered a man in broad daylight.

00:16:30.032 --> 00:16:32.472
Naturally, as the public support,

00:16:32.652 --> 00:16:34.502
especially among younger Americans,

00:16:34.632 --> 00:16:36.702
was clear, the comments sections of

00:16:36.702 --> 00:16:39.012
newspapers were filled with opinion

00:16:39.012 --> 00:16:41.142
pieces about what went wrong.

00:16:41.762 --> 00:16:44.052
How did things get so bad?

00:16:44.582 --> 00:16:46.892
Is there such public distaste with

00:16:46.892 --> 00:16:48.932
corporate greed, especially among

00:16:48.932 --> 00:16:50.802
young people, that people believe

00:16:50.802 --> 00:16:53.142
such a drastic action is justified?

00:16:53.682 --> 00:16:55.862
Is the healthcare system so truly

00:16:55.872 --> 00:16:58.032
broken that murdering one of its

00:16:58.032 --> 00:17:01.392
executives is lauded as a public service?

00:17:03.042 --> 00:17:05.142
While all of this discussion was going

00:17:05.142 --> 00:17:07.802
on, there was also the question of what

00:17:07.852 --> 00:17:10.522
punishment should await Luigi Mangione?

00:17:11.842 --> 00:17:13.862
In the United States, as you may

00:17:13.862 --> 00:17:16.472
know, there are both state and

00:17:16.482 --> 00:17:19.192
federal crimes, so he could be charged

00:17:19.232 --> 00:17:21.545
under New York and federal law.

00:17:23.172 --> 00:17:25.382
The importance of this comes down to

00:17:25.382 --> 00:17:27.052
the question of the death penalty.

00:17:28.492 --> 00:17:31.882
For the most serious crimes — murder,

00:17:31.912 --> 00:17:34.842
terrorism, treason — the state can

00:17:34.922 --> 00:17:37.672
and does pursue the death penalty.

00:17:38.912 --> 00:17:40.892
New York State, where the crime was

00:17:40.892 --> 00:17:43.382
committed, no longer uses capital

00:17:43.402 --> 00:17:46.252
punishment, but this case was so

00:17:46.262 --> 00:17:49.382
high-profile, and the murder so symbolic,

00:17:49.722 --> 00:17:51.992
that prosecutors began exploring

00:17:51.992 --> 00:17:54.422
the possibility of federal charges.

00:17:55.752 --> 00:17:58.222
And at the federal level, the death

00:17:58.222 --> 00:18:00.862
penalty is still very much on the books.

00:18:02.357 --> 00:18:04.362
This is where politics elbowed

00:18:04.362 --> 00:18:06.522
its way into the judicial system.

00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:09.681
Donald Trump, during his first term,

00:18:10.036 --> 00:18:12.231
was a vocal supporter of capital

00:18:12.231 --> 00:18:14.401
punishment, even authorising a

00:18:14.401 --> 00:18:17.021
record number of federal executions

00:18:17.231 --> 00:18:18.761
in his final months in office.

00:18:19.881 --> 00:18:22.621
He argued that it was a deterrent,

00:18:22.901 --> 00:18:25.541
and in the case of heinous crimes like

00:18:25.641 --> 00:18:28.391
terrorism or murder of public officials,

00:18:28.651 --> 00:18:31.531
it was not only justified but necessary.

00:18:32.986 --> 00:18:35.766
And shortly after being sworn in for

00:18:35.766 --> 00:18:38.626
his second term, he signed an executive

00:18:38.636 --> 00:18:41.096
order pushing for capital punishment

00:18:41.316 --> 00:18:43.146
to be used whenever appropriate.

00:18:44.653 --> 00:18:46.843
The order was somewhat vague,

00:18:46.913 --> 00:18:49.183
but specified crimes in which

00:18:49.183 --> 00:18:50.573
a law-enforcement officer

00:18:50.573 --> 00:18:53.033
was killed or capital crimes

00:18:53.173 --> 00:18:55.163
committed by an illegal immigrant.

00:18:56.653 --> 00:18:58.903
To some, especially conservative

00:18:58.943 --> 00:19:01.093
commentators, the cold-blooded

00:19:01.093 --> 00:19:04.513
killing of a CEO was exactly the

00:19:04.513 --> 00:19:06.773
sort of thing Trump was referring to.

00:19:07.793 --> 00:19:11.053
They seized on the manifesto, the scrawled

00:19:11.083 --> 00:19:14.383
messages, and the symbolism of the act.

00:19:14.923 --> 00:19:16.783
They argued that this wasn’t just a

00:19:16.783 --> 00:19:19.663
killing; it was domestic terrorism.

00:19:20.453 --> 00:19:22.553
That Mangione hadn’t just murdered

00:19:22.833 --> 00:19:25.263
Brian Thompson the man, but

00:19:25.453 --> 00:19:27.703
had attempted to intimidate and

00:19:27.703 --> 00:19:30.043
destabilise an entire industry,

00:19:30.563 --> 00:19:33.153
perhaps even the American state itself.

00:19:34.403 --> 00:19:36.923
What’s more, he showed no remorse,

00:19:36.923 --> 00:19:39.243
no guilt for what he had done.

00:19:40.623 --> 00:19:43.103
In their eyes, if the death penalty

00:19:43.103 --> 00:19:45.683
wasn’t used here, when should it be?

00:19:47.103 --> 00:19:49.303
But from the other side, the

00:19:49.303 --> 00:19:50.793
case looked very different.

00:19:51.433 --> 00:19:53.043
Opponents of capital punishment

00:19:53.403 --> 00:19:55.393
pointed out that the United States is

00:19:55.393 --> 00:19:57.313
one of the last Western democracies

00:19:57.523 --> 00:19:59.453
to still execute its citizens.

00:19:59.963 --> 00:20:02.023
They argued that the death penalty

00:20:02.273 --> 00:20:05.143
doesn’t deter crime, that it’s applied

00:20:05.153 --> 00:20:07.693
inconsistently, and what’s more,

00:20:07.993 --> 00:20:10.313
that executing Mangione would risk

00:20:10.403 --> 00:20:12.623
turning him into exactly the kind

00:20:12.623 --> 00:20:15.053
of martyr he seemed to want to be.

00:20:16.493 --> 00:20:18.973
If his face was already on

00:20:19.203 --> 00:20:21.113
Che Guevara-style t-shirts,

00:20:21.283 --> 00:20:23.943
flags and mugs, executing him

00:20:24.263 --> 00:20:26.473
would send this into overdrive.

00:20:27.273 --> 00:20:29.023
So the debate spiralled.

00:20:29.643 --> 00:20:31.843
Should the state be making an example out

00:20:31.843 --> 00:20:34.563
of Mangione, in the harshest possible way?

00:20:35.223 --> 00:20:38.563
Or would doing so only validate his claim

00:20:38.573 --> 00:20:40.913
that the system is unjust and brutal?

00:20:42.383 --> 00:20:45.033
And hanging over all of this was a

00:20:45.233 --> 00:20:48.173
deeper, uncomfortable question: what

00:20:48.213 --> 00:20:50.373
pushed him to do this in the first place?

00:20:51.203 --> 00:20:53.343
Mangione wasn’t a hardened criminal.

00:20:53.773 --> 00:20:55.143
He wasn’t a man with a long

00:20:55.153 --> 00:20:56.903
record of violence, or a

00:20:56.903 --> 00:20:58.623
member of an organised gang.

00:20:58.933 --> 00:21:01.093
He was a university graduate, a young

00:21:01.093 --> 00:21:04.743
man who, on paper, had every advantage.

00:21:05.103 --> 00:21:07.253
A bright student, top of his class,

00:21:07.273 --> 00:21:09.973
with degrees and good jobs behind him.

00:21:11.153 --> 00:21:13.493
By most measures, the sort of person

00:21:13.763 --> 00:21:16.463
you might expect to be working within

00:21:16.463 --> 00:21:18.893
the system, not lashing out against it.

00:21:20.343 --> 00:21:22.913
That, in some ways, is part of

00:21:22.913 --> 00:21:24.703
what made this case so unsettling.

00:21:25.373 --> 00:21:27.333
If someone like Mangione could be

00:21:27.333 --> 00:21:29.383
radicalised to the point of taking

00:21:29.383 --> 00:21:31.543
a gun and carrying out a public

00:21:31.553 --> 00:21:33.763
assassination, and if there was so

00:21:33.763 --> 00:21:36.043
much public support for him after he

00:21:36.063 --> 00:21:38.823
did it, then what does that say about

00:21:38.833 --> 00:21:41.403
the level of anger simmering beneath

00:21:41.403 --> 00:21:43.393
the surface in American society?

00:21:44.893 --> 00:21:47.253
And this is where his story connects

00:21:47.273 --> 00:21:49.673
back to the others in this mini-series.

00:21:50.063 --> 00:21:52.323
Ross Ulbricht, Aaron Swartz, and now

00:21:52.463 --> 00:21:54.823
Luigi Mangione, three very different

00:21:54.833 --> 00:21:57.673
young men, all accused of crimes, but

00:21:57.923 --> 00:22:00.823
each one surrounded by a heated political

00:22:00.823 --> 00:22:03.403
debate that turned them from defendants

00:22:03.413 --> 00:22:06.093
in a courtroom into larger-than-life

00:22:06.093 --> 00:22:08.343
symbols of something much bigger.

00:22:09.253 --> 00:22:12.053
Ulbricht, for his supporters, wasn’t just

00:22:12.053 --> 00:22:14.703
a man who ran an online drug market; he

00:22:14.703 --> 00:22:17.673
was a digital pioneer pushing back against

00:22:17.683 --> 00:22:19.213
government control of the internet.

00:22:19.943 --> 00:22:22.353
Swartz wasn’t just someone accused of

00:22:22.383 --> 00:22:24.653
illegally downloading academic journals;

00:22:24.943 --> 00:22:27.423
he was a visionary, a martyr for the

00:22:27.453 --> 00:22:29.403
principle that knowledge should be free.

00:22:30.533 --> 00:22:33.153
And Mangione, at least to some,

00:22:33.583 --> 00:22:35.443
isn’t just a man accused of murder;

00:22:35.913 --> 00:22:37.893
he’s a warrior against a system

00:22:37.943 --> 00:22:40.363
that many see as unjust to its core.

00:22:42.193 --> 00:22:44.148
In the case of Mangione, he is the

00:22:44.178 --> 00:22:46.388
only one whose case is still pending.

00:22:46.868 --> 00:22:49.848
Ulbricht is free; Swartz is dead.

00:22:51.078 --> 00:22:53.018
His next trial date is set

00:22:53.018 --> 00:22:55.678
for September 16th, the week

00:22:55.738 --> 00:22:57.328
this episode will be released.

00:22:58.168 --> 00:23:00.418
Trump’s appointed Attorney General, Pam

00:23:00.428 --> 00:23:02.908
Bondi, has publicly instructed federal

00:23:02.908 --> 00:23:05.158
prosecutors to seek the death penalty.

00:23:06.368 --> 00:23:08.608
No doubt the outside of the courthouse

00:23:08.608 --> 00:23:10.068
will be packed with supporters

00:23:10.348 --> 00:23:12.558
holding #FreeLuigi signs, while

00:23:12.558 --> 00:23:14.578
the officials inside decide on

00:23:14.578 --> 00:23:16.178
where the process will go next.

00:23:17.198 --> 00:23:19.078
The evidence that he pulled the trigger,

00:23:19.408 --> 00:23:21.288
and that this was a premeditated

00:23:21.298 --> 00:23:23.898
murder, seems insurmountable.

00:23:24.718 --> 00:23:26.088
There seems to be little doubt

00:23:26.338 --> 00:23:28.338
that Mangione will be found guilty;

00:23:28.888 --> 00:23:31.028
the only question is how history

00:23:31.218 --> 00:23:33.598
will remember him: as a murderer,

00:23:34.128 --> 00:23:36.648
a martyr, or something in between.

00:23:38.038 --> 00:23:40.158
OK, then, that is it for today's

00:23:40.158 --> 00:23:42.818
episode on Luigi Mangione, and with

00:23:42.818 --> 00:23:44.218
it comes the end of this three-part

00:23:44.218 --> 00:23:46.818
mini-series on Young American Outlaws.

00:23:47.248 --> 00:23:48.508
I hope it's been an interesting one

00:23:48.798 --> 00:23:50.398
and that you've learnt something new.

00:23:50.928 --> 00:23:52.628
As always, I would love to know

00:23:52.628 --> 00:23:54.148
what you thought of this episode,

00:23:54.418 --> 00:23:56.198
and of this mini-series in general.

00:23:56.748 --> 00:23:57.968
Ross Ulbricht, Aaron

00:23:57.968 --> 00:23:59.568
Swartz and Luigi Mangione.

00:23:59.708 --> 00:24:01.958
What do you think about their stories,

00:24:02.074 --> 00:24:04.508
and their crimes, or alleged crimes?

00:24:05.058 --> 00:24:06.198
Is it fair to lump them

00:24:06.198 --> 00:24:07.588
all in a similar category?

00:24:07.996 --> 00:24:09.850
Are there similar stories in your country?

00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:12.180
I would love to know, so let’s

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:13.530
get this discussion started.

00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:15.010

00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:16.740

chatting away to other curious minds.

00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:24.320

00:24:27.530 --> 00:24:30.240
I'm Alastair Budge, you stay safe, and

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:32.560
I'll catch you in the next episode.
