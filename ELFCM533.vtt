Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.569 --> 00:00:17.189
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories and learn weird and

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:21.599
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:26.989
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is the start of another three-part

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:32.929
mini-series, this time on the broad theme of important scientific discovery.

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.099
In part one, today’s episode, which is going to be appropriately released

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:43.529
on February 28th, we are going to talk about the science of leap years.

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:50.256
In part two, we will talk about the discovery of the blueprint of life: DNA.

00:00:50.635 --> 00:00:56.329
And in part three we will talk about how the way in which mathematics changed the world.

00:00:57.009 --> 00:01:01.939
OK then, let’s get right into it, and talk about leap years.

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:07.389
Sometimes, it seems that the natural world has been

00:01:07.389 --> 00:01:11.429
created in complete harmony with mathematic principles.

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:16.059
The Fibonacci sequence, for example, is a sequence of

00:01:16.059 --> 00:01:20.919
numbers where each new number is the sum of the previous two.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:28.319
0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13, and so on.

00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:35.129
As any mathematician knows, the Fibonacci Sequence crops up throughout the discipline of

00:01:35.129 --> 00:01:43.749
mathematics, but it can also be found in nature, in sunflowers, pinecones, pineapples, and so on.

00:01:44.809 --> 00:01:51.919
Then there’s the so-called “Golden Ratio”, a number approximately equal to 1.618,

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:57.819
which has been called the “perfect proportion” and has often been claimed to show

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:03.558
up in everything from the spiral of a shell to the proportions of the human body.

00:02:04.296 --> 00:02:06.726
But it’s not just in living things.

00:02:07.196 --> 00:02:13.676
Hurricane spirals, galaxies, and even the structure of DNA reflect this ratio,

00:02:14.206 --> 00:02:20.606
almost as if the universe itself is built on a foundation of mathematical elegance.

00:02:21.926 --> 00:02:26.216
But, there are some exceptions to this natural elegance.

00:02:27.006 --> 00:02:30.866
One example is the Earth’s orbit around the sun.

00:02:31.418 --> 00:02:38.068
It takes, as we both know, 24 hours for the Earth to rotate on its axis.

00:02:38.788 --> 00:02:42.858
This is a “solar day”, the time it takes for the Sun to

00:02:42.858 --> 00:02:46.708
return to the same position in the sky, as seen from Earth.

00:02:47.628 --> 00:02:53.798
That’s simple enough, but there is a much larger problem with the Earth’s orbit,

00:02:54.238 --> 00:02:59.358
and that’s related to how long the Earth takes to go all the way around the sun.

00:03:00.258 --> 00:03:03.748
Or to put it another way, the length of “a year”.

00:03:04.758 --> 00:03:08.738
As we know, a year is 365 days.

00:03:09.278 --> 00:03:15.638
Apart from it isn’t exactly 365 days, it's a little bit longer than that.

00:03:15.928 --> 00:03:23.678
To be precise, it takes more like 365.2421988 days for

00:03:23.678 --> 00:03:27.078
the Earth to complete one full orbit around the sun.

00:03:28.098 --> 00:03:35.468
Or to put it in easier terms to understand, it takes 365 days and just under 6 hours.

00:03:36.508 --> 00:03:42.978
This imprecision is the reason humans created today’s topic: the leap year.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:51.010
It is a neat and tidy solution to the problem of Earth’s inexact orbit, and although on

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:56.060
the face of it, it might seem like there’s nothing more to it than adding an extra day

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.950
to February every four years, it is actually a little bit more complicated than that.

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:09.320
So, to start off this exploration of the science of leap years, we need to go back to the start.

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:15.260
For prehistoric humans who cared little about the details of the calendar,

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:22.380
the fact that a year wasn’t exactly 365 days was of little importance.

00:04:23.013 --> 00:04:27.153
The sun rose in the morning and set in the evening, the

00:04:27.153 --> 00:04:32.473
moon waxed and waned, and the stars moved across the sky.

00:04:33.783 --> 00:04:39.453
Those further away from the Equator had warmer seasons and colder seasons when

00:04:39.453 --> 00:04:44.493
they got more or less daylight, given the fact that the Earth is on a slight tilt.

00:04:45.933 --> 00:04:51.923
Prehistoric man’s life was marked by these seasons, which would come and go on

00:04:51.923 --> 00:04:58.103
a predictable schedule - what we now call spring, summer, autumn and winter.

00:04:59.473 --> 00:05:04.323
As humans became more settled, and civilisation started to develop,

00:05:04.923 --> 00:05:08.563
they started paying closer attention to the passage of time.

00:05:09.843 --> 00:05:14.333
Early civilisations began to notice and document patterns.

00:05:15.078 --> 00:05:21.062
The Nile would flood at the same time every year, animals would migrate on a

00:05:21.102 --> 00:05:27.342
predictable schedule, and the stars would appear in the same positions at certain times.

00:05:28.592 --> 00:05:31.692
It didn’t take long for people to realise that the cycle

00:05:31.702 --> 00:05:37.252
of the seasons repeated approximately every 365 days.

00:05:38.052 --> 00:05:41.522
And with this, the first calendars were born.

00:05:42.662 --> 00:05:48.982
Many of these early calendars were, in fact, based on the moon rather than the sun.

00:05:50.242 --> 00:05:54.022
A lunar cycle – the time it takes for the moon to go

00:05:54.042 --> 00:05:58.892
from one full moon to the next – is about 29.5 days.

00:06:00.062 --> 00:06:06.122
Twelve of these lunar months make up roughly 354 days, so

00:06:06.402 --> 00:06:10.939
11 days less than a solar year, but it was near enough.

00:06:11.399 --> 00:06:13.309
And this was fine for a while.

00:06:13.999 --> 00:06:20.419
Many ancient civilisations, including the Babylonians and early Greeks, used lunar

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:26.549
calendars and simply adjusted them as needed, often by adding extra months to catch up.

00:06:27.879 --> 00:06:35.079
After all, yes there was some external trade, but so long as everyone within a particular settlement

00:06:35.079 --> 00:06:41.889
or area knew what the date was, it was relatively easy to adjust it without too much complication.

00:06:43.299 --> 00:06:49.939
But as societies grew more complex, so did their need for a more precise calendar,

00:06:50.429 --> 00:06:55.499
a calendar that accurately aligned with the Earth’s orbit around the sun.

00:06:57.199 --> 00:07:00.819
That calendar was, of course, the solar calendar.

00:07:01.849 --> 00:07:06.399
And it was the Egyptians who were among the first to adopt it.

00:07:07.089 --> 00:07:13.289
By observing the annual flooding of the Nile and tracking the movements of the star Sirius,

00:07:13.559 --> 00:07:22.969
they estimated a year to be about 365.25 days—remarkably close to the actual solar year.

00:07:24.339 --> 00:07:30.169
Now was the question of how to divide up those days into sensible chunks.

00:07:31.049 --> 00:07:37.459
Their calendar had 12 months of 30 days, with 5 extra days

00:07:37.629 --> 00:07:41.584
tacked on at the end of the year as a sort of annual festival.

00:07:42.754 --> 00:07:46.844
This was a big improvement–after all, it is very

00:07:46.844 --> 00:07:50.654
similar to what we have today–but it wasn’t perfect.

00:07:52.074 --> 00:07:59.277
Over time, the slight discrepancy between 365 days and the true length of the

00:07:59.277 --> 00:08:05.189
solar year added up, causing the calendar to drift out of sync with the seasons.

00:08:06.709 --> 00:08:12.219
Fast forward to ancient Rome, the calendar was even more of a mess.

00:08:13.519 --> 00:08:20.639
The original Roman calendar had only 10 months, starting in March and ending in December.

00:08:21.679 --> 00:08:27.459
The names of our modern months still reflect this: “September” comes from the Latin

00:08:27.459 --> 00:08:33.619
word for “seven” but is our 9th month of the year, “October” comes from the Latin

00:08:33.619 --> 00:08:38.809
word for “eight” but is our tenth month of the year, and it’s a similar story with

00:08:39.049 --> 00:08:43.869
“November,” and “December”, which come from the Latin words for nine, and ten.

00:08:45.229 --> 00:08:52.519
At the time, winter was not assigned official months—the period roughly covering what we now

00:08:52.519 --> 00:08:59.559
call January and February was simply considered a dead time, an unstructured gap in the calendar.

00:09:01.039 --> 00:09:07.399
In practice, this meant that the Roman calendar was an administrative nightmare,

00:09:07.999 --> 00:09:13.239
and there were long gaps where the calendar didn’t align with the seasons at all.

00:09:14.059 --> 00:09:19.009
Farmers would be planting crops at the wrong times, festivals would drift

00:09:19.029 --> 00:09:24.049
across the seasons, and even military campaigns could be thrown into

00:09:24.139 --> 00:09:29.299
disarray because the calendar no longer aligned with the natural world.

00:09:30.639 --> 00:09:37.209
To make matters worse, powerful officials exploited this confusion for their own benefit.

00:09:38.359 --> 00:09:44.249
If extending a year or shortening it could help them stay in power or delay an

00:09:44.309 --> 00:09:48.609
opponent’s election, they would simply adjust the calendar to suit their needs.

00:09:49.849 --> 00:09:56.629
It was eventually expanded to 12 months, with January and February added at the start of the year.

00:09:57.019 --> 00:09:59.419
But it was still pretty chaotic.

00:10:00.597 --> 00:10:07.249
By the time Julius Caesar came to power, the Roman calendar had drifted so far out of

00:10:07.249 --> 00:10:13.239
sync with the solar year that seasons were arriving three months earlier than they should.

00:10:14.174 --> 00:10:18.429
Spring festivals were being celebrated in the middle of winter,

00:10:18.909 --> 00:10:23.649
and the practical workings of Roman society were falling apart.

00:10:24.789 --> 00:10:32.270
Caesar, a man who prided himself on his organisational ability, decided this couldn’t continue.

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:40.640
In 46 BCE, with the help of Greek astronomers, he reformed the calendar entirely.

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:44.620
The Julian calendar, as it came to be known, was

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:50.170
based on the solar year, with a length of 365.25 days.

00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:57.850
To account for that extra 0.25 days each year, Caesar introduced

00:10:57.910 --> 00:11:03.200
the leap year, adding an extra day to February every four years.

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:10.980
It was a simple and elegant solution, and it brought order back to the Roman world.

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:17.490
No longer would festivals and planting seasons drift aimlessly through the year.

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:21.500
The calendar was now tied to the cycles of the Sun.

00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:26.640
But there was a small problem with Caesar’s calculations.

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:37.940
The solar year isn’t actually 365.25 days long—it’s 365.2421988 days.

00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:48.160
That difference of about 11 minutes per year might seem tiny, but over time, it added up.

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:55.680
By the 16th century, the calendar had drifted out of alignment with the seasons once again.

00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:02.220
This time, it was Pope Gregory XIII who decided to fix the problem.

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:11.476
In 1582, Pope Gregory introduced a new calendar, which we now call the Gregorian calendar.

00:12:12.498 --> 00:12:17.040
To correct the drift, 10 days were skipped that year.

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:27.000
People in Catholic countries went to bed on the 4th of October and woke up on the 15th of October.

00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:35.033
If you search for great events that happened in France, Italy, or Spain on the 5th or

00:12:35.033 --> 00:12:41.710
the 6th or the 7th of October, 1582, there were none because those days didn’t happen.

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:48.070
Gregory also introduced a new rule to refine leap years.

00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:57.840
Under the Gregorian system, a year would only be a leap year if it was divisible by 4, but

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:06.960
century years, like 1800 or 1900, wouldn’t be leap years unless they were also divisible by 400.

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:14.040
That’s why the year 2000, as you may remember, and the year 1600, which

00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:18.870
you will not remember, were leap years; they can be divided by 400.

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:26.820
And the year 2096 will be a leap year, but the year 2100

00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:32.990
will not be a leap year because you can’t divide 2100 by 400.

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:41.020
Anyway, this refinement brought the calendar back in line with the solar year and solved

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:47.170
the 11-minute-per-year drift problem for good—or at least, for the foreseeable future.

00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:53.150
Even so, adopting the Gregorian calendar wasn’t a smooth process.

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:58.130
Protestant countries were suspicious of this decidedly

00:13:58.210 --> 00:14:02.270
Catholic reform and refused to adopt it at first.

00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:08.288
England and its colonies didn’t make the switch until 1752.

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:14.920
By then, the Julian calendar was 11 days out of sync with

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:19.040
the Gregorian calendar, so those 11 days had to be skipped.

00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:28.920
Just as people in Catholic countries did in October 1582, in 1752, anyone living in

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:36.600
the British Empire went to bed on September the 2nd and woke up on September the 14th.

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:42.430
It caused confusion, frustration, and even protests, but

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:46.600
eventually, the Gregorian calendar became the global standard.

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:54.140
Although other calendars are used, often for cultural or religious purposes, the

00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:59.340
Gregorian calendar is the most widely used civil calendar across the world today.

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:07.080
But it’s perhaps worth asking: is the Gregorian calendar the final word on how we measure time?

00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:14.130
Could there be better ways to organise our year, and solve the problem of leap years for good?

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:20.650
Calendar reform is not just a historical curiosity—it’s a topic that

00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:25.390
continues to fascinate astronomers, mathematicians, and even policymakers.

00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:30.830
So, before we go, let’s talk briefly about some of these ideas.

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:36.580
One of the more radical ideas is the concept of a perpetual

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:40.990
calendar, where every year would follow exactly the same pattern.

00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:49.240
In such a system, each date would always fall on the same day of the week, making planning simpler.

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:53.370
For example, 1 January would always be a Monday.

00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:58.860
One version of this is something called The International

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:03.110
Fixed Calendar, which was proposed in the early 20th century.

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:12.730
Under this system, the year would be divided into 13 months of exactly 28 days each, with one or

00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:18.960
two extra days outside the calendar entirely—holidays that wouldn’t belong to any month or week.

00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:25.810
While such a system would perhaps streamline record-keeping, you’d

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:31.310
still need a mechanism for those extra ~0.24 days a year, and this

00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:35.040
solution isn’t really any neater than the current leap year system.

00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:42.900
Another intriguing idea is the World Calendar, which divides the year into 12 months,

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:49.550
but the focus is on quarters–blocks of three months–rather than individual months.

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:58.560
Each quarter would contain three months: two months with 30 days and one with 31 days.

00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:05.420
This consistent quarterly structure would make the calendar predictable, and an extra

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:11.860
day—a year-end holiday outside the regular calendar—would be added to balance the total.

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:18.490
Leap years would include one more extra day, often called a “leap day,” similarly

00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:24.740
placed outside the calendar structure. This system would retain the 12-month

00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:30.780
format we’re familiar with but introduce regularity and symmetry within the year.

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:38.630
Now, while both of these are perhaps interesting ideas, they have never gained serious traction.

00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:43.690
You still have the problem of a year not being exactly 365

00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:48.730
days, so some sort of extra days need to be added somewhere.

00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:52.990
And then there’s the most ambitious idea of all:

00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:57.320
changing the speed of the Earth’s orbit around the sun.

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:07.380
If the Earth’s orbit around the Sun could be adjusted so that it took exactly 365 days, rather than

00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:14.830
just over 365 days, we wouldn’t need leap years at all, and we could keep the same calendar system.

00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:20.660
Unfortunately, this is impossible, with today’s technology at least.

00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:25.790
The Earth’s orbit is governed by the gravitational pull of the

00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:31.250
Sun and the balance between that pull and the planet’s velocity.

00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:36.440
To change the speed of the Earth’s orbit, we would need

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:40.930
to either increase or decrease its velocity significantly.

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:48.060
This would require an unimaginable amount of energy—far beyond what humanity could ever generate.

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:55.250
And even if it were possible, the unintended consequences could be catastrophic.

00:18:56.260 --> 00:19:01.000
Changing the speed of the Earth’s orbit would affect the gravitational balance of the

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:06.700
entire solar system, potentially destabilising the orbits of other planets and moons.

00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:10.790
It could even disrupt the delicate conditions that make life on

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:14.730
Earth possible, such as our climate and the length of the seasons.

00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:20.050
It’s an interesting thought experiment but not one that’s grounded in reality.

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:23.040
What’s more, it’s not really necessary.

00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:30.000
Leap years aren’t so bad at all, and the Gregorian calendar and its cunning system of

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:36.210
calculating which years to add extra days to, while imperfect, is a pretty clever solution.

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.160
Could it be improved?

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:39.450
Perhaps.

00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:42.530
But there really is very little need to do so.

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:46.990
Sometimes, the systems we inherit endure not because

00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:50.340
they are perfect but because they work well enough.

00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:56.010
So, to wrap things up, today, we hardly need to think about leap years.

00:19:56.457 --> 00:20:01.300
They’re a part of life, quietly keeping our calendars in sync with the seasons.

00:20:01.816 --> 00:20:08.110
But when you stop to consider them, they’re an incredible testament to human ingenuity.

00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:13.470
They show how, even thousands of years ago, we were observing,

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.760
calculating, and innovating to make sense of the universe.

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:23.970
And they remind us that while the natural world may not be perfectly elegant,

00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:29.350
our ability to adapt and find solutions is something truly remarkable.

00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:36.020
OK then, that is it for today's episode on the science of leap years.

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:39.790
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.
