Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo

00:00:11.523 --> 00:00:16.393
English, the show where you can listen to fascinating stories and learn weird

00:00:16.583 --> 00:00:21.113
and wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.473 --> 00:00:27.603
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about the history of mercenaries.

00:00:28.092 --> 00:00:30.901
It is a fascinating story, and will take us from the

00:00:30.901 --> 00:00:35.171
Italian Renaissance to the Iraq War to modern-day Ukraine.

00:00:35.681 --> 00:00:40.281
We will explore how the nature of mercenaries has evolved over time,

00:00:40.651 --> 00:00:45.661
the changing reasons to use or not to use mercenary forces, and what

00:00:45.681 --> 00:00:50.495
this means for the grim business of warfare in the 21st century.

00:00:51.577 --> 00:00:57.047
Alright then, let’s get cracking and talk about the history of mercenaries.

00:00:59.537 --> 00:01:07.787
In 2016 Forbes Magazine published an article titled “The Rise of the Freelancer Economy”.

00:01:08.617 --> 00:01:14.567
In it, the author wrote, and I’m quoting directly, “Who says you can’t drive an Uber in

00:01:14.567 --> 00:01:20.620
the morning, design websites all afternoon, and cater your own food company at night?”

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:29.160
He went on to claim that by the year 2020, 50% of the US workforce would be freelance.

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.866
Now, this hasn’t happened, the true number is around 38%.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:43.420
And in fact, the idea of this being “new” or “on the rise” is also somewhat problematic.

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.890
Even the word “freelance” in English gives us a clue about

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.500
the age of the idea of not being tied to one boss or master.

00:01:54.383 --> 00:02:01.817
It was coined in the early 19th century but to refer to European knights in the Medieval Era who

00:02:01.817 --> 00:02:08.827
were not ideologically or politically aligned with any one ruler and who would fight for money.

00:02:10.347 --> 00:02:16.407
They often carried lances, which are the long pointy spears that they would hold out

00:02:16.407 --> 00:02:22.697
in front of their galloping horses, and these lances were free, or at least freely

00:02:22.707 --> 00:02:27.797
available to the highest bidder, the person who was prepared to pay the most money.

00:02:29.291 --> 00:02:33.801
These “freelancers” are what we might today call “mercenaries”,

00:02:34.281 --> 00:02:38.831
professional soldiers who fight on behalf of whoever will pay.

00:02:39.791 --> 00:02:46.207
Now, the term “mercenary” is also a little problematic, and we will come to

00:02:46.207 --> 00:02:50.377
discuss the different types of mercenaries as we move through the episode.

00:02:51.287 --> 00:02:54.727
And, of course, the idea of someone being a mercenary

00:02:55.057 --> 00:02:58.047
did not start in the medieval era or in Europe.

00:02:58.667 --> 00:03:03.127
There is evidence of mercenary fighters all over the world and throughout

00:03:03.157 --> 00:03:09.097
history: Ancient Persia, Carthage, Qin Dynasty China, and Ancient Egypt.

00:03:09.967 --> 00:03:15.017
It made sense, back then, just as it does in some cases now.

00:03:16.068 --> 00:03:20.541
Keeping a fully-trained army was and still is a very

00:03:20.571 --> 00:03:24.051
expensive thing to do, especially for a small state.

00:03:25.192 --> 00:03:30.487
And before the idea of nationhood that we have today, before this

00:03:30.507 --> 00:03:35.737
notion of nationality and belonging to a country, it was understandably

00:03:35.977 --> 00:03:42.296
harder to convince someone to fight and die on a battlefield for…what?

00:03:42.887 --> 00:03:43.767
For glory?

00:03:44.187 --> 00:03:48.007
For loyalty to a ruler they would almost certainly never meet?

00:03:49.257 --> 00:03:54.517
The Roman poet Horace famously wrote “Dulce et decorum est pro

00:03:54.547 --> 00:03:59.697
patria mori” - “It is sweet and right to die for one’s homeland”.

00:04:00.947 --> 00:04:06.337
This might make for a nice line in a poem, but the reality of convincing

00:04:06.337 --> 00:04:12.617
someone to risk their life for an abstract ideal like glory or loyalty,

00:04:12.857 --> 00:04:18.027
especially before the modern idea of nationhood, well, it was difficult.

00:04:18.927 --> 00:04:21.237
But how about fighting for money?

00:04:21.997 --> 00:04:23.797
Money was universal.

00:04:24.107 --> 00:04:26.587
It talked then, just as it talks now.

00:04:27.307 --> 00:04:30.087
Throughout history there have been people willing to

00:04:30.097 --> 00:04:32.947
lay their lives on the line, for a fee, of course.

00:04:33.757 --> 00:04:39.847
Now, to explore the idea of mercenaries, we are going to focus on three

00:04:40.037 --> 00:04:45.312
particular groups of mercenaries, one, hundreds of years old, another, three

00:04:45.312 --> 00:04:50.182
decades old, and another where the story is unfortunately still unfolding.

00:04:50.982 --> 00:04:55.622
Our first stop on this mercenary tour is Renaissance Italy.

00:04:56.682 --> 00:04:59.352
Renaissance Italy was a chaotic place.

00:04:59.592 --> 00:05:06.462
It was not the unified country we know today, but a collection of city-states—Venice, Florence,

00:05:06.492 --> 00:05:14.092
Milan, the Papal States, Naples—each one with its own ruler, ambitions, and, often, enemies.

00:05:15.256 --> 00:05:18.746
These city-states were frequently at war with each other,

00:05:18.926 --> 00:05:22.956
whether over trade, territory, or sheer political rivalry.

00:05:23.686 --> 00:05:31.596
But there was one big problem: maintaining a standing army was expensive, and these city-states,

00:05:31.826 --> 00:05:37.536
wealthy as they were, preferred to spend their money on art, architecture, and trade.

00:05:38.146 --> 00:05:43.076
So, instead of building their own armies, they turned to mercenaries.

00:05:43.978 --> 00:05:49.831
These mercenaries were organised into companies led by people called condottieri.

00:05:51.228 --> 00:05:57.758
The word condottieri comes from the Italian word condotta, which means “conduct” or

00:05:57.758 --> 00:06:04.808
“behaviour” in modern Italian, but in the Renaissance era meant “contract” or “agreement.”

00:06:06.148 --> 00:06:10.958
These condottieri were leaders of mercenary bands, hired

00:06:11.198 --> 00:06:15.478
through a formal contract to fight on behalf of a city-state.

00:06:16.248 --> 00:06:21.808
They were professional soldiers who would hire out their services to the highest bidder.

00:06:22.388 --> 00:06:28.198
They didn’t fight for loyalty, honour, or patriotism—they fought for money.

00:06:29.208 --> 00:06:36.188
And for the rulers of Renaissance Italy, this arrangement worked well…at least, in theory.

00:06:37.138 --> 00:06:42.358
But there was a catch: these condottieri weren’t exactly loyal.

00:06:42.988 --> 00:06:46.828
If one city-state offered them a better deal, they might

00:06:46.898 --> 00:06:50.778
abandon their current employer—or worse, turn against them.

00:06:51.598 --> 00:06:56.438
One example of this was a man called Francesco Sforza, who

00:06:56.438 --> 00:06:59.778
was one of the most famous condottieri of the 15th century.

00:07:00.938 --> 00:07:08.358
In the 1440s, Sforza was hired by the city of Milan to defend it against its rivals.

00:07:09.178 --> 00:07:15.188
But rather than simply doing his job, Sforza saw an opportunity.

00:07:15.918 --> 00:07:20.288
He betrayed Milan’s rulers, used his mercenary army to seize

00:07:20.288 --> 00:07:24.385
control of the city, and declared himself Duke of Milan.

00:07:25.515 --> 00:07:31.685
As you might imagine, for the condottieri, their primary driver was maximising their profit.

00:07:32.545 --> 00:07:36.425
So, unlike modern armies, the condottieri didn’t

00:07:36.465 --> 00:07:40.886
necessarily aim to win battles quickly or decisively.

00:07:41.566 --> 00:07:46.556
There was little advantage to be had in slaughtering your enemy and completely

00:07:46.786 --> 00:07:51.676
eliminating the threat, as is often the goal in modern combat scenarios.

00:07:52.286 --> 00:07:57.221
Doing this could well mean that you would be out of your job, because your master might

00:07:57.221 --> 00:08:03.011
well say, “ok then, great job, you can go now, your services are no longer required”.

00:08:03.971 --> 00:08:11.451
So, many of them preferred to drag out conflicts because it meant longer contracts and more money.

00:08:12.351 --> 00:08:15.711
And battles were often avoided altogether.

00:08:16.517 --> 00:08:20.741
Instead, the condottieri would rely on sieges, ambushes,

00:08:20.771 --> 00:08:25.081
and psychological tactics to wear down their opponents.

00:08:25.931 --> 00:08:30.141
This style of warfare was pragmatic and cost-effective for the

00:08:30.151 --> 00:08:34.301
mercenaries but often frustrating for the rulers who hired them.

00:08:35.481 --> 00:08:40.921
And when there were battles, they often weren’t battles as you might think of them.

00:08:42.171 --> 00:08:46.541
One famous example of this came from a place called Anghiari.

00:08:47.501 --> 00:08:54.371
Anghiari is a wonderful Tuscan hill town, but it is a sleepy place: there are more

00:08:54.371 --> 00:09:01.771
residents who are over the age of 75 than are under 18, and not an awful lot happens there.

00:09:03.161 --> 00:09:09.519
It is perhaps most famous for The Battle of Anghiari, which took place in 1440.

00:09:10.591 --> 00:09:15.389
It was fought between forces loyal to the Duchy of Milan, and a

00:09:15.389 --> 00:09:20.329
consortium of fighters loyal to Florence, The Papal States, and Venice.

00:09:21.219 --> 00:09:26.279
The battle involved thousands of soldiers, lasted an entire day,

00:09:26.639 --> 00:09:30.639
and was commemorated in a painting by Leonardo Da Vinci, in which

00:09:30.649 --> 00:09:35.214
fearsome warriors tussle with each other on top of magnificent horses.

00:09:36.474 --> 00:09:41.844
The reality, though, is that there was about as much blood spilt in the

00:09:41.863 --> 00:09:49.427
Battle of Anghiari as there is on a typical day in Anghiari in 2025: none.

00:09:50.867 --> 00:09:55.787
So the legend goes, despite the thousands of soldiers, there was only one

00:09:55.787 --> 00:10:01.409
death, and this was from someone who accidentally fell off their horse.

00:10:02.639 --> 00:10:08.919
The battle was fought by condottieri, and they simply had little interest in killing each other.

00:10:09.576 --> 00:10:15.048
Everyone would be far better off if they pretended to fight a little, and they could

00:10:15.048 --> 00:10:20.298
return to their masters with a large invoice and the prospect of more work to come.

00:10:21.368 --> 00:10:27.028
Now, this was an extreme example, but it is reflective of the often

00:10:27.258 --> 00:10:31.878
misalignment of interests between the mercenary and his master.

00:10:33.378 --> 00:10:39.908
And by the late 15th century, the golden age of the condottieri was coming to an end.

00:10:40.648 --> 00:10:43.528
There were several reasons for this decline.

00:10:44.058 --> 00:10:48.148
First, the rise of more centralised states, like France and

00:10:48.148 --> 00:10:52.598
Spain, this brought larger, more disciplined armies to Italy.

00:10:53.198 --> 00:10:58.748
These national armies didn’t rely on mercenaries—they had received better

00:10:58.748 --> 00:11:03.468
training, were loyal to the state and often more effective in battle.

00:11:04.898 --> 00:11:11.728
Second, the unpredictable and self-serving nature of the condottieri made them a liability.

00:11:12.918 --> 00:11:18.158
While they'd been useful in the fragmented world of Renaissance Italy, they were no

00:11:18.158 --> 00:11:23.508
match for the organised, professional forces that began to dominate European warfare.

00:11:24.668 --> 00:11:30.088
Finally, the development of new military technologies, such as firearms

00:11:30.088 --> 00:11:35.198
and cannons, this required specialised training and coordination—it

00:11:35.198 --> 00:11:38.818
was something that mercenary bands were not equipped to handle.

00:11:39.796 --> 00:11:45.851
Now, despite their decline, the condottieri left a lasting mark on the history of warfare.

00:11:46.591 --> 00:11:51.561
They were some of the first to formalise the idea of a professional

00:11:51.581 --> 00:11:55.975
fighting force, complete with contracts and structured payment systems.

00:11:56.865 --> 00:12:02.955
Now, for our second mercenary group, we are going to move forward almost to the present day.

00:12:04.135 --> 00:12:09.415
Our next stop takes us to the late 20th and early 21st centuries, where

00:12:09.415 --> 00:12:15.665
we find a new type of mercenary emerging—not roaming soldiers with lances,

00:12:16.001 --> 00:12:21.075
but organised, corporate entities offering military services for profit.

00:12:22.318 --> 00:12:26.481
Among these, one name stands out: Blackwater.

00:12:27.658 --> 00:12:35.441
Blackwater was founded in 1997 by a man named Erik Prince, a former U.S. Navy SEAL.

00:12:36.121 --> 00:12:40.921
He had spent two years in the SEALs before dropping out to start a company

00:12:41.001 --> 00:12:45.581
that he initially thought would focus on training for special operations.

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:51.651
Helped in no small part by the fact that his father sold a company for over a billion

00:12:51.651 --> 00:12:58.411
dollars, the young Prince bought 24 square kilometres of swampland in North Carolina.

00:12:59.451 --> 00:13:05.361
The idea was simple: he had this massive swathe of land, and his company

00:13:05.531 --> 00:13:10.201
would train law enforcement officers in key special operations techniques.

00:13:11.411 --> 00:13:14.691
And initially, this is what Blackwater did.

00:13:15.231 --> 00:13:19.281
But in the aftermath of the September 11th attacks in

00:13:19.291 --> 00:13:24.531
2001, Blackwater’s business transformed almost overnight.

00:13:25.571 --> 00:13:31.271
The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq created an enormous demand for private

00:13:31.271 --> 00:13:37.061
contractors, and Blackwater was quick to position itself as a key player.

00:13:38.321 --> 00:13:41.281
The company didn’t just provide training anymore.

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:48.940
It started offering security services, logistical support, and even armed combat capabilities.

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:50.540
Soldiers, essentially.

00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:57.640
At the height of the Iraq War, Blackwater became one of the most prominent private

00:13:57.650 --> 00:14:02.690
military companies in the world, securing lucrative contracts from the U.S. government.

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:06.980
At one point, it was reported that Blackwater personnel

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:10.520
outnumbered American troops in some regions of Iraq.

00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:16.450
This was a new kind of mercenary force—corporate, professional,

00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:20.760
and deeply tied to modern warfare’s complex logistics.

00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:25.300
However, with this rise to prominence came controversy.

00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:31.010
In 2007, Blackwater contractors were involved in an incident

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:35.240
that became infamous: the Nisour Square massacre in Baghdad.

00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:40.850
During a security mission, Blackwater guards opened fire on a crowded

00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:45.910
intersection, killing 17 Iraqi civilians and injuring many more.

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:52.240
The event sparked international outrage and led to accusations that private

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:56.930
contractors like Blackwater lacked the accountability of regular armed forces,

00:14:57.290 --> 00:15:03.240
operated with impunity, and existed outside the bounds of military law.

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:06.360
And this is an interesting point.

00:15:06.912 --> 00:15:13.060
Mercenaries are considered differently from ordinary soldiers when it comes to international law.

00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:18.290
Under the Geneva Convention, they are not considered lawful

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:21.780
combatants, so they don’t receive the same protections.

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:27.229
Now, there are all sorts of loopholes here about who is and who

00:15:27.259 --> 00:15:32.192
isn’t a mercenary, and the definition isn’t always so clear.

00:15:33.042 --> 00:15:36.932
To give you an example, let’s just take the same person.

00:15:37.502 --> 00:15:39.902
Bill is a United States citizen.

00:15:40.352 --> 00:15:45.742
He signs up for the regular army, he receives a salary, and he is sent to war.

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:49.549
Bill is a regular soldier, not a mercenary.

00:15:50.279 --> 00:15:56.519
But let’s say that Bill leaves the regular army and joins a company like Blackwater.

00:15:57.199 --> 00:16:02.559
He still receives a salary, and he is sent to war, or probably more accurately,

00:16:02.799 --> 00:16:07.599
he is “sent to provide security services in a warzone”. It’s still the same

00:16:07.609 --> 00:16:12.029
Bill, he is still in the same place, fighting for the same United States.

00:16:12.819 --> 00:16:16.259
Is he now a mercenary just because his contract is with a

00:16:16.299 --> 00:16:19.379
private company rather than with the United States government?

00:16:20.029 --> 00:16:24.359
And therefore, should he be treated differently when it comes to international law?

00:16:25.682 --> 00:16:28.759
As you can see, the lines aren’t always so clear.

00:16:29.299 --> 00:16:31.039
But back to Blackwater.

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:36.079
After the controversy of the Nisour Square massacre, and growing criticism

00:16:36.259 --> 00:16:40.849
about how much money it was making from the US government, it rebranded

00:16:40.849 --> 00:16:46.429
itself several times and has been sold and repackaged on numerous occasions.

00:16:47.289 --> 00:16:53.409
Today, it operates as part of a holding group called Constellis, and it is perhaps

00:16:53.409 --> 00:16:58.779
the most prominent example of the privatisation and commercialisation of war.

00:16:59.779 --> 00:17:04.229
But Blackwater is far from the only example of modern

00:17:04.229 --> 00:17:08.739
mercenaries, or Private Military Contractors, PMCs for short.

00:17:09.999 --> 00:17:14.089
Our final stop takes us to the modern-day and one of the most

00:17:14.139 --> 00:17:17.879
controversial mercenary groups in the world: the Wagner Group.

00:17:19.369 --> 00:17:25.579
If Blackwater represented the corporate face of modern mercenaries, Wagner is

00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:31.279
something altogether different—a shadowy organisation that blends private military

00:17:31.309 --> 00:17:37.216
operations with state interests, operating in a legal and ethical grey zone.

00:17:38.566 --> 00:17:42.886
The Wagner Group emerged in 2014 during Russia’s

00:17:42.936 --> 00:17:46.956
annexation of Crimea and the conflict in Eastern Ukraine.

00:17:48.139 --> 00:17:54.771
It was founded by a man named Yevgeny Prigozhin, a businessman with close ties to Vladimir

00:17:54.771 --> 00:18:00.881
Putin, and Dmitry Utkin, a former officer in Russia’s military intelligence service.

00:18:01.783 --> 00:18:07.243
Officially, Wagner is a private military company, a PMC, but in

00:18:07.243 --> 00:18:11.313
practice, it operates as an unofficial arm of the Russian government,

00:18:11.683 --> 00:18:15.503
carrying out missions that Moscow cannot officially acknowledge.

00:18:16.693 --> 00:18:20.383
It first gained international attention for its role in Ukraine,

00:18:20.603 --> 00:18:24.593
where its fighters were involved in key battles in the Donbas region.

00:18:25.673 --> 00:18:29.213
These mercenaries were well-equipped and well-trained.

00:18:29.743 --> 00:18:36.063
They were often recruited from Russian special forces or veterans of elite military units.

00:18:37.183 --> 00:18:43.229
Unlike regular soldiers, Wagner’s troops operated with plausible deniability,

00:18:43.633 --> 00:18:47.913
allowing Russia to maintain a degree of separation from their actions.

00:18:49.033 --> 00:18:54.773
The use of Wagner troops also meant that Putin could delay his partial mobilisation,

00:18:55.163 --> 00:19:00.493
the calling up of reservist troops from the general population, and thus continue

00:19:00.543 --> 00:19:05.613
his claim that this was not a war that would affect the regular Russian population.

00:19:06.923 --> 00:19:12.473
As you may know, that didn’t last particularly long, just 7 months after the invasion.

00:19:13.353 --> 00:19:17.503
But Wagner’s activities extend far beyond Ukraine.

00:19:18.193 --> 00:19:21.763
The group has been involved in conflicts across the Middle East and

00:19:21.763 --> 00:19:26.653
Africa, often aligning itself with regimes that Russia seeks to support.

00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:31.639
In Syria, Wagner fought alongside forces loyal to President

00:19:31.679 --> 00:19:36.069
Bashar al-Assad, securing oil fields and other strategic assets.

00:19:36.789 --> 00:19:42.689
In Africa, Wagner has operated in countries like Libya, Sudan, and the

00:19:42.689 --> 00:19:46.719
Central African Republic, providing security for unstable governments

00:19:46.999 --> 00:19:51.589
in exchange for access to valuable resources such as gold and diamonds.

00:19:52.619 --> 00:19:57.859
And while Wagner’s fighters are technically “private contractors,”  their

00:19:57.859 --> 00:20:02.719
close ties to the Kremlin make them much more than just a mercenary force.

00:20:03.839 --> 00:20:08.399
They function as a tool of Russian foreign policy, extending Moscow’s

00:20:08.439 --> 00:20:12.569
influence in regions where it has strategic or economic interests.

00:20:13.609 --> 00:20:19.359
This dual role—as both a profit-driven organisation and a geopolitical

00:20:19.409 --> 00:20:23.853
instrument—sets Wagner apart from other PMCs like Blackwater.

00:20:24.354 --> 00:20:26.774
But it is not the only difference.

00:20:27.314 --> 00:20:34.214
The level of violence Wagner seems prepared to use puts it in another category altogether.

00:20:34.744 --> 00:20:39.364
Yes, Blackwater contractors clearly did awful things in Iraq,

00:20:39.634 --> 00:20:44.654
but the ongoing conduct of Wagner soldiers is in another league.

00:20:45.434 --> 00:20:48.864
The group has been accused of committing war crimes, including

00:20:49.084 --> 00:20:53.144
targeting civilians, extrajudicial killings, and torture.

00:20:54.324 --> 00:20:59.024
One of the most infamous incidents involves a video of Wagner

00:20:59.064 --> 00:21:04.674
operatives allegedly using a sledgehammer to execute a Syrian prisoner.

00:21:05.434 --> 00:21:07.484
It is grim stuff, indeed.

00:21:08.204 --> 00:21:13.464
And while it might have been more distant, at an arm’s length from the

00:21:13.464 --> 00:21:19.394
Russian state, Wagner is reportedly now even more closely tied to the Kremlin.

00:21:20.554 --> 00:21:25.584
As you may remember, in June 2023, the leader of the Wagner Group,

00:21:25.834 --> 00:21:30.274
Yevgeny Prigozhin, launched a rebellion and marched towards Moscow,

00:21:30.664 --> 00:21:35.244
before backing down and apparently solving his issues with Putin.

00:21:36.294 --> 00:21:41.194
Clearly, these issues were not solved, as Prigozhin died in a plane crash a

00:21:41.194 --> 00:21:46.074
few months later, and what this has meant, according to many Russia watchers,

00:21:46.464 --> 00:21:51.744
is that Wagner has more closely integrated with the regular Russian forces.

00:21:52.414 --> 00:21:56.314
They are still in Ukraine, they are still in Africa, they are still in the

00:21:56.314 --> 00:22:03.614
Middle East, and still often operate in this grey zone: part Private Military

00:22:03.614 --> 00:22:10.044
Company, part state actor, and able to shift between the two when the need arises.

00:22:11.874 --> 00:22:16.964
Now, to wrap things up, from Renaissance Italy to modern paramilitaries,

00:22:17.104 --> 00:22:21.854
one thing is clear: the idea of soldiers for hire is anything but new.

00:22:22.484 --> 00:22:27.574
Money, as they say, talks—and it speaks loudly on the battlefield.

00:22:28.139 --> 00:22:34.029
Renaissance condottieri, corporate PMCs, and modern-day groups like Wagner all

00:22:34.029 --> 00:22:40.169
show us different faces of the same truth: war, for some, is just another business.

00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:45.415
As long as there is money to be made, there will always be someone willing to fight.

00:22:47.138 --> 00:22:51.074
OK then, that is it for today's episode on mercenaries.

00:22:51.354 --> 00:22:54.484
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:22:58.324 --> 00:23:03.194
Are there any linguistic influences from the world of mercenaries that have entered your language?

00:23:03.514 --> 00:23:06.764
How do you think mercenaries should be treated in the eyes of the law?

00:23:07.274 --> 00:23:10.624
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.
