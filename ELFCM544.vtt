Hello, hello, hello, and welcome

00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:09.729
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.729 --> 00:00:12.439
Minds, by Leonardo English, the show

00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:14.129
where you can listen to fascinating

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:16.569
stories and learn weird and wonderful

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:18.529
things about the world at the same

00:00:18.549 --> 00:00:20.319
time as improving your English.

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:23.619
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are

00:00:23.629 --> 00:00:25.739
going to be talking about a church.

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:29.119
But this is no normal church.

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.529
Its name is the Westboro Baptist Church,

00:00:32.819 --> 00:00:35.959
and the not-normally-sensational BBC

00:00:36.294 --> 00:00:38.984
decided its members deserved the title

00:00:39.114 --> 00:00:42.294
of “The Most Hated Family in America”.

00:00:42.754 --> 00:00:45.364
So, in today’s episode, we’ll tell the

00:00:45.364 --> 00:00:48.284
story about where it came from, why it is

00:00:48.284 --> 00:00:51.264
so controversial and almost universally

00:00:51.304 --> 00:00:54.624
reviled, and learn about how some, but

00:00:54.624 --> 00:00:57.154
not all, of its members saw the light.

00:00:57.704 --> 00:00:59.934
I should add, as a little disclaimer,

00:01:00.214 --> 00:01:01.944
that the reason this church is so

00:01:01.984 --> 00:01:04.173
controversial is because it holds

00:01:04.203 --> 00:01:06.203
some deeply offensive beliefs,

00:01:06.303 --> 00:01:08.433
about homosexuality in particular.

00:01:08.823 --> 00:01:11.693
And while I hope it is obvious that these

00:01:11.713 --> 00:01:14.973
are beliefs that I also find abhorrent and

00:01:14.973 --> 00:01:17.463
in no way endorse, I wanted to give you

00:01:17.463 --> 00:01:19.583
that little warning before we get into it.

00:01:20.283 --> 00:01:22.454
OK then, let’s get started.

00:01:23.574 --> 00:01:25.024
There is a brilliant British

00:01:25.024 --> 00:01:26.844
journalist you might have heard

00:01:26.844 --> 00:01:28.994
about called Louis Theroux.

00:01:29.624 --> 00:01:32.104
He became something of a household

00:01:32.104 --> 00:01:34.944
name in the late 1990s, after

00:01:34.944 --> 00:01:37.334
making a documentary series called

00:01:37.424 --> 00:01:39.744
“Louis Theroux's Weird Weekends”.

00:01:40.394 --> 00:01:43.184
The premise was a simple one: he would

00:01:43.194 --> 00:01:45.564
go and spend time with a group of people

00:01:45.574 --> 00:01:48.674
with unusual beliefs or hobbies, people

00:01:48.854 --> 00:01:51.684
who existed on the fringes of society.

00:01:52.604 --> 00:01:56.284
The first episode was with TV evangelists,

00:01:56.384 --> 00:01:58.684
born again, evangelical Christians,

00:01:59.034 --> 00:02:00.754
and then he went on to visit people

00:02:00.924 --> 00:02:03.574
who believed in UFOs, people working

00:02:03.774 --> 00:02:06.424
in the porn industry, survivalists,

00:02:06.544 --> 00:02:09.194
wrestlers, black nationalists, white

00:02:09.194 --> 00:02:11.834
nationalists, body builders, and so on.

00:02:13.114 --> 00:02:15.474
They were extremely popular from

00:02:15.484 --> 00:02:18.684
the get-go, and Theroux became known

00:02:18.684 --> 00:02:21.564
for his soft, non-judgmental style.

00:02:22.147 --> 00:02:24.951
He was there as an observer, and

00:02:25.101 --> 00:02:27.161
he had a particular knack for

00:02:27.161 --> 00:02:28.791
making people feel comfortable.

00:02:29.521 --> 00:02:31.871
He wasn’t there to judge, no matter

00:02:31.871 --> 00:02:34.701
how odd or disagreeable someone’s

00:02:34.711 --> 00:02:36.641
opinion was; he wasn’t there to tell

00:02:36.641 --> 00:02:38.671
someone that they were wrong or that

00:02:38.671 --> 00:02:40.731
they shouldn’t do something; he had a

00:02:40.751 --> 00:02:43.161
particular empathy that was rare with

00:02:43.161 --> 00:02:45.771
interviewers, and is still rare today.

00:02:46.571 --> 00:02:48.331
He would spend time with drug

00:02:48.361 --> 00:02:50.741
addicts who were clearly on a road to

00:02:50.741 --> 00:02:53.437
self-destruction; he spent time with Jimmy

00:02:53.437 --> 00:02:56.727
Saville, a man who would later be outed as

00:02:56.727 --> 00:02:59.147
one of the UK’s most vicious paedophiles.

00:03:00.247 --> 00:03:03.227
He spent time with neo-Nazis, fraudsters,

00:03:03.477 --> 00:03:05.727
Westerners getting married to very young

00:03:05.787 --> 00:03:08.397
Thai girls, and through all of this

00:03:08.587 --> 00:03:11.157
he attempted to shine a light into the

00:03:11.207 --> 00:03:13.437
personal lives of these individuals.

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:17.981
And in 2007, he released an episode

00:03:18.221 --> 00:03:20.131
about the week he had spent with

00:03:20.131 --> 00:03:22.291
the Westboro Baptist Church.

00:03:23.031 --> 00:03:25.411
The name given to the episode was

00:03:25.481 --> 00:03:27.981
“The Most Hated Family in America”.

00:03:28.601 --> 00:03:30.931
It might sound like an extreme thing

00:03:30.931 --> 00:03:33.381
to say, especially coming from a

00:03:33.391 --> 00:03:35.241
mild-mannered Englishman working for

00:03:35.241 --> 00:03:39.051
the BBC, but it was hard to dispute.

00:03:39.861 --> 00:03:42.211
At that time, the members of the

00:03:42.211 --> 00:03:45.211
church, the Phelps family, spent

00:03:45.251 --> 00:03:48.151
their days protesting at the funerals

00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:50.021
of American soldiers who had been

00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:52.694
killed in Iraq and Afghanistan.

00:03:53.894 --> 00:03:56.904
This was not an anti-war protest;

00:03:57.044 --> 00:03:58.664
they weren’t protesting against the

00:03:58.664 --> 00:04:00.634
government’s decision to send American

00:04:00.634 --> 00:04:02.574
troops to war, they weren’t protesting

00:04:02.774 --> 00:04:04.474
against the individual soldiers who

00:04:04.474 --> 00:04:07.174
were fighting, or at least not directly.

00:04:07.934 --> 00:04:09.964
They would stand by the side of the

00:04:09.964 --> 00:04:12.194
road opposite where the funerals

00:04:12.194 --> 00:04:14.414
were taking place, and hold up

00:04:14.414 --> 00:04:17.504
signs saying things like “God hates

00:04:17.504 --> 00:04:20.781
America”, “ America is doomed”, or

00:04:21.021 --> 00:04:24.371
most famously, “God hates fags”.

00:04:24.891 --> 00:04:27.841
A fag is a derogratory term in

00:04:27.871 --> 00:04:30.261
American English for a gay person.

00:04:31.121 --> 00:04:34.071
And as a linguistic side note, and

00:04:34.251 --> 00:04:36.551
cross-cultural curiousity, if you

00:04:36.551 --> 00:04:39.491
say “fag” in British English, it is

00:04:39.491 --> 00:04:41.331
slang for something very different.

00:04:41.591 --> 00:04:42.981
It means cigarette.

00:04:43.791 --> 00:04:46.171
But the Westboro Baptist Church

00:04:46.361 --> 00:04:49.061
was not on an anti-smoking crusade.

00:04:49.561 --> 00:04:52.191
According to the Westboro Baptist Church,

00:04:52.581 --> 00:04:54.731
American soldiers were being killed

00:04:54.751 --> 00:04:57.711
in Iraq as a punishment for America’s

00:04:57.721 --> 00:05:00.981
liberal attitude, and society’s growing

00:05:01.011 --> 00:05:03.271
tolerance towards homosexuality.

00:05:04.241 --> 00:05:06.521
So the reaction of the Westboro

00:05:06.531 --> 00:05:09.031
Baptist Church, doing what it claimed

00:05:09.041 --> 00:05:11.661
was “the Lord’s work”, was to stand

00:05:11.851 --> 00:05:14.021
outside the funerals of dead soldiers

00:05:14.191 --> 00:05:16.291
with these deeply offensive signs,

00:05:16.621 --> 00:05:19.361
singing songs and rejoicing in the

00:05:19.381 --> 00:05:21.461
deaths of their fellow Americans.

00:05:22.221 --> 00:05:25.121
They “rejoiced” because in their minds

00:05:25.331 --> 00:05:27.771
and according to their interpretation

00:05:28.011 --> 00:05:31.071
of the Bible, this was an act of God,

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.127
and “everything God does is good”.

00:05:34.867 --> 00:05:36.887
Now, we are not going to get into any

00:05:36.927 --> 00:05:39.457
theological discussions here, and I

00:05:39.457 --> 00:05:41.647
should add that this interpretation

00:05:41.647 --> 00:05:43.467
of the Bible has been soundly

00:05:43.467 --> 00:05:45.894
rejected by every other church as

00:05:45.944 --> 00:05:48.804
incorrect, and as a deeply offensive

00:05:48.934 --> 00:05:50.854
misinterpretation of the scriptures.

00:05:51.584 --> 00:05:54.854
And as you might imagine, the presence of

00:05:54.854 --> 00:05:57.174
the Westboro Baptist Church outside these

00:05:57.184 --> 00:05:59.974
funerals, as families were trying to mourn

00:05:59.994 --> 00:06:02.704
their loved ones, was never appreciated.

00:06:03.414 --> 00:06:05.564
People would roll down their car

00:06:05.564 --> 00:06:07.814
windows and hurl abuse at them,

00:06:08.394 --> 00:06:10.364
passers-by would stop to confront

00:06:10.364 --> 00:06:13.314
them, and those wanting to do things

00:06:13.314 --> 00:06:15.574
by the letter of the law might file

00:06:15.584 --> 00:06:18.294
claims against them or attempt to stop

00:06:18.344 --> 00:06:20.264
them from coming close to a funeral.

00:06:21.464 --> 00:06:24.171
As a result, the members of this church,

00:06:24.441 --> 00:06:26.691
which really consists of one extended

00:06:26.691 --> 00:06:29.811
family and a few stragglers, a few hangers

00:06:29.811 --> 00:06:33.201
on, were almost universally loathed.

00:06:33.791 --> 00:06:35.891
It’s not hard to understand why Louis

00:06:35.891 --> 00:06:38.061
Theroux thought they deserved the title

00:06:38.294 --> 00:06:40.581
of “the most hated family in America”.

00:06:41.071 --> 00:06:43.671
Or as the Southern Poverty Law Center

00:06:43.671 --> 00:06:46.751
put it "arguably the most obnoxious

00:06:46.791 --> 00:06:49.121
and rabid hate group in America".

00:06:50.071 --> 00:06:53.041
So, where did all of this hate come from?

00:06:53.621 --> 00:06:56.071
Well, at the centre of it all was this

00:06:56.101 --> 00:06:58.371
extended family, the Phelps family.

00:06:59.281 --> 00:07:01.541
The head of the family, a man called

00:07:01.551 --> 00:07:03.881
Fred Phelps, founded the Westboro

00:07:03.891 --> 00:07:07.311
Baptist Church in 1955, in Topeka,

00:07:07.431 --> 00:07:09.661
Kansas, in the American midwest.

00:07:10.991 --> 00:07:13.291
He was a civil rights lawyer by

00:07:13.321 --> 00:07:15.961
training, which might seem like an odd

00:07:16.141 --> 00:07:18.161
starting point for someone who would go

00:07:18.161 --> 00:07:20.221
on to form his own hate organisation.

00:07:20.981 --> 00:07:23.431
It is especially odd as he was a pretty

00:07:23.431 --> 00:07:25.581
successful and well-respected lawyer

00:07:25.861 --> 00:07:28.131
who received awards for his work against

00:07:28.131 --> 00:07:30.901
racial discrimination, that was, before he

00:07:30.901 --> 00:07:33.231
was disbarred, forbidden from practising

00:07:33.241 --> 00:07:35.321
law due to his offensive beliefs.

00:07:36.251 --> 00:07:39.687
And this belief really came down to one

00:07:39.687 --> 00:07:43.314
thing: a visceral hatred of gay people.

00:07:43.864 --> 00:07:45.574
The entire religious doctrine

00:07:45.574 --> 00:07:47.524
that he preached was all about the

00:07:47.544 --> 00:07:50.184
supposed “sin” of homosexuality.

00:07:51.074 --> 00:07:53.604
He would preach fiery sermons about

00:07:53.604 --> 00:07:55.334
how everyone was going to hell,

00:07:55.604 --> 00:07:58.194
not just gay people but anyone who

00:07:58.194 --> 00:08:00.484
didn’t recognise and protest the

00:08:00.734 --> 00:08:02.954
“homosexualisation” of America.

00:08:03.784 --> 00:08:06.404
Every death, every natural disaster,

00:08:06.624 --> 00:08:08.354
every bad thing that happened in the

00:08:08.354 --> 00:08:12.064
world was, in his view, God’s way

00:08:12.104 --> 00:08:14.194
of punishing the United States for

00:08:14.194 --> 00:08:16.704
its tolerance towards homosexuality.

00:08:17.934 --> 00:08:20.714
And, as is not uncommon in Southern

00:08:20.724 --> 00:08:23.304
Baptist churches, he frequently preached

00:08:23.424 --> 00:08:25.654
about Judgement Day, when Christ

00:08:25.794 --> 00:08:28.264
would come again and everyone who had

00:08:28.264 --> 00:08:30.554
ever lived would be judged by God.

00:08:31.614 --> 00:08:34.244
Those who had lived a good life would be

00:08:34.244 --> 00:08:37.474
saved, and those who hadn’t, well, they

00:08:37.474 --> 00:08:39.904
would be subjected to eternal damnation.

00:08:40.924 --> 00:08:44.214
And in Phelps's book, by his teachings,

00:08:44.464 --> 00:08:47.104
only a very select group would not

00:08:47.284 --> 00:08:49.344
be condemned to eternal damnation.

00:08:49.914 --> 00:08:51.234
Only he and his

00:08:51.234 --> 00:08:52.964
congregation, his followers.

00:08:54.074 --> 00:08:56.824
Now, when he first formed the church,

00:08:57.034 --> 00:08:59.404
it wasn’t quite so radical in its

00:08:59.404 --> 00:09:02.594
beliefs, but his fiery temper put

00:09:02.644 --> 00:09:05.264
regular churchgoers off, and his

00:09:05.264 --> 00:09:07.214
church was frequented essentially

00:09:07.254 --> 00:09:08.844
only by his family members.

00:09:10.054 --> 00:09:12.354
Fortunately, at least in terms of

00:09:12.364 --> 00:09:13.724
filling up all the seats in the

00:09:13.734 --> 00:09:16.934
church, he had a large family: 13

00:09:16.934 --> 00:09:20.184
children and around 50 grandchildren.

00:09:21.754 --> 00:09:24.804
These children grew up in this completely

00:09:24.904 --> 00:09:27.964
isolated environment of extreme hate.

00:09:28.644 --> 00:09:31.494
All they knew was the teachings of

00:09:31.494 --> 00:09:34.014
this powerful man, their father or

00:09:34.024 --> 00:09:36.664
grandfather, who drilled into them that

00:09:36.714 --> 00:09:39.184
everyone was going to hell and the only

00:09:39.184 --> 00:09:41.554
way to avoid this fate was by doing

00:09:41.814 --> 00:09:44.734
“the Lord’s work”, which in his mind

00:09:44.974 --> 00:09:47.064
was protesting things like funerals,

00:09:47.294 --> 00:09:48.974
going anywhere where they could to

00:09:48.974 --> 00:09:51.094
attract the curious eyes of the media.

00:09:52.384 --> 00:09:54.521
This started for good in the

00:09:54.521 --> 00:09:57.534
early 1990s and has continued,

00:09:57.974 --> 00:09:59.754
well, until the present day.

00:10:00.564 --> 00:10:03.094
More than 30 years of standing

00:10:03.094 --> 00:10:05.404
at funerals with offensive signs,

00:10:05.624 --> 00:10:08.224
rejoicing in the deaths of strangers.

00:10:09.594 --> 00:10:12.404
At first, their protests focused on

00:10:12.404 --> 00:10:14.814
events related to gay rights, claiming

00:10:14.814 --> 00:10:17.124
that natural disasters, terrorist

00:10:17.124 --> 00:10:20.154
attacks, and even diseases like AIDS

00:10:20.314 --> 00:10:22.794
were divine punishments for America’s

00:10:22.814 --> 00:10:25.334
growing tolerance of homosexuality.

00:10:26.324 --> 00:10:29.924
They gained particular notoriety in 1998

00:10:30.177 --> 00:10:32.514
for picketing the funeral of a young

00:10:32.524 --> 00:10:34.974
gay man called Matthew Shepard, who

00:10:34.974 --> 00:10:37.314
was brutally murdered in a hate crime.

00:10:38.164 --> 00:10:41.304
So while the family of this man, and

00:10:41.444 --> 00:10:43.324
the country at large, was coming to

00:10:43.324 --> 00:10:45.304
terms with the fact that this young

00:10:45.304 --> 00:10:47.844
man had been viciously killed for being

00:10:47.854 --> 00:10:50.514
gay, there was the Westboro Baptist

00:10:50.514 --> 00:10:52.914
Church standing outside his funeral

00:10:53.164 --> 00:10:55.674
cheering and celebrating his death.

00:10:56.564 --> 00:11:00.124
It is pretty horrible stuff indeed, but by

00:11:00.124 --> 00:11:03.624
the mid-2000s, their focus had expanded.

00:11:04.464 --> 00:11:06.314
They began protesting the funerals

00:11:06.534 --> 00:11:09.334
of American soldiers, claiming that

00:11:09.334 --> 00:11:12.204
their deaths in war were also God’s

00:11:12.204 --> 00:11:14.274
punishment for the country’s sins.

00:11:15.134 --> 00:11:17.644
This was what shocked so many people.

00:11:18.244 --> 00:11:20.584
Even in a country deeply divided

00:11:20.704 --> 00:11:22.794
on politics and religion, the

00:11:22.794 --> 00:11:25.154
idea of protesting at a soldier’s

00:11:25.164 --> 00:11:27.364
funeral was almost universally

00:11:27.364 --> 00:11:29.314
considered beyond the pale.

00:11:30.694 --> 00:11:33.254
And yet, for the Phelps family, it

00:11:33.254 --> 00:11:35.944
wasn’t just a protest—it was a mission.

00:11:36.644 --> 00:11:38.134
They weren’t trying to win support.

00:11:38.454 --> 00:11:39.784
They weren’t looking to

00:11:39.784 --> 00:11:41.234
persuade people to join them.

00:11:41.804 --> 00:11:44.434
In fact, they seemed to delight

00:11:44.614 --> 00:11:46.644
in how much people hated them.

00:11:47.924 --> 00:11:50.784
Because in their worldview, the

00:11:50.784 --> 00:11:53.294
fact that they were hated was proof

00:11:53.514 --> 00:11:55.294
that they were doing God’s work.

00:11:56.664 --> 00:11:59.474
Fred Phelps often quoted a passage from

00:11:59.474 --> 00:12:04.964
the Bible, John 15:18, where Jesus tells

00:12:04.964 --> 00:12:08.404
his disciples: If the world hates you, you

00:12:08.404 --> 00:12:11.454
know it has hated me before it hated you.

00:12:12.694 --> 00:12:15.574
Now, clearly, Fred Phelps was not the

00:12:15.574 --> 00:12:18.404
first nor will he be the last person to

00:12:18.404 --> 00:12:20.434
have taken a section of a religious text

00:12:20.734 --> 00:12:22.864
and interpreted it in a way that has

00:12:22.864 --> 00:12:25.214
legitimised a deeply offensive action.

00:12:26.104 --> 00:12:28.434
But it was this passage that he

00:12:28.444 --> 00:12:30.864
kept returning to that allowed

00:12:30.864 --> 00:12:33.121
him to explain to his family that

00:12:33.121 --> 00:12:35.084
what they were doing was right.

00:12:35.844 --> 00:12:37.854
To them, the fact that they were

00:12:37.854 --> 00:12:40.354
so reviled and attacked wasn’t

00:12:40.384 --> 00:12:42.084
evidence that they were wrong—it

00:12:42.084 --> 00:12:44.284
was proof that they were righteous.

00:12:45.324 --> 00:12:47.284
This mentality was what made

00:12:47.284 --> 00:12:48.784
them so difficult to deal with.

00:12:49.374 --> 00:12:51.684
They weren’t interested in discussion,

00:12:51.764 --> 00:12:53.774
they didn’t care about being hated,

00:12:54.254 --> 00:12:57.244
and if anything, they actively sought

00:12:57.264 --> 00:12:59.774
out ways to provoke as much outrage

00:12:59.774 --> 00:13:01.574
as possible, which was why they

00:13:01.574 --> 00:13:03.681
protested at high-profile events

00:13:03.851 --> 00:13:05.941
that they knew the media would be at.

00:13:07.021 --> 00:13:09.581
So when Louis Theroux arrived

00:13:09.671 --> 00:13:12.811
in 2007, he wasn’t just visiting

00:13:12.881 --> 00:13:14.311
a strange little church.

00:13:14.691 --> 00:13:17.291
He was stepping into a self-contained

00:13:17.291 --> 00:13:20.411
world, one where hatred was seen

00:13:20.431 --> 00:13:22.647
as a virtue, where children were

00:13:22.647 --> 00:13:24.347
raised to celebrate the suffering

00:13:24.347 --> 00:13:26.777
of others, and where outsiders

00:13:26.937 --> 00:13:29.117
were seen as agents of Satan.

00:13:30.157 --> 00:13:32.497
It made for pretty powerful viewing.

00:13:32.937 --> 00:13:35.147
It’s still available on a few streaming

00:13:35.147 --> 00:13:37.644
services, and it’s called “The Most

00:13:37.644 --> 00:13:39.694
Hated Family in America”, if you’re

00:13:39.704 --> 00:13:41.104
interested in watching it for yourself.

00:13:41.984 --> 00:13:44.014
There are some particularly difficult

00:13:44.014 --> 00:13:46.274
moments in the documentary where Louis

00:13:46.474 --> 00:13:49.624
talks to the children, some just 3 or 4

00:13:49.624 --> 00:13:52.664
years old, and others who were teenagers.

00:13:53.494 --> 00:13:55.894
With the younger kids, it was,

00:13:55.914 --> 00:13:58.214
of course, sad to see these tiny

00:13:58.214 --> 00:13:59.924
little things holding up these

00:13:59.934 --> 00:14:02.884
vile messages or repeating the same

00:14:02.924 --> 00:14:04.584
offensive lines as their parents,

00:14:04.924 --> 00:14:07.964
but you felt more sorrow than anger.

00:14:08.704 --> 00:14:11.184
After all, you can’t really be angry

00:14:11.354 --> 00:14:13.624
at a child that age; they don’t really

00:14:13.654 --> 00:14:15.594
understand what they’re saying, they know

00:14:15.594 --> 00:14:18.094
nothing else, and if they have grown up

00:14:18.114 --> 00:14:20.454
in that environment and that is what they

00:14:20.454 --> 00:14:22.404
have been told by everyone they have ever

00:14:22.414 --> 00:14:24.974
met, of course that’s what they will say.

00:14:25.934 --> 00:14:28.544
But more interesting and challenging

00:14:28.814 --> 00:14:30.854
were his interactions with the

00:14:30.904 --> 00:14:32.534
teenage girls of the family.

00:14:33.687 --> 00:14:36.197
These teenagers, particularly a

00:14:36.237 --> 00:14:38.547
pair of sisters called Megan and

00:14:38.557 --> 00:14:41.257
Grace Phelps-Roper, were articulate,

00:14:41.597 --> 00:14:44.181
intelligent, and—at least on the

00:14:44.181 --> 00:14:46.597
surface—utterly convinced of the

00:14:46.597 --> 00:14:48.341
beliefs they had been raised with.

00:14:49.581 --> 00:14:52.081
Unlike the younger children, who simply

00:14:52.211 --> 00:14:54.151
repeated what they'd been taught, the

00:14:54.151 --> 00:14:56.521
teenagers were old enough to debate.

00:14:57.331 --> 00:14:59.731
They quoted Bible verses, they had

00:14:59.731 --> 00:15:02.381
rehearsed arguments, and they firmly

00:15:02.381 --> 00:15:04.131
believed that what they were doing

00:15:04.271 --> 00:15:06.931
was an act of love—warning sinners

00:15:07.061 --> 00:15:08.991
before the Day of Judgment came.

00:15:10.161 --> 00:15:12.411
What was especially striking

00:15:12.791 --> 00:15:15.171
was how normal they seemed.

00:15:15.987 --> 00:15:18.071
In another life, they might have been

00:15:18.071 --> 00:15:20.411
the kind of bright, confident young

00:15:20.421 --> 00:15:22.851
women who excelled at school, played

00:15:22.851 --> 00:15:26.011
sports, or had wide social circles.

00:15:27.038 --> 00:15:29.654
Instead, they spent their time standing

00:15:29.664 --> 00:15:32.354
on street corners holding signs that

00:15:32.354 --> 00:15:35.314
provoked rage, disgust, and sometimes

00:15:35.334 --> 00:15:37.444
even violence from passers-by.

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:40.064
They talked about boys that they had

00:15:40.064 --> 00:15:42.104
struck up conversations with, that

00:15:42.384 --> 00:15:44.624
in another life might have become

00:15:44.844 --> 00:15:47.854
friends, perhaps even boyfriends, but

00:15:48.114 --> 00:15:50.754
instead quickly retreated to admitting

00:15:50.964 --> 00:15:53.254
that these boys would burn in hell,

00:15:53.654 --> 00:15:56.014
and that was actually a good thing

00:15:56.294 --> 00:15:58.394
because this was the will of God.

00:15:58.994 --> 00:16:01.044
And yet, despite their apparent

00:16:01.094 --> 00:16:03.184
confidence in front of the cameras,

00:16:03.454 --> 00:16:05.914
it seemed that somewhere beneath the

00:16:05.914 --> 00:16:08.174
surface, there were seeds of doubt.

00:16:09.234 --> 00:16:11.614
At one point in the documentary, Louis

00:16:11.614 --> 00:16:13.659
Theroux asks one of the teenagers,

00:16:13.939 --> 00:16:16.729
Megan, if she ever wonders what life

00:16:16.879 --> 00:16:18.939
outside the church might be like.

00:16:20.069 --> 00:16:23.059
She hesitates for a moment, then smiles

00:16:23.059 --> 00:16:25.379
back at him and insists that she is

00:16:25.379 --> 00:16:27.379
completely committed to her faith.

00:16:28.749 --> 00:16:31.489
But it seems that that hesitation

00:16:31.499 --> 00:16:33.969
was real, or at least was the sign of

00:16:33.969 --> 00:16:36.049
a little seed that was germinating.

00:16:36.679 --> 00:16:39.119
Perhaps that seed might have been planted

00:16:39.329 --> 00:16:41.479
right there and then by Louis Theroux.

00:16:42.569 --> 00:16:46.419
For just a few years later, these two

00:16:46.459 --> 00:16:49.319
articulate sisters, Megan and Grace

00:16:49.329 --> 00:16:51.719
Phelps-Roper, the ones who had so

00:16:51.739 --> 00:16:54.269
vigorously defended the doctrine of

00:16:54.269 --> 00:16:56.919
the Westboro Baptist Church, left.

00:16:58.259 --> 00:17:00.569
Now, like any cult, leaving the

00:17:00.569 --> 00:17:02.509
Westboro Baptist Church was not just

00:17:02.509 --> 00:17:04.209
a matter of walking out the door and

00:17:04.209 --> 00:17:06.579
saying, “Thanks, that was fun, but

00:17:06.769 --> 00:17:08.429
I’ve decided it’s not for me anymore”.

00:17:09.219 --> 00:17:11.479
For those born into it, as these two

00:17:11.479 --> 00:17:14.469
were, the church was their entire world.

00:17:14.929 --> 00:17:17.379
It wasn’t just their place of worship—it

00:17:17.379 --> 00:17:19.259
was their home, their school, their

00:17:19.399 --> 00:17:21.099
social life, and their family.

00:17:21.779 --> 00:17:23.829
These girls’ grandfather was the

00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:26.199
grand patriarch, Fred Phelps, the

00:17:26.199 --> 00:17:29.049
man who had started it all, and their

00:17:29.059 --> 00:17:31.619
mother had taken over his duties as

00:17:31.619 --> 00:17:33.469
the day-to-day head of the church.

00:17:34.119 --> 00:17:35.879
These girls weren’t just leaving

00:17:35.879 --> 00:17:37.269
a church; they were cutting

00:17:37.269 --> 00:17:39.139
themselves off from everything

00:17:39.359 --> 00:17:41.929
and everyone they had ever known.

00:17:43.339 --> 00:17:45.877
In the case of Megan Phelps-Roper,

00:17:45.877 --> 00:17:48.269
her “transformation” had taken place

00:17:48.479 --> 00:17:50.109
over the course of several years.

00:17:51.159 --> 00:17:53.289
She later did a TED talk about it,

00:17:53.569 --> 00:17:56.089
but long story short, she was in

00:17:56.089 --> 00:17:58.019
charge of the church’s social media

00:17:58.019 --> 00:17:59.799
accounts, from which she would

00:17:59.799 --> 00:18:02.069
normally viciously attack its critics.

00:18:02.939 --> 00:18:06.559
After a while, however, people started to

00:18:06.559 --> 00:18:09.309
engage with her on a more friendly level.

00:18:09.989 --> 00:18:12.159
Strangers on the internet started

00:18:12.159 --> 00:18:14.579
to point out inconsistencies in her

00:18:14.579 --> 00:18:16.494
argument, all while treating her

00:18:16.724 --> 00:18:18.024
with a respect that she had thought

00:18:18.054 --> 00:18:20.124
non-believers were incapable of.

00:18:20.964 --> 00:18:23.254
Fast forward a few years, and she

00:18:23.254 --> 00:18:25.574
came to the conclusion that perhaps

00:18:25.754 --> 00:18:27.954
the rest of the world wasn’t evil

00:18:28.254 --> 00:18:31.054
and wasn’t going to burn in hell, and

00:18:31.444 --> 00:18:34.574
in 2012, she left the church behind.

00:18:35.884 --> 00:18:38.244
Since then, she has gone on to become

00:18:38.244 --> 00:18:40.294
a vocal critic of it, as well as

00:18:40.304 --> 00:18:42.344
offered her unique perspective of

00:18:42.344 --> 00:18:44.864
what life was actually like as part

00:18:44.914 --> 00:18:46.794
of the most hated family in America.

00:18:48.164 --> 00:18:49.824
And what has happened to the

00:18:49.834 --> 00:18:51.924
church since then, you might ask?

00:18:52.574 --> 00:18:55.514
Well, the founder, patriarch and cult

00:18:55.534 --> 00:18:59.684
leader, Fred Phelps, died in 2014.

00:19:00.874 --> 00:19:03.384
When his death was announced, cars

00:19:03.394 --> 00:19:04.694
drove around the neighbourhood

00:19:04.944 --> 00:19:06.854
honking their horns in celebration.

00:19:07.464 --> 00:19:09.804
This man who had been a scourge,

00:19:09.804 --> 00:19:12.024
a black mark, on the city of

00:19:12.024 --> 00:19:14.246
Topeka was finally no more.

00:19:14.934 --> 00:19:18.014
The tables had turned, and now it was

00:19:18.024 --> 00:19:20.104
his death that was being celebrated.

00:19:21.444 --> 00:19:23.534
But, according to some reports,

00:19:23.784 --> 00:19:26.074
he may even have had a change of

00:19:26.074 --> 00:19:28.014
heart towards the end of his life.

00:19:28.954 --> 00:19:31.814
In 2013—just a year before he

00:19:31.814 --> 00:19:34.944
died—Phelps was seen expressing support

00:19:35.114 --> 00:19:37.204
for a more compassionate approach.

00:19:37.784 --> 00:19:40.664
Perhaps being gay wasn’t the horrendous

00:19:40.664 --> 00:19:42.814
sin that he had spent his life claiming

00:19:42.814 --> 00:19:46.054
it was; perhaps, dare I say it, he

00:19:46.054 --> 00:19:48.164
might have had a tinge of regret for

00:19:48.164 --> 00:19:51.024
all the hate and anguish he had caused.

00:19:52.104 --> 00:19:54.944
Even if this was the case, he had clearly

00:19:54.944 --> 00:19:57.564
done enough indoctrination of his kids and

00:19:57.574 --> 00:20:00.684
grandkids that they were firmly committed

00:20:00.884 --> 00:20:02.764
to the church’s extreme doctrine.

00:20:04.024 --> 00:20:05.784
Some former members have come

00:20:05.784 --> 00:20:07.704
forward to say that in the last

00:20:07.704 --> 00:20:10.074
few years of his life, Fred Phelps

00:20:10.234 --> 00:20:12.554
was actually excommunicated by

00:20:12.554 --> 00:20:14.724
his own family for showing too

00:20:14.724 --> 00:20:16.884
much sympathy towards outsiders.

00:20:17.744 --> 00:20:19.674
Now, this is not necessarily to

00:20:19.674 --> 00:20:21.644
say that he is deserving of great

00:20:21.654 --> 00:20:23.844
amounts of sympathy, having spent

00:20:23.854 --> 00:20:26.854
60 years spewing hatred, but perhaps

00:20:26.994 --> 00:20:29.014
it is indicative that even the most

00:20:29.084 --> 00:20:31.424
ardent of beliefs can be changed.

00:20:32.424 --> 00:20:35.190
And Megan and Grace Phelps-Roper

00:20:35.287 --> 00:20:36.954
weren’t the only ones who left.

00:20:37.424 --> 00:20:39.704
Over the years, dozens of other members

00:20:39.814 --> 00:20:42.324
have also escaped and given outsiders

00:20:42.344 --> 00:20:45.314
a peek into the day-to-day goings-on of

00:20:45.314 --> 00:20:47.474
this extremely offensive organisation.

00:20:48.654 --> 00:20:50.864
However, despite losing a bunch

00:20:50.864 --> 00:20:52.534
of its members, the Westboro

00:20:52.544 --> 00:20:54.924
Baptist Church still exists today.

00:20:55.654 --> 00:20:58.264
It remains a small, isolated group,

00:20:58.544 --> 00:21:00.444
still holding up offensive signs,

00:21:00.604 --> 00:21:02.744
still protesting funerals, still

00:21:02.964 --> 00:21:05.164
making headlines from time to time.

00:21:05.944 --> 00:21:08.474
But its influence has faded.

00:21:09.414 --> 00:21:12.064
Where once it shocked and outraged,

00:21:12.254 --> 00:21:15.304
now it is often dismissed as a sad

00:21:15.344 --> 00:21:18.514
relic of a hateful past—a fringe group

00:21:18.754 --> 00:21:21.764
clinging to extremism, and just updating

00:21:21.764 --> 00:21:23.864
its signs to claim that whatever is

00:21:23.864 --> 00:21:26.514
the latest natural disaster or global

00:21:26.524 --> 00:21:29.384
threat, from hurricanes to the COVID-19

00:21:29.404 --> 00:21:32.244
pandemic, that this is the will of God.

00:21:33.544 --> 00:21:35.934
The patriarch and man who started

00:21:35.944 --> 00:21:39.144
it all might be long gone, but even

00:21:39.144 --> 00:21:41.308
without him, his descendants, could

00:21:41.308 --> 00:21:43.774
still make a strong claim for the title

00:21:43.924 --> 00:21:46.384
of “the most hated family in America”.

00:21:47.994 --> 00:21:50.244
OK then, that is it for today's

00:21:50.244 --> 00:21:52.594
episode on the Westboro Baptist Church.

00:21:52.964 --> 00:21:54.254
As always, I would love to know

00:21:54.254 --> 00:21:55.484
what you thought about this episode.

00:21:55.914 --> 00:21:57.134
Have you heard of the

00:21:57.144 --> 00:21:58.324
Westboro Baptist Church?

00:21:58.514 --> 00:21:59.804
Have you seen the Louis Theroux

00:21:59.804 --> 00:22:01.394
documentary on it, or any

00:22:01.394 --> 00:22:02.614
of the other documentaries?

00:22:02.934 --> 00:22:03.994
Are there any organisations

00:22:04.034 --> 00:22:05.594
like this in your country?

00:22:06.064 --> 00:22:07.754
I would love to know, so let’s

00:22:07.754 --> 00:22:09.164
get this discussion started.

00:22:09.444 --> 00:22:10.524

00:22:10.524 --> 00:22:12.244
