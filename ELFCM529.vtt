Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.579
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories and learn weird and

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.820
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.379 --> 00:00:27.290
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about the up-and-down relationship

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:33.250
between two of the most powerful men in the world: Rupert Murdoch and Donald Trump.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.459
One is the owner of a sprawling media empire, controlling TV

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.480
networks, newspapers and publishing houses all over the world.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.180
The other is a man he helped put in the White House, Donald Trump.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:54.429
That was back in 2016, but since then, the relationship has soured,

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:59.309
with multiple fallings-out, billion-dollar lawsuits, attempts to prevent

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.199
Trump from winning re-election, family dynastic squabbles, and more.

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:08.669
So, let’s not waste a minute and learn about one of the

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.360
most important relationships in recent media history.

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:18.519
No doubt you will be familiar with the US electoral system, the

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.523
way in which citizens of the United States choose a president.

00:01:23.472 --> 00:01:27.700
Eligible voters cast their ballots before or on the

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.919
first Tuesday after the first Monday of November.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.849
Last year, that Tuesday was the 5th of November.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:42.250
Each state has a certain number of electoral college votes, the candidate who wins

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.419
the most votes wins the state, and–with the two exceptions of Maine and Nebraska–the

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.690
most popular candidate collects all of the electoral college votes in that state.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:03.119
And the candidate who wins more than 270 of the 538 electoral votes becomes president.

00:02:03.952 --> 00:02:12.312
On the evening of election day, there is a mad rush as states are “called” for certain candidates.

00:02:13.212 --> 00:02:19.582
News networks have those elaborate graphics showing states turning red or blue, with

00:02:19.592 --> 00:02:26.802
candidates seemingly racing towards that 270-vote finishing line, one creeping ahead before

00:02:26.802 --> 00:02:32.212
being overtaken by the other, then creeping back up again as they win another key state.

00:02:33.502 --> 00:02:40.932
Importantly though, this “calling” is not part of the official electoral process.

00:02:41.416 --> 00:02:46.846
It is done by the news networks, which rely on data from sources like the

00:02:46.856 --> 00:02:53.086
Associated Press, exit poll data, information on early voting trends, and so on.

00:02:54.086 --> 00:03:00.336
When a news network thinks that it has enough data to comfortably say that the

00:03:00.336 --> 00:03:06.386
Democratic or Republican candidate will win the state, they “call” it for that state.

00:03:07.476 --> 00:03:10.416
Clearly, they have a lot of experience doing this.

00:03:10.536 --> 00:03:14.246
There are large teams of data scientists and political analysts

00:03:14.476 --> 00:03:19.336
constantly adjusting their models, so they are almost always right.

00:03:20.226 --> 00:03:24.126
They don’t want to be wrong because that would be a major loss of credibility,

00:03:24.506 --> 00:03:31.606
but each network also wants to be first, so it is a constant battle between having

00:03:31.616 --> 00:03:37.526
enough data to make a correct decision and making a fast enough decision so that

00:03:37.536 --> 00:03:42.436
you keep viewers glued to the screen to get the most up-to-date information.

00:03:43.836 --> 00:03:47.946
The states that are traditionally Democrat or Republican

00:03:48.156 --> 00:03:51.846
tend to be called first, because it is obvious early on.

00:03:52.376 --> 00:04:00.302
But larger so-called “swing” states, places like Pennsylvania or Florida, take the longest

00:04:00.522 --> 00:04:06.852
because the result is often on a knife edge, both candidates are head to head, very close.

00:04:08.092 --> 00:04:15.012
And because these larger swing states carry a lot of electoral votes and are typically called

00:04:15.022 --> 00:04:22.562
last, one turning red or blue, voting for the Democratic or Republican candidate, can push that

00:04:22.592 --> 00:04:30.862
party over the 270 mark and result in the election being called for Republicans or Democrats.

00:04:31.552 --> 00:04:37.192
Now, importantly, this is only the news network calling it for the candidate, it isn’t

00:04:37.232 --> 00:04:44.352
legally binding, but when an important state, or even the election, is called by a

00:04:44.352 --> 00:04:50.012
news network, it takes the wind out of the sails of the other candidate; it can be

00:04:50.182 --> 00:04:56.382
seriously morale-boosting or campaign-destroying, depending on which way the call goes.

00:04:57.642 --> 00:05:02.812
And on the evening of the 2020 election, when Donald Trump

00:05:03.062 --> 00:05:08.462
was seeking re-election, one news network made a big call.

00:05:09.622 --> 00:05:15.612
At 11:20 pm, the traditionally Trump-loving Fox News was

00:05:15.612 --> 00:05:19.232
the first to call the state of Arizona for Joe Biden.

00:05:20.452 --> 00:05:22.702
It was a huge call.

00:05:23.582 --> 00:05:28.622
Only 73% of the votes had been counted, and Arizona

00:05:28.832 --> 00:05:33.786
had not voted for a Democratic candidate since 1996.

00:05:34.652 --> 00:05:39.632
None of the other news networks had called it; Fox was the first.

00:05:40.737 --> 00:05:46.862
This call didn’t quite put Biden over the 270 votes required to be president,

00:05:47.252 --> 00:05:52.702
but it made the path for a Trump victory significantly more difficult.

00:05:53.752 --> 00:05:56.412
The Trump campaign was livid.

00:05:57.032 --> 00:06:02.582
This was the news channel that had been Donald Trump’s media outlet of choice during his

00:06:02.592 --> 00:06:08.822
four years in office and had played no small role in getting him elected in the first place.

00:06:09.412 --> 00:06:13.492
It had been a hugely successful relationship for both parties.

00:06:14.642 --> 00:06:19.252
Donald Trump was given practically unlimited airtime on Fox News,

00:06:19.682 --> 00:06:25.052
and he was almost guaranteed favourable coverage by Fox News anchors.

00:06:26.072 --> 00:06:30.932
And in return, Fox News had made a fortune.

00:06:31.852 --> 00:06:36.332
The more Donald Trump coverage it showed, the more its viewers remained

00:06:36.342 --> 00:06:41.692
glued to the screen and the more advertising dollars it made as a result.

00:06:42.872 --> 00:06:48.042
And now it was, apparently, turning its back on Donald Trump.

00:06:49.162 --> 00:06:51.212
Where did this decision come from?

00:06:52.412 --> 00:06:58.602
Well, according to a book by the journalist Michael Wolff, it may well have come directly from

00:06:58.602 --> 00:07:05.692
the top, from Rupert Murdoch, the then 89-year-old media billionaire who controlled Fox News.

00:07:07.252 --> 00:07:12.552
Now, the story of Rupert Murdoch is as fascinating as it is long and

00:07:12.592 --> 00:07:17.802
complicated, but to give you a brief summary, after his father’s death,

00:07:18.092 --> 00:07:23.542
when Murdoch was only 21, he inherited a small Australian newspaper.

00:07:24.752 --> 00:07:31.812
This was back in 1952, and over the course of the next 70 years, he turned

00:07:31.812 --> 00:07:37.172
this into a media empire spanning large parts of the English-speaking world.

00:07:38.462 --> 00:07:43.342
This includes newspapers like The Times, The Sun, the Wall Street

00:07:43.362 --> 00:07:47.242
Journal and the New York Post, as well as HarperCollins Publishing.

00:07:47.892 --> 00:07:54.752
For a while, he also owned 20th Century Fox, the movie studio, which was then sold to Disney.

00:07:55.742 --> 00:08:01.932
But the jewel in the crown is Fox, the conservative-leaning news network,

00:08:02.242 --> 00:08:07.352
with properties like Fox News, Fox Business, Fox Sports, and so on.

00:08:08.752 --> 00:08:15.152
To state the obvious, this turned Murdoch into a fabulously wealthy man, worth

00:08:15.182 --> 00:08:22.292
a reported $22 billion, but more than this, it gave him great political power.

00:08:23.362 --> 00:08:29.012
Hundreds of millions of people across the world turned to his newspapers and TV shows for

00:08:29.012 --> 00:08:36.342
their news, and the opinions of his publications could make or break a political candidate.

00:08:37.542 --> 00:08:43.313
And there he was, or rather, there Fox News was, coming out before all of

00:08:43.313 --> 00:08:49.383
the left-leaning media outlets and calling a vital swing state for Joe Biden.

00:08:50.128 --> 00:08:55.718
It seemed…unusual, and it caught the Trump campaign off guard;

00:08:56.038 --> 00:09:00.012
they were surprised by what they interpreted as treachery.

00:09:01.348 --> 00:09:06.887
In fact, according to Michael Wolff, in his book about the last days of the Murdoch

00:09:07.017 --> 00:09:14.097
empire, this was not some last-minute flippant change of heart; it was a conscious

00:09:14.097 --> 00:09:20.447
decision aimed at restoring faith and trust in Fox’s journalistic integrity.

00:09:21.917 --> 00:09:29.767
For four years, Fox News had pledged unwavering support to Donald Trump, and when it seemed

00:09:29.797 --> 00:09:36.707
like the tide might be turning, that Trump might not be re-elected, this was simply a pragmatic

00:09:36.707 --> 00:09:43.127
decision by the owner of Fox News to not be seen purely as a Trumpian propaganda outlet.

00:09:44.687 --> 00:09:49.897
Indeed, right from the beginning of its support of Donald Trump, the marriage had always

00:09:49.897 --> 00:09:56.417
been one of mutual convenience; it was a commercial rather than an ideological alliance.

00:09:57.417 --> 00:10:03.797
Rupert Murdoch, the owner of Fox, had reportedly never liked Trump on a personal level.

00:10:04.737 --> 00:10:11.337
The two men outwardly claimed to be friends, but neither had much time for the other.

00:10:12.478 --> 00:10:16.438
Trump thought Murdoch was weird, and Murdoch thought

00:10:16.468 --> 00:10:20.578
Trump, according to Wolff at least, was “a fucking idiot”.

00:10:21.948 --> 00:10:25.958
He was, however, an incredibly profitable “idiot”.

00:10:26.878 --> 00:10:31.508
Fox News viewers fawned over Donald Trump, they couldn’t get enough of him.

00:10:32.118 --> 00:10:36.588
Starting in 2016 and continuing throughout his first

00:10:36.608 --> 00:10:40.438
presidency, Fox News became the Donald Trump show.

00:10:41.411 --> 00:10:46.981
Fox knew its audience incredibly well, and it knew that the more “red

00:10:46.991 --> 00:10:51.471
meat” it threw at them in the form of positive stories about Trump, or

00:10:51.681 --> 00:10:56.251
negative stories about his enemies, the higher ratings it would get.

00:10:57.481 --> 00:11:02.108
And in return, Trump gave Fox unparalleled access.

00:11:02.818 --> 00:11:09.888
The president often called in to discuss a new policy, to refute a new accusation, or just

00:11:09.888 --> 00:11:15.768
to chat with one of his favourite hosts: Sean Hannity, normally, but also Tucker Carlson.

00:11:16.498 --> 00:11:21.878
Importantly, Trump’s relationship with Fox News was not only with the network

00:11:21.878 --> 00:11:28.178
itself but also with its anchors, newsreaders, and Sean Hannity in particular.

00:11:29.398 --> 00:11:32.768
This Trump-Hannity relationship was unique.

00:11:33.338 --> 00:11:39.248
The two men had extensive private late-night conversations and public “phone-ins,”

00:11:39.418 --> 00:11:44.731
where Trump called in, and the conversation was broadcast live on Fox News.

00:11:45.631 --> 00:11:51.191
In an early one of these calls, when the COVID-19 pandemic was just starting

00:11:51.191 --> 00:11:56.531
to hit the United States, Trump proudly told Hannity that he had delayed a

00:11:56.531 --> 00:12:01.761
call with President Xi of China because he wanted to talk to Fox News first.

00:12:03.031 --> 00:12:09.511
With this apparent direct line to the president, Fox News anchors were rewarded

00:12:09.611 --> 00:12:17.464
handsomely, with Sean Hannity being paid a reported $36 million in 2018.

00:12:18.311 --> 00:12:23.541
But the amount that they brought in was many multiples greater than this.

00:12:24.231 --> 00:12:30.661
Fox News, with its typically older and more affluent audience, was a money-printing

00:12:30.671 --> 00:12:37.371
machine, and key to its success was the unusual relationship that it had with Donald Trump.

00:12:38.291 --> 00:12:42.361
But not everyone at Fox was happy with this.

00:12:43.201 --> 00:12:47.671
And it's here that we need to talk more about Rupert Murdoch, his

00:12:47.671 --> 00:12:52.721
family, the succession drama and the battle for control of Fox.

00:12:53.561 --> 00:12:58.491
Rupert Murdoch was 89 years old at the time of the 2020 election.

00:12:59.591 --> 00:13:04.481
Although he had begun to step back from some of the day-to-day operations of

00:13:04.481 --> 00:13:09.931
his empire, the question of who would succeed him, or to be precise, which of

00:13:09.931 --> 00:13:15.621
his children would take the reins, well, this was still very much unresolved.

00:13:16.471 --> 00:13:24.241
Murdoch has been married five times and has six children in total, but only three

00:13:24.251 --> 00:13:30.331
were in the running: his daughter, Elisabeth, and his two sons, Lachlan and James.

00:13:31.431 --> 00:13:37.701
Elisabeth had effectively rejected a future in the business, so the choice was between

00:13:37.701 --> 00:13:42.991
Lachlan and his younger brother, James, who were both in their late 40s at the time.

00:13:43.811 --> 00:13:48.171
The two brothers did not get on, and importantly for our

00:13:48.171 --> 00:13:52.831
story, had very different opinions about what to do with Fox.

00:13:54.041 --> 00:13:59.161
Lachlan had a similar view to his father, both in his conservative

00:13:59.211 --> 00:14:02.971
politics and his opinion on what should be done with the business.

00:14:03.781 --> 00:14:09.871
He was a pragmatist and recognised that Trump had been very good for business.

00:14:10.871 --> 00:14:16.521
He wasn’t blindly loyal to Trump, but he knew how much Fox had gained from the

00:14:16.521 --> 00:14:22.441
relationship and was wary of alienating its loyal audience, fearing that they would

00:14:22.451 --> 00:14:29.227
desert the network and go to smaller right-wing outlets like Newsmax and OANN if

00:14:29.417 --> 00:14:33.467
Fox wasn’t prepared to show the Trump-favourable coverage they were looking for.

00:14:34.777 --> 00:14:40.417
From Lachlan Murdoch’s perspective, Fox was a money-making machine; it had

00:14:40.417 --> 00:14:46.567
historically unparalleled access to a president, so why kill the golden goose?

00:14:48.287 --> 00:14:53.947
James, on the other hand, was more liberal in his political views and felt

00:14:54.007 --> 00:15:00.467
uncomfortable with what he felt was Fox’s inflammatory and polarising politics.

00:15:01.627 --> 00:15:07.647
He believed that he and his siblings, who were still significant shareholders in Fox,

00:15:08.157 --> 00:15:14.447
he believed that they had a moral obligation to turn Fox into a “force for good”.

00:15:15.397 --> 00:15:19.087
It didn’t mean becoming liberal or abandoning its

00:15:19.087 --> 00:15:24.207
conservative base, but it did mean moving away from Trump.

00:15:24.977 --> 00:15:30.217
Trump was unreliable, unpredictable, and disloyal, and

00:15:30.387 --> 00:15:34.037
he represented everything that James Murdoch hated.

00:15:35.277 --> 00:15:39.777
Ultimately, it seemed that Lachlan’s point of view, of maintaining the

00:15:39.777 --> 00:15:44.347
status quo, would prove victorious, as he became the executive chairman

00:15:44.347 --> 00:15:50.077
and CEO of Fox, and the designated successor to his father’s media empire.

00:15:50.978 --> 00:15:58.721
However, James and his siblings still have substantial ownership of Fox via a trust, so

00:15:59.114 --> 00:16:05.611
there was and still is this complicated situation in which some of the owners of Fox favour

00:16:05.641 --> 00:16:11.511
taking the company in one direction, away from its traditional Trump-supporting base, while

00:16:11.521 --> 00:16:17.301
the news desk and Lachlan prefer to stick with Trump because of quite how profitable he is.

00:16:18.411 --> 00:16:23.261
This was the background to that Arizona early call in 2020,

00:16:23.611 --> 00:16:27.401
which reportedly was authorised by Rupert Murdoch himself.

00:16:28.691 --> 00:16:35.061
And in the aftermath of this, and of the 2020 election, Trump was livid.

00:16:35.811 --> 00:16:41.541
He called in multiple times to express his displeasure at Fox News,

00:16:41.861 --> 00:16:46.871
and even claimed that Fox was getting into the “fake news” business.

00:16:47.721 --> 00:16:53.941
Now, even though the Arizona call for Biden was proved to be correct, Fox

00:16:53.991 --> 00:16:59.611
News viewers started criticising the network for “deserting” Trump and

00:16:59.901 --> 00:17:05.674
threatened to move over to other conservative channels like Newsmax or OANN.

00:17:06.131 --> 00:17:10.851
Was Fox News going to lose Donald Trump, the man who had made the anchors

00:17:10.881 --> 00:17:15.731
and the network’s owners spectacularly wealthy, and with it, would it

00:17:15.731 --> 00:17:19.361
lose the viewers who tuned in religiously to hear what he had to say?

00:17:20.191 --> 00:17:25.891
According to the Michael Wolff book, this created a big dilemma at Fox News,

00:17:26.061 --> 00:17:31.491
and his supporters at the network scrambled to figure out how to win him back.

00:17:32.991 --> 00:17:35.501
What could be done to appease Trump?

00:17:35.751 --> 00:17:38.711
What stories would Trump supporters want to hear?

00:17:39.921 --> 00:17:46.121
The story that Trump wanted to tell in the days after the election was that it had been

00:17:46.181 --> 00:17:53.632
“stolen”, that electronic voting machines had been “rigged”, manipulated to favour Joe Biden.

00:17:54.691 --> 00:18:00.361
And in the week after the election, as you might recall, various Fox News

00:18:00.381 --> 00:18:05.451
anchors repeated these claims of election interference, suggesting that

00:18:05.451 --> 00:18:11.381
voting machines had been tampered with to “steal” the election for Democrats.

00:18:12.561 --> 00:18:18.031
Now, on the Saturday after the election, the result was officially called for

00:18:18.031 --> 00:18:23.851
Joe Biden, his election was certified, and there is no evidence whatsoever

00:18:24.101 --> 00:18:28.511
that the election was “stolen” or that these voting machines were “rigged”.

00:18:29.311 --> 00:18:34.401
But this didn’t stop Fox News, which, in just two weeks after the

00:18:34.411 --> 00:18:41.501
election, questioned the election result a whopping 774 times.

00:18:43.271 --> 00:18:48.621
Donald Trump might have been somewhat pleased to hear this theory being repeated over and

00:18:48.621 --> 00:18:55.241
over on his favourite news network, but these claims would come back to haunt Fox News.

00:18:56.851 --> 00:19:02.491
A year and a half later, one of the manufacturers of the accused voting machines,

00:19:02.711 --> 00:19:10.621
Dominion, filed a lawsuit against Fox News for defamation, essentially the crime of making

00:19:10.631 --> 00:19:16.181
a knowingly false statement that damages the good name of a person or an organisation.

00:19:18.071 --> 00:19:22.281
And they were seeking more than just an apology.

00:19:23.151 --> 00:19:30.031
Lawyers for Dominion were asking for $1.6 billion in damages.

00:19:31.871 --> 00:19:36.996
The case dragged on for several years, and in April of 2023,

00:19:37.651 --> 00:19:46.201
Fox agreed to settle, paying a colossal $787 million in damages.

00:19:47.341 --> 00:19:53.741
There were, reportedly, other conditions, such as the cancellation of the contract of Fox’s

00:19:53.781 --> 00:20:00.441
top-ranked news anchor, Tucker Carlson, but these have been denied by both Fox and Dominion.

00:20:01.551 --> 00:20:08.281
In any case, despite the many hundreds of millions, perhaps even billions of dollars that Fox

00:20:08.281 --> 00:20:14.381
News made from its incredibly close relationship with Donald Trump, a sizable chunk of this

00:20:14.681 --> 00:20:20.541
was now to be handed over to Dominion as a price for airing the claims of election fraud.

00:20:21.791 --> 00:20:29.471
As part of the case, Dominion needed to prove that senior Fox News employees knew these claims of

00:20:29.481 --> 00:20:35.651
election fraud were bogus, that they weren’t true, but they still went ahead and published them.

00:20:36.801 --> 00:20:41.661
This was, according to Dominion, a calculated commercial move.

00:20:42.371 --> 00:20:48.291
Fox executives feared losing Donald Trump and the viewers who tuned in principally for

00:20:48.291 --> 00:20:54.161
news about him, so one way of rectifying the damage caused by the early election night

00:20:54.161 --> 00:21:00.441
call in Arizona was to give airtime to claims that they knew were very unlikely to be true.

00:21:01.941 --> 00:21:07.191
And while an attentive Fox News viewer might have sensed that something

00:21:07.201 --> 00:21:12.441
strange was going on, that there was an odd lack of continuity at Fox News,

00:21:12.811 --> 00:21:18.231
the Dominion lawsuit revealed the extent of the divisions behind the scenes.

00:21:19.141 --> 00:21:23.981
Internal communications showed hosts and executives privately

00:21:23.991 --> 00:21:28.671
mocking Trump’s claims, even as they aired them on their shows.

00:21:29.971 --> 00:21:34.371
Tucker Carlson, for example, was found calling Trump’s lawyer, Sidney

00:21:34.381 --> 00:21:40.206
Powell, a “liar,” while Laura Ingraham dismissed her as “nuts”, while at

00:21:40.221 --> 00:21:45.431
the same time, Fox News was reporting these as genuine, credible claims.

00:21:46.421 --> 00:21:54.088
Now, this Dominion settlement came in April of 2023 and was deeply frustrating for Murdoch,

00:21:54.428 --> 00:22:00.788
but even before that, there had been serious cracks in this formerly golden relationship.

00:22:01.558 --> 00:22:07.448
After the 2020 election, Trump’s refusal to admit defeat, the claims of fraud, and

00:22:07.448 --> 00:22:13.978
the events of January 6th, Murdoch had had it with Trump, he was fed up and was

00:22:13.978 --> 00:22:19.368
instructing Fox executives to distance the network from its former golden goose.

00:22:20.868 --> 00:22:27.408
He had no ideological or personal loyalty to Donald Trump and was keen to explore

00:22:27.408 --> 00:22:34.088
alternatives and do what he could to usher in a post-Trump Republican era.

00:22:35.028 --> 00:22:37.778
But this presented another dilemma.

00:22:38.628 --> 00:22:44.738
Would it be possible for Fox News to keep its Trump-loving audience without Donald Trump?

00:22:45.758 --> 00:22:52.998
Now, Fox News never completely turned its back on Trump, but it did experiment with alternatives.

00:22:54.068 --> 00:22:59.818
Murdoch’s idea was to support someone he thought was a more respectable

00:22:59.868 --> 00:23:05.568
conservative candidate, someone with Trumpian policies but who wasn’t Donald

00:23:05.588 --> 00:23:10.678
Trump, someone who he thought could be the future of the Republican party.

00:23:11.938 --> 00:23:18.548
This candidate was Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, to whom Fox initially gave favourable

00:23:18.578 --> 00:23:24.548
coverage in the hope that Fox News viewers would latch on to him as they did to Donald Trump.

00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:29.412
Unfortunately, this didn’t fly with the Fox audience.

00:23:29.962 --> 00:23:36.992
DeSantis was seriously lacking in charisma, and try as he might, he just wasn’t Donald Trump.

00:23:38.182 --> 00:23:44.262
His campaign was short-lived, and in January of 2024, he dropped out

00:23:44.262 --> 00:23:48.492
of the presidential race and pledged his full support for Donald Trump.

00:23:49.712 --> 00:23:54.212
When it became clear at the start of 2024 that Trump was going

00:23:54.212 --> 00:23:59.062
to be the Republican nominee, Fox News was backed into a corner.

00:24:00.182 --> 00:24:05.752
The next 5 years were either going to be spent criticising every action of a Democratic

00:24:05.782 --> 00:24:12.982
president or with a direct line to history’s greatest TV cash cow in the Oval Office.

00:24:13.942 --> 00:24:20.682
Perhaps understandably, given the lack of alternatives, Fox threw its full weight behind Trump,

00:24:21.112 --> 00:24:27.442
with executives no doubt hoping that Arizona might be a distant memory and that, like, during

00:24:27.442 --> 00:24:34.122
his first presidency, mutual self-interest might triumph over any kind of personal animosity.

00:24:35.252 --> 00:24:36.842
It appears to have worked.

00:24:37.992 --> 00:24:42.502
By the time this episode is released, Donald Trump will be three weeks into his

00:24:42.502 --> 00:24:47.752
second term in the White House, and Rupert Murdoch, assuming the miracles of modern

00:24:47.752 --> 00:24:53.342
healthcare keep doing their magic, will be a few weeks away from his 94th birthday.

00:24:54.412 --> 00:24:58.922
It will be 10 years into history’s most mutually profitable relationship

00:24:59.302 --> 00:25:05.272
between politician and media mogul, and although it has had its ups and downs,

00:25:05.502 --> 00:25:10.442
it seems like there is now too much at stake, too much money to be made and

00:25:10.727 --> 00:25:16.192
eyeballs to attract, for anything to come between Donald Trump and Fox News.

00:25:17.732 --> 00:25:23.672
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Rupert Murdoch, Donald Trump, and Fox News.

00:25:23.952 --> 00:25:27.192
