Hello, hello, hello, and welcome

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.060
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.930
Minds, by Leonardo English, the show

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.820
where you can listen to fascinating

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.340
stories and learn weird and wonderful

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.480
things about the world at the same

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.340
time as improving your English.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.300
I'm Alastair Budge, and today

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.710
we are going to be talking

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.430
about The Affair Of The Poisons.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.050
It's an almost unbelievable story

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.860
involving the king of France, black

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.490
magic, deceit, gossip, the Parisian

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.370
underworld, murder, torture, affairs

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.040
and, of course, plenty of poison.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.530
So, let’s not waste a minute,

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.370
and get right into it.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.630
There are many phrases in English that

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.420
we use to convey the idea that the

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.880
person at the top of an organisation,

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.780
whether that’s a family, a company,

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.700
or even a country, that this person

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.360
should set an example for how to behave.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.280
You can say “set an example”, or

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.720
“lead by example”, or “set the tone”,

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.030
and no doubt there are plenty of

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.340
similar phrases in your language.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.010
It is a universal truth; whatever

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.340
the person at the top does, that

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.700
tends to be the example that is

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.526
followed by those within their orbit.

00:01:29.564 --> 00:01:33.080
In 17th-century France, and to be more

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.913
precise, in the 17th-century French

00:01:35.963 --> 00:01:39.843
court, that person was King Louis XIV.

00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:42.883
He was the centre of everything.

00:01:43.533 --> 00:01:46.053
Just as the planets revolve around

00:01:46.053 --> 00:01:48.983
the sun, so too did the entire

00:01:49.013 --> 00:01:51.603
French court revolve around Louis.

00:01:51.963 --> 00:01:53.553
He wasn’t simply a monarch.

00:01:53.753 --> 00:01:56.903
He was France; the state, the culture,

00:01:56.913 --> 00:01:59.573
the fashion, the morality, even the

00:01:59.573 --> 00:02:03.303
gossip, it all radiated outward from him.

00:02:04.493 --> 00:02:07.193
He called himself le Roi Soleil — the

00:02:07.193 --> 00:02:10.313
Sun King — and was a firm believer

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:12.933
that he had been chosen by God

00:02:13.223 --> 00:02:15.468
to rule France, according to the

00:02:15.647 --> 00:02:18.479
so-called “Divine Right of Kings”.

00:02:19.391 --> 00:02:22.586
And of course, this god-given right was

00:02:22.756 --> 00:02:25.806
absolute; nothing else, not the church,

00:02:25.976 --> 00:02:29.166
not the nobility, even came close to the

00:02:29.176 --> 00:02:31.626
power that should be wielded by the king.

00:02:33.366 --> 00:02:36.096
One of the ways he did this was

00:02:36.096 --> 00:02:38.686
by bringing the nobility to him.

00:02:39.706 --> 00:02:42.576
No longer would powerful nobles rule

00:02:42.606 --> 00:02:44.606
distant corners of the country; they

00:02:44.606 --> 00:02:47.616
would all live at court, with the king,

00:02:48.093 --> 00:02:49.873
or at least they would if they wanted

00:02:49.873 --> 00:02:52.103
to have any kind of influence or power.

00:02:53.529 --> 00:02:56.599
And the centre of this power and influence

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:58.959
would be the Palace at Versailles,

00:02:59.309 --> 00:03:01.929
which Louis turned from a respectable

00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:05.109
chateau into a vast royal residence,

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:08.049
and a glittering stage from which

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.509
to project his power and splendour.

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:13.979
And the French aristocracy,

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.849
desperate to remain close to him,

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:19.139
played their roles accordingly.

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:22.999
Life at court was a performance.

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:25.389
Every look, every gesture,

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:27.389
every word had meaning.

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:31.099
But behind the dazzling chandeliers

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:34.059
and golden mirrors, it was also a world

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:37.289
of extreme excess and moral decay.

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:41.099
Louis had dozens of mistresses,

00:03:41.376 --> 00:03:43.646
with eight listed on his Wikipedia

00:03:43.646 --> 00:03:45.886
page as “among the better known”.

00:03:47.106 --> 00:03:49.656
Strangely enough, if you switch over to

00:03:49.656 --> 00:03:52.196
his French-language Wikipedia page, you’ll

00:03:52.196 --> 00:03:54.916
find 14 mistresses, instead of eight.

00:03:55.616 --> 00:03:56.726
No doubt there’s a joke

00:03:56.746 --> 00:03:57.506
in there somewhere…

00:03:58.746 --> 00:04:01.026
Anyway, some of these mistresses

00:04:01.146 --> 00:04:03.596
were official, some unofficial,

00:04:03.696 --> 00:04:05.346
merely whispered about in the

00:04:05.346 --> 00:04:07.896
shadows, and no doubt there were

00:04:07.896 --> 00:04:10.026
more who were unknown altogether.

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:14.536
Of those official, or semi-official

00:04:14.536 --> 00:04:17.066
ones, each brought with her a

00:04:17.076 --> 00:04:19.886
retinue of hangers-on and followers.

00:04:21.031 --> 00:04:23.221
All of these mistresses competed

00:04:23.421 --> 00:04:25.261
for the king’s attention with

00:04:25.471 --> 00:04:27.987
jewels, flattery, and favours.

00:04:28.622 --> 00:04:31.673
It was a kind of soft warfare, played

00:04:31.673 --> 00:04:34.453
out in silk and perfume, in secret

00:04:34.453 --> 00:04:36.663
corridors and garden pavilions.

00:04:37.993 --> 00:04:40.823
At the same time, nobles were kept

00:04:40.853 --> 00:04:42.963
busy with endless court rituals,

00:04:43.263 --> 00:04:45.733
distracted with pleasures, and in

00:04:45.733 --> 00:04:48.113
a seemingly never-ending game of

00:04:48.343 --> 00:04:51.423
spending one-upmanship, ostentatious

00:04:51.423 --> 00:04:53.643
displays of wealth and excess.

00:04:54.313 --> 00:04:57.063
They gambled away fortunes at the gaming

00:04:57.063 --> 00:04:59.853
tables, dressed in costumes that cost more

00:04:59.853 --> 00:05:03.103
than a village, and whispered behind fans

00:05:03.313 --> 00:05:05.883
as they plotted ways to climb the social

00:05:05.883 --> 00:05:09.460
ladder or planned their rivals’ downfalls.

00:05:11.003 --> 00:05:13.403
This was a world where appearances

00:05:13.403 --> 00:05:16.163
were everything, and survival depended

00:05:16.163 --> 00:05:18.433
on who you knew, how you charmed,

00:05:18.527 --> 00:05:20.606
and how far you were willing to go.

00:05:21.616 --> 00:05:23.696
And when charm wasn’t enough,

00:05:24.016 --> 00:05:26.616
some turned to darker methods.

00:05:27.226 --> 00:05:28.236
Love potions.

00:05:28.626 --> 00:05:29.426
Spells.

00:05:29.756 --> 00:05:30.886
Magical powders.

00:05:31.266 --> 00:05:32.026
Rituals.

00:05:32.486 --> 00:05:33.516
And poisons.

00:05:34.356 --> 00:05:37.046
Because if power flowed from the king,

00:05:37.366 --> 00:05:40.176
and you couldn’t reach him with wit or

00:05:40.196 --> 00:05:43.098
beauty, perhaps there were other ways.

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.236
This was the backdrop to The Affair of

00:05:47.239 --> 00:05:49.679
the Poisons, a scandal that began in the

00:05:49.679 --> 00:05:52.849
shadows of Paris, but crept ever closer

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:55.367
to Versailles, threatening to unravel the

00:05:55.367 --> 00:05:57.717
illusion of divine order and perfection

00:05:57.977 --> 00:06:00.557
that Louis had spent decades crafting.

00:06:01.907 --> 00:06:05.927
It all started in 1672, with the

00:06:05.927 --> 00:06:08.247
death of a dashing young cavalry

00:06:08.267 --> 00:06:10.677
officer named Godin de Sainte-Croix.

00:06:11.947 --> 00:06:14.767
Now, nothing appeared to be particularly

00:06:14.767 --> 00:06:17.607
strange about this man’s death, but

00:06:17.927 --> 00:06:19.747
when his belongings were collected,

00:06:20.177 --> 00:06:23.007
a red leather trunk was found.

00:06:24.247 --> 00:06:27.307
Inside were a series of love letters

00:06:27.547 --> 00:06:30.457
between him and an aristocratic married

00:06:30.587 --> 00:06:33.157
woman named Marie de Brinvilliers.

00:06:34.247 --> 00:06:36.827
Now, this was 17th-century France;

00:06:37.087 --> 00:06:38.917
it would probably have been more

00:06:38.917 --> 00:06:41.057
unusual if he hadn’t had a lover.

00:06:41.697 --> 00:06:44.017
But upon further inspection,

00:06:44.447 --> 00:06:46.357
the trunk contained something

00:06:46.637 --> 00:06:48.627
far more incriminating.

00:06:49.778 --> 00:06:51.953
A collection of vials containing

00:06:51.953 --> 00:06:56.303
strange substances: potions and poisons.

00:06:57.753 --> 00:06:59.913
The young cavalry officer had spent

00:06:59.923 --> 00:07:02.633
some time in prison, and there he

00:07:02.633 --> 00:07:05.213
had reportedly got to know an Italian

00:07:05.433 --> 00:07:08.473
master-poisoner, a man who knew how to

00:07:08.513 --> 00:07:10.463
prepare different natural ingredients,

00:07:10.753 --> 00:07:13.363
powders, and liquids to kill.

00:07:14.863 --> 00:07:17.283
The letters exchanged between the

00:07:17.283 --> 00:07:19.703
two lovers revealed that the pair

00:07:19.713 --> 00:07:22.153
had spent several years honing their

00:07:22.163 --> 00:07:25.273
craft, scientifically testing different

00:07:25.273 --> 00:07:28.003
combinations, and doing practical

00:07:28.003 --> 00:07:30.763
experiments on unwitting subjects.

00:07:32.113 --> 00:07:33.873
According to one report, Marie de

00:07:33.873 --> 00:07:36.363
Brinvilliers would choose one of

00:07:36.363 --> 00:07:39.463
her concoctions, add it to a cake

00:07:39.663 --> 00:07:42.353
or biscuit mixture, and then turn

00:07:42.353 --> 00:07:45.253
up at the Hôtel-Dieu, a large public

00:07:45.253 --> 00:07:47.383
hospital on the bank of the Seine.

00:07:48.473 --> 00:07:51.683
As a member of the French nobility, and

00:07:51.813 --> 00:07:54.203
without much else to do, she would be

00:07:54.203 --> 00:07:56.373
allowed to stroll up and down the hospital

00:07:56.373 --> 00:07:59.423
wards, visiting the sick and giving them

00:07:59.493 --> 00:08:02.973
token gifts: biscuits, cakes, and so on.

00:08:04.486 --> 00:08:07.226
To someone recovering from illness in

00:08:07.226 --> 00:08:09.726
a cold and damp hospital bed, it must

00:08:09.726 --> 00:08:12.060
have been a welcome diversion to have

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:14.150
someone come and talk to you, bringing

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:16.370
you delicious treats that you might

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:18.180
never have been able to afford yourself.

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:21.360
But it was, of course, not

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:23.220
particularly nice to find yourself

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:25.490
dead a matter of hours afterwards.

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:28.780
Now, it’s not known how long

00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:30.960
this went on for, or how many

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:32.854
innocent patients she murdered.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:36.250
It seems that nobody noticed, or at least

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:39.130
nobody seemed to question why people

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:41.440
didn’t survive for long after tasting

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.460
one of Marie de Brinvilliers’ biscuits.

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:46.720
These people were in hospital already,

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:49.160
it wasn’t so improbable that they would

00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:52.154
die there, and besides, an aristocratic

00:08:52.154 --> 00:08:54.074
young woman would never have been

00:08:54.074 --> 00:08:56.374
considered capable of doing such a thing.

00:08:56.804 --> 00:08:59.564
It was simply not in the female character,

00:08:59.724 --> 00:09:02.614
especially of a lady of such noble birth.

00:09:03.594 --> 00:09:05.454
Or so people thought…

00:09:07.008 --> 00:09:10.038
And if this wasn’t bad enough, there

00:09:10.038 --> 00:09:12.448
were more letters in the trunk, letters

00:09:12.698 --> 00:09:14.718
that revealed that sickly strangers

00:09:15.038 --> 00:09:17.359
hadn’t been the only victims of Marie

00:09:17.373 --> 00:09:19.618
de Brinvilliers’ poisonous concoctions.

00:09:21.156 --> 00:09:23.498
The letter revealed that she had also

00:09:23.508 --> 00:09:26.668
murdered her father and her two brothers,

00:09:27.188 --> 00:09:30.378
not out of spite or hatred, but for

00:09:30.388 --> 00:09:33.518
financial gain; she wanted the family

00:09:33.518 --> 00:09:36.168
fortune for herself and her children.

00:09:37.458 --> 00:09:39.558
When her lover was found dead,

00:09:40.008 --> 00:09:42.078
probably by accidentally poisoning

00:09:42.078 --> 00:09:44.218
himself, she must have realised

00:09:44.343 --> 00:09:46.363
that their secret would be revealed.

00:09:47.033 --> 00:09:49.293
She fled, hiding in England for four

00:09:49.303 --> 00:09:51.983
years, before being arrested in Belgium.

00:09:52.931 --> 00:09:55.371
During all of this time, she had been

00:09:55.371 --> 00:09:57.571
keeping a sort of journal with her

00:09:57.571 --> 00:10:00.441
various confessions, and in it she

00:10:00.451 --> 00:10:03.031
detailed how she had also tried to

00:10:03.031 --> 00:10:06.291
poison her sister-in-law and her husband.

00:10:07.601 --> 00:10:08.811
The game was up.

00:10:09.691 --> 00:10:11.901
She was condemned to death, but

00:10:12.151 --> 00:10:14.091
she was first to be subjected to

00:10:14.091 --> 00:10:15.941
something called “the water cure”,

00:10:16.471 --> 00:10:18.691
which was a kind of horrible torture

00:10:18.971 --> 00:10:21.211
where she was forced to drink 13 and

00:10:21.211 --> 00:10:23.651
a half litres of water, stretching

00:10:23.651 --> 00:10:25.631
her stomach to the point of agony.

00:10:26.991 --> 00:10:29.131
Then, she was taken to a public

00:10:29.141 --> 00:10:32.981
square–Place de Grève–her hair shaved, her

00:10:32.981 --> 00:10:35.801
head chopped off, and her remains burned.

00:10:37.224 --> 00:10:39.904
And this might have seemed like an

00:10:40.264 --> 00:10:42.854
isolated case–a murderous couple

00:10:42.854 --> 00:10:43.864
who thought they would never be

00:10:43.864 --> 00:10:46.714
caught–but it turned out to be the

00:10:46.724 --> 00:10:48.734
start of something much bigger.

00:10:49.754 --> 00:10:52.274
According to one report, before she

00:10:52.274 --> 00:10:54.444
was condemned to death, she said,

00:10:55.084 --> 00:10:57.504
“Out of so many guilty people, must

00:10:57.574 --> 00:11:00.044
I be the only one to be put to death?

00:11:00.494 --> 00:11:02.364
… Half the people in town are involved

00:11:02.364 --> 00:11:03.934
in this sort of thing, and I could

00:11:03.934 --> 00:11:05.794
ruin them all if I were to talk.”

00:11:06.724 --> 00:11:07.374
End quote.

00:11:08.274 --> 00:11:10.164
Half the people in town, meaning

00:11:10.394 --> 00:11:12.144
half the people in Paris, would

00:11:12.144 --> 00:11:14.354
have meant around 300,000 people

00:11:14.534 --> 00:11:16.844
poisoning family members and murdering

00:11:16.904 --> 00:11:18.628
unsuspecting hospital patients.

00:11:19.274 --> 00:11:21.764
Clearly, this was something of

00:11:21.764 --> 00:11:24.364
an exaggeration, but it turned

00:11:24.364 --> 00:11:26.884
out that it wasn’t so far off.

00:11:28.004 --> 00:11:29.934
According to one French historian,

00:11:30.324 --> 00:11:33.884
there were 400 witches and warlocks

00:11:33.994 --> 00:11:36.334
active in the capital at this time.

00:11:37.374 --> 00:11:40.174
Now, these weren’t cartoon-type

00:11:40.174 --> 00:11:42.724
witches; women in dark robes

00:11:42.724 --> 00:11:45.074
with pointed hats and black cats.

00:11:45.644 --> 00:11:48.314
But they did have cauldrons, or at

00:11:48.314 --> 00:11:50.854
least, one of their core specialities

00:11:51.074 --> 00:11:53.374
was the preparation of mysterious

00:11:53.454 --> 00:11:56.074
potions to heal, to make you more

00:11:56.074 --> 00:11:58.214
attractive, to force someone to fall

00:11:58.214 --> 00:12:01.054
in love with you, or indeed, to kill.

00:12:02.448 --> 00:12:05.148
The true extent of this seedy underworld

00:12:05.438 --> 00:12:08.078
started to be unravelled after another

00:12:08.078 --> 00:12:10.798
woman, Magdelaine de La Grange, was

00:12:10.828 --> 00:12:13.328
arrested on the charge of poisoning

00:12:13.328 --> 00:12:16.758
her lover, and she said pretty much the

00:12:16.758 --> 00:12:18.988
same thing as Marie de Brinvilliers,

00:12:19.648 --> 00:12:22.178
to paraphrase: “everyone’s doing it”.

00:12:23.098 --> 00:12:26.628
Word reached Louis XIV, and he ordered

00:12:26.648 --> 00:12:29.433
his chief of police, Gabriel Nicolas de

00:12:29.433 --> 00:12:32.686
La Reynie, to launch a full investigation.

00:12:34.166 --> 00:12:36.766
Now, de La Reynie had made a name

00:12:36.766 --> 00:12:39.726
for himself as a man who had “cleaned

00:12:39.726 --> 00:12:42.586
up” Paris; he reformed the police

00:12:42.586 --> 00:12:44.946
force, made sure the city was properly

00:12:44.956 --> 00:12:48.006
lit, and restored some semblance

00:12:48.036 --> 00:12:50.206
of law and order to the city.

00:12:50.856 --> 00:12:54.026
But there was still this underworld

00:12:54.126 --> 00:12:55.856
that he didn’t fully understand,

00:12:56.346 --> 00:12:58.506
and he was given the task of

00:12:58.572 --> 00:12:59.792
getting to the bottom of it.

00:13:01.122 --> 00:13:03.432
To deal with the fallout of this

00:13:03.442 --> 00:13:06.322
investigation, Louis XIV created

00:13:06.342 --> 00:13:08.682
a secretive tribunal called the

00:13:08.682 --> 00:13:11.092
Chambre Ardente, or “Burning

00:13:11.092 --> 00:13:13.952
Chamber,” so-named for the torch-lit

00:13:13.962 --> 00:13:15.982
basement where its judges met.

00:13:17.142 --> 00:13:19.932
Over the next three years, this would

00:13:19.942 --> 00:13:21.872
be the centre of the investigation,

00:13:22.172 --> 00:13:24.362
an investigation that uncovered the

00:13:24.362 --> 00:13:27.352
true extent of 17th-century France’s

00:13:27.382 --> 00:13:29.452
obsession with the supernatural.

00:13:30.962 --> 00:13:33.392
And what de La Reynie and this

00:13:33.402 --> 00:13:35.842
tribunal found was shocking.

00:13:36.493 --> 00:13:39.513
Fortune tellers, alchemists, all sorts

00:13:39.513 --> 00:13:42.343
of fraudsters and charlatans, and a

00:13:42.393 --> 00:13:45.193
bustling industry in the heart of Paris.

00:13:46.333 --> 00:13:49.173
But there was an even more sinister side.

00:13:50.253 --> 00:13:53.143
Alongside the people selling fake cures

00:13:53.143 --> 00:13:56.093
for headaches or lovesickness, there

00:13:56.093 --> 00:13:58.743
were others preparing deadly poisons,

00:13:58.993 --> 00:14:01.933
performing backroom abortions, and even

00:14:01.933 --> 00:14:04.683
conducting so-called “black masses”.

00:14:05.873 --> 00:14:08.403
What really happened at these “black

00:14:08.423 --> 00:14:10.703
masses” is something of a mystery,

00:14:11.123 --> 00:14:13.153
but it’s thought that they would

00:14:13.153 --> 00:14:15.683
involve an altar set up in a bedroom,

00:14:16.073 --> 00:14:18.813
a naked woman stretched across it, a

00:14:18.813 --> 00:14:21.983
chalice placed on her body, and, in

00:14:21.983 --> 00:14:25.113
some cases, the blood of a sacrificed

00:14:25.143 --> 00:14:28.563
infant used to invoke dark powers.

00:14:30.233 --> 00:14:32.723
And one of the women at the centre of

00:14:32.723 --> 00:14:35.247
this, Paris’s most famous alchemist,

00:14:35.567 --> 00:14:38.057
poisoner, abortionist and conductor

00:14:38.067 --> 00:14:40.837
of black masses, was a woman named

00:14:40.909 --> 00:14:43.767
Catherine Monvoisin, or simply “La

00:14:43.767 --> 00:14:46.107
Voisin”, the neighbour, in English.

00:14:47.277 --> 00:14:50.327
Men and women of Parisian high society

00:14:50.517 --> 00:14:52.757
would go to La Voisin for anything:

00:14:53.227 --> 00:14:56.087
fortune telling, love potions, medical

00:14:56.087 --> 00:14:58.957
treatments, abortions, black masses;

00:14:59.277 --> 00:15:00.997
there was practically no procedure

00:15:01.207 --> 00:15:03.317
that was beyond her stated abilities.

00:15:04.217 --> 00:15:06.177
Now, there are certainly plenty of

00:15:06.177 --> 00:15:07.994
question marks as to whether her

00:15:08.131 --> 00:15:10.967
incantations, love potions or medical

00:15:10.967 --> 00:15:13.207
treatments had any effect whatsoever.

00:15:14.437 --> 00:15:16.077
Unfortunately, there is little

00:15:16.077 --> 00:15:18.167
debate when it comes to things like

00:15:18.377 --> 00:15:20.227
abortions or the preparation of

00:15:20.227 --> 00:15:23.037
poison: she is estimated to have been

00:15:23.037 --> 00:15:25.307
responsible for the deaths of anywhere

00:15:25.307 --> 00:15:29.037
between 1,000 and 2,500 individuals.

00:15:30.227 --> 00:15:31.847
She must have thought herself to

00:15:31.847 --> 00:15:35.197
be invincible; after all, she had

00:15:35.197 --> 00:15:37.538
grown fabulously wealthy, she was

00:15:37.548 --> 00:15:39.738
providing a service to those at the

00:15:39.738 --> 00:15:42.468
very top of French society, and had

00:15:42.468 --> 00:15:44.338
people queuing around the block.

00:15:45.758 --> 00:15:49.568
But, on the 12th of March 1679,

00:15:49.928 --> 00:15:51.838
fresh out of mass, she was

00:15:51.858 --> 00:15:54.118
arrested on the church's steps.

00:15:54.971 --> 00:15:56.373
In the months that followed,

00:15:56.583 --> 00:15:57.813
she was interrogated.

00:15:58.863 --> 00:16:01.763
Interestingly enough, La Voisin wasn’t

00:16:01.773 --> 00:16:04.163
subjected to torture for most of her

00:16:04.163 --> 00:16:06.563
imprisonment, perhaps because the

00:16:06.563 --> 00:16:08.293
authorities feared what she might

00:16:08.313 --> 00:16:10.753
reveal, potentially information that

00:16:10.753 --> 00:16:12.873
might incriminate high-ranking members

00:16:13.053 --> 00:16:16.113
of the French aristocracy, perhaps even

00:16:16.113 --> 00:16:18.303
members of King Louis’s inner circle.

00:16:18.993 --> 00:16:21.963
But during her final interrogation, in

00:16:21.963 --> 00:16:25.723
February 1680, she was put to the boot

00:16:25.793 --> 00:16:28.513
torture: a brutal method designed to

00:16:28.553 --> 00:16:31.041
crush the legs and force confessions.

00:16:31.947 --> 00:16:34.879
Even then, she refused to name specific

00:16:34.939 --> 00:16:37.769
clients, only admitting that, and I’m

00:16:37.769 --> 00:16:39.987
quoting directly, “ a great number

00:16:39.987 --> 00:16:41.967
of persons of every sort of rank

00:16:41.967 --> 00:16:43.927
and condition addressed themselves

00:16:43.927 --> 00:16:46.307
to her to seek the death of or to

00:16:46.307 --> 00:16:48.607
find the means to kill many people”.

00:16:49.757 --> 00:16:52.556
In other words, rich and poor, of

00:16:52.566 --> 00:16:55.666
noble birth and normal people, came

00:16:55.666 --> 00:16:57.826
to seek her poisonous services.

00:16:58.748 --> 00:17:01.500
Now, it’s worth pausing for a moment

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:03.720
to talk about why so many people,

00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:06.760
especially women, turned to poison.

00:17:07.462 --> 00:17:09.710
It wasn’t that they were cold-hearted

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:12.045
murderers, but rather, it was

00:17:12.075 --> 00:17:14.605
often a desperate act of rebellion.

00:17:15.565 --> 00:17:19.015
In 17th-century France, women had little

00:17:19.035 --> 00:17:22.425
legal or financial power, and were trapped

00:17:22.615 --> 00:17:25.265
under the thumb of husbands or fathers.

00:17:26.145 --> 00:17:28.655
If they were cut out of wills, or

00:17:28.985 --> 00:17:31.694
abused by their fathers, brothers

00:17:31.694 --> 00:17:33.465
or husbands, there was precious

00:17:33.465 --> 00:17:35.095
little they could do about it.

00:17:36.155 --> 00:17:39.345
Poison became a secret weapon to escape

00:17:39.635 --> 00:17:42.125
abusive marriages, secure wealth, or

00:17:42.385 --> 00:17:45.125
defy a system that left them powerless.

00:17:46.315 --> 00:17:48.385
And it worked very well.

00:17:49.225 --> 00:17:50.915
Poisons like arsenic were

00:17:50.915 --> 00:17:52.765
nearly impossible to detect.

00:17:53.385 --> 00:17:56.352
They were tasteless, odourless, and

00:17:56.472 --> 00:17:59.772
invisible in autopsies, so people who

00:17:59.772 --> 00:18:02.132
were murdered by poison would typically be

00:18:02.132 --> 00:18:05.052
written off as dying of ‘natural causes’.

00:18:06.402 --> 00:18:08.502
And La Voisin was one of

00:18:08.502 --> 00:18:10.292
the women who made it all

00:18:10.342 --> 00:18:12.382
possible, for a while at least.

00:18:13.632 --> 00:18:17.092
In February of 1680, nearly a year

00:18:17.152 --> 00:18:20.183
after her arrest, she too was led to

00:18:20.183 --> 00:18:22.652
Place de Grève–the same square where de

00:18:22.652 --> 00:18:24.462
Brinvilliers had been beheaded four years

00:18:24.512 --> 00:18:27.832
earlier–and she was burned at the stake.

00:18:28.463 --> 00:18:30.203
She had taken the names of her

00:18:30.253 --> 00:18:32.183
trusted clients to the grave with

00:18:32.183 --> 00:18:35.323
her, but just a few months later, the

00:18:35.323 --> 00:18:37.653
identity of one would be revealed.

00:18:39.016 --> 00:18:41.478
La Voisin’s daughter confessed the name

00:18:41.608 --> 00:18:43.738
of one of her mother’s most secretive

00:18:43.748 --> 00:18:47.208
clients: Madame de Montespan, who just

00:18:47.208 --> 00:18:49.916
so happened to be one of Louis XIV’s

00:18:50.151 --> 00:18:52.508
favourite mistresses, and the mother

00:18:52.708 --> 00:18:55.318
of seven of his illegitimate children.

00:18:56.488 --> 00:18:58.908
According to witnesses, she had first

00:18:58.958 --> 00:19:03.103
sought out La Voisin in 1667 to conduct

00:19:03.133 --> 00:19:05.473
a series of “black masses”, with the

00:19:05.473 --> 00:19:07.843
objective of winning the king’s love.

00:19:08.933 --> 00:19:11.903
She also asked La Voisin to prepare

00:19:11.903 --> 00:19:14.673
a series of aphrodisiacs–magic

00:19:14.703 --> 00:19:17.143
potions–which she arranged to be

00:19:17.143 --> 00:19:19.463
slipped into his drink and food.

00:19:20.553 --> 00:19:22.832
Sure enough, a year later, she was

00:19:22.862 --> 00:19:25.262
added to his long list of mistresses.

00:19:26.162 --> 00:19:28.492
Now, the fact that she was prepared to

00:19:28.502 --> 00:19:30.412
go to the length of organising these

00:19:30.412 --> 00:19:32.582
pseudo-religious dark rituals and

00:19:32.582 --> 00:19:35.682
procuring aphrodisiacs probably gives

00:19:35.682 --> 00:19:37.882
you an idea of her determination to

00:19:37.882 --> 00:19:40.912
seduce the King, and his extensive list

00:19:40.912 --> 00:19:43.442
of mistresses suggests that it might not

00:19:43.442 --> 00:19:45.652
have been the toughest job in the world.

00:19:46.232 --> 00:19:48.584
But she clearly thought her

00:19:48.634 --> 00:19:50.754
success with the King was due

00:19:50.934 --> 00:19:52.924
to La Voisin’s magic powers.

00:19:53.754 --> 00:19:55.814
And after the pair had become

00:19:55.814 --> 00:19:57.994
lovers, her relationship with La

00:19:57.994 --> 00:20:00.704
Voisin became even more important.

00:20:01.548 --> 00:20:03.298
Whenever there was any kind of issue

00:20:03.558 --> 00:20:05.658
between her and the king, between

00:20:05.893 --> 00:20:07.358
her and a rival for the king’s

00:20:07.358 --> 00:20:09.748
affections, or an issue with anyone

00:20:09.748 --> 00:20:12.058
else at court, she would turn to her

00:20:12.128 --> 00:20:14.893
trusted back-street witch, La Voisin.

00:20:16.078 --> 00:20:17.858
There are even reports that she

00:20:17.858 --> 00:20:20.548
turned to her to poison the king.

00:20:21.978 --> 00:20:24.408
Louis was clearly not a man who

00:20:24.408 --> 00:20:27.188
put a great emphasis on loyalty and

00:20:27.208 --> 00:20:30.598
monogamy, and only a few years after

00:20:30.608 --> 00:20:32.538
Madame de Montespan had become his

00:20:32.538 --> 00:20:34.988
lover, did his eyes start to wander,

00:20:35.378 --> 00:20:37.748
and he started to lose interest.

00:20:38.836 --> 00:20:40.623
Together with La Voisin, de

00:20:40.623 --> 00:20:42.827
Montespan dreamed up a plan to

00:20:42.847 --> 00:20:45.497
poison one of her rivals, and it

00:20:45.497 --> 00:20:47.337
has even been alleged that they had

00:20:47.397 --> 00:20:49.817
planned to poison the king himself.

00:20:50.467 --> 00:20:53.267
If he was going to desert her, he must

00:20:53.267 --> 00:20:55.967
pay the price, so the theory goes.

00:20:56.857 --> 00:20:58.527
Fortunately for Louis, at least,

00:20:58.757 --> 00:21:00.527
La Voisin was arrested and

00:21:00.567 --> 00:21:02.607
executed before this could happen.

00:21:04.007 --> 00:21:06.747
And as for Madame de Montespan and her

00:21:06.767 --> 00:21:08.917
other poison-loving colleagues at court?

00:21:09.557 --> 00:21:11.477
If this information had got out,

00:21:11.627 --> 00:21:13.457
it would have been scandalous.

00:21:14.627 --> 00:21:16.207
But it didn’t.

00:21:17.207 --> 00:21:20.367
The investigation continued, but quietly.

00:21:21.137 --> 00:21:23.467
Arrests were made, but names were

00:21:23.467 --> 00:21:25.267
omitted from the public record.

00:21:25.967 --> 00:21:27.917
Madame de Montespan was never

00:21:27.917 --> 00:21:30.617
formally charged, but soon after,

00:21:30.647 --> 00:21:32.697
she lost her influence at court.

00:21:33.957 --> 00:21:37.777
And in 1682, the same year that the royal

00:21:37.777 --> 00:21:39.887
court officially moved to Versailles,

00:21:40.217 --> 00:21:42.627
the full investigation was closed.

00:21:43.907 --> 00:21:46.047
By then, the Chambre Ardente

00:21:46.287 --> 00:21:48.767
had charged 442 people.

00:21:49.387 --> 00:21:51.167
Thirty-six were executed.

00:21:51.427 --> 00:21:53.307
Dozens more were imprisoned

00:21:53.317 --> 00:21:54.987
for life or exiled.

00:21:55.542 --> 00:21:57.581
And countless others — especially

00:21:57.581 --> 00:21:59.631
among the nobility — simply

00:21:59.751 --> 00:22:01.321
vanished from the record.

00:22:02.081 --> 00:22:03.791
The scandal was swept

00:22:04.061 --> 00:22:05.251
under the royal carpet.

00:22:06.351 --> 00:22:08.911
This all coincided with the royal court’s

00:22:08.961 --> 00:22:11.401
official move to Versailles, a carefully

00:22:11.601 --> 00:22:13.961
stage-managed shift to an image of

00:22:13.961 --> 00:22:16.871
splendour, and perhaps an ideal moment

00:22:17.211 --> 00:22:19.911
to quietly bury the affair, along with

00:22:19.941 --> 00:22:21.851
any remaining embarrassing secrets.

00:22:22.461 --> 00:22:25.621
Not forgotten, exactly, but filed away.

00:22:26.047 --> 00:22:27.753
A stain on the Sun King’s

00:22:27.763 --> 00:22:29.843
legacy that no amount of gold

00:22:29.843 --> 00:22:31.663
or glitter could fully erase.

00:22:32.792 --> 00:22:34.928
And yet, the Affair of the Poisons

00:22:35.218 --> 00:22:36.608
is a reminder not just about

00:22:36.618 --> 00:22:38.703
Louis XIV and his court, but

00:22:39.248 --> 00:22:41.528
perhaps about human nature itself.

00:22:41.948 --> 00:22:44.238
That beneath the surface of the most

00:22:44.248 --> 00:22:46.938
refined societies, behind the manners,

00:22:47.218 --> 00:22:49.788
the titles, the rituals, there can lie

00:22:49.798 --> 00:22:52.508
a deep current of desperation — to be

00:22:52.508 --> 00:22:55.438
seen, to be loved, to hold on to power.

00:22:56.418 --> 00:22:58.428
And when the stakes are high

00:22:58.428 --> 00:23:00.488
enough, people will often

00:23:00.488 --> 00:23:03.318
turn to the darkest of means.

00:23:04.318 --> 00:23:06.278
OK, then, that is it for today's

00:23:06.278 --> 00:23:08.958
episode on the Affair of the Poisons.

00:23:09.218 --> 00:23:11.078
If you enjoyed this story and you

00:23:11.078 --> 00:23:12.778
haven’t had enough of mysteries at

00:23:12.778 --> 00:23:14.548
the French court, you might like to

00:23:14.548 --> 00:23:18.198
listen to episode number 479, about

00:23:18.208 --> 00:23:20.358
the Affair of the Diamond Necklace.

00:23:20.758 --> 00:23:22.658
There’s less poison, but there

00:23:22.658 --> 00:23:24.238
are affairs, a king called

00:23:24.238 --> 00:23:26.398
Louis, criminals, and of course

00:23:26.548 --> 00:23:28.578
a very large diamond necklace.

00:23:28.833 --> 00:23:30.531
I’ll put a link to that below, or you

00:23:30.531 --> 00:23:32.681
can just search for it on the website.

00:23:32.781 --> 00:23:35.901
It’s Episode number 479 and it’s called

00:23:35.941 --> 00:23:38.001
the Affair of the Diamond Necklace.

00:23:38.781 --> 00:23:40.831
You've been listening to English Learning

00:23:40.831 --> 00:23:43.511
