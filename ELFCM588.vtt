Hello, hello, hello, and welcome

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.780
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.590
Minds, by Leonardo English, the show

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:14.530
where you can listen to fascinating

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:16.930
stories and learn weird and wonderful

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:18.849
things about the world at the same

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:20.630
time as improving your English.

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.320
I'm Alastair Budge, and today it’s part

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.319
two of our three-part mini-series on

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.820
the loose theme of “words and language”.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.139
In part one, as our first episode of

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.230
2026, we talked about words of the year.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.840
Next up, in part three, we are going

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.150
to be talking about the unusual word

00:00:44.551 --> 00:00:47.300
“enshittification”, and today, in

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.050
part two, we’ll talk about euphemisms.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.760
What are they, where do they come from,

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.240
why do we use them, what do they tell

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.580
us about the English language, what

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.900
are some of the euphemisms you need

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.869
to know, and what are some unusual

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.190
euphemisms used by British newspapers to

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.889
say what they are too afraid to print?

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.379
So, let’s not waste a minute

00:01:11.809 --> 00:01:13.359
and get right into it.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.550
An oft-repeated criticism of

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.250
English speakers is that we

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.580
don’t always say what we mean.

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.570
On one level, it’s an odd criticism;

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.479
language exists as a means of

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.179
communication, with the primary purpose

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.510
of allowing one person to understand what

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.630
another person wants them to do or think.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.759
So why is it that English speakers

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:44.360
don’t always say what they mean, that

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.050
we disguise our language, that we

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.000
choose a more complicated expression or

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.950
phrase, when there is a perfectly good,

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.590
common word that we could use instead?

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:58.860
Why do we say “she is no longer with

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.460
us”, or “she passed away”, or “he is

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.180
with his family now”, when what we

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.760
really mean, and what would be an easier

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.410
thing to say, is “he or she is dead”?

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.790
Well, this is the language of

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.270
euphemism, the idea that we use a word

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.450
or expression to replace another that

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.929
might be uncomfortable or offensive.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.049
Euphemisms, as you might know, exist

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:30.100
in almost every major language.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.779
Humans are humans, and there are

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.280
certain subjects, no matter where you

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.239
come from, that are deemed difficult

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.249
to address using direct language.

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:44.780
Some languages use them more than others;

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.710
Japanese, for example, uses lots of

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.220
euphemistic language, which is all tied

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.210
to its cultural importance on harmony,

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.270
politeness, and avoiding embarrassment.

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:01.270
If you’ve spent time in Japan or have

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.210
Japanese colleagues, you may have

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.970
noticed that people often avoid saying

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.710
a direct “no”; instead, they will often

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:11.759
say something like “it would be a little

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:14.376
difficult” or “I will think about it”.

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.100
The meaning is the same —“no” —but in some

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.010
contexts it would be considered impolite.

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:24.150
It’s a similar thing

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.670
in some parts of China.

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.260
I remember teaching English in

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.000
China one summer during university,

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:32.880
along with a group of Americans.

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:36.570
There were two Chinese ladies in charge

00:03:36.836 --> 00:03:40.680
of the group, and, to put it mildly, one

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:42.940
of them didn’t do a particularly good

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.080
job, and I’m 99% sure she was fired.

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:50.420
One day, after a particular mishap,

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:52.599
she just didn’t turn up for work.

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.000
Instead of being told that she

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.100
was fired, we were told that

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.720
she was just feeling unwell.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.769
This was quite hard for many of the

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.630
Americans to understand, as they just

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.180
wanted a “straight”, honest answer,

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:11.690
but they hadn’t understood that

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.870
Chinese culture puts a big emphasis on

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.839
“face”, and saying that she had been

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.440
fired would have been disrespectful.

00:04:21.809 --> 00:04:25.229
German and other Nordic languages, as

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.370
you may know, tend to be far more direct.

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.190
There are still euphemisms, but they

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:33.010
aren’t used nearly as regularly.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.490
And romance languages tend to be somewhere

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.179
in the middle—French, Spanish, Italian

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:45.440
—they all use euphemisms, but not quite

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.199
to the same degree as we do in English.

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.200
So, that brings us to English.

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:54.229
English is actually one of the most

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.239
euphemism-rich languages in the

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.469
world, and especially in areas such as

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.690
death, health, sex, money, and work.

00:05:06.059 --> 00:05:08.650
We’ll talk about some specific

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.200
examples shortly, but the reason

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.860
for this heavy use of euphemisms in

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.390
English is partly historical, partly

00:05:18.429 --> 00:05:21.030
cultural, and partly psychological.

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:24.200
And this is the case both in

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.340
British and American English,

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.260
but for different reasons.

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.760
British culture has long favoured

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:34.390
understatement and politeness.

00:05:34.809 --> 00:05:37.380
There’s a deep-rooted cultural

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.360
discomfort with speaking too directly,

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:43.719
especially about unpleasant topics.

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.710
This is the case in personal

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:49.080
conversations, conversations between

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.360
one person and another, even between

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.139
friends and family, but is perhaps

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.530
even more so in professional contexts:

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:01.219
workplaces, politics, the news, and so on.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.049
And Americans, despite their reputation

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.500
for being outgoing and direct, well,

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.679
they are also big fans of euphemisms.

00:06:13.549 --> 00:06:15.859
Remember, the United States,

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.609
historically at least, was partly a

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:21.680
nation of Puritans, people who set

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:25.049
off from England in search of a purer,

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:28.700
holier life, free from the sins and

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.390
blasphemy going on back in Europe.

00:06:32.549 --> 00:06:36.039
And in some respects, Americans are even

00:06:36.059 --> 00:06:39.140
bigger users of euphemisms than Brits.

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.890
Americans talk about using the

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.260
“restroom” or “washroom” instead

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:46.849
of saying the word toilet.

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:50.849
In the UK, these expressions are

00:06:50.849 --> 00:06:53.739
less common, but you will still find

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:56.309
people typically using euphemisms

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.440
instead of saying “toilet”: you

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.730
might hear someone saying “bathroom”,

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.710
“lavatory”, or “loo” for short.

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:07.229
It might well be a similar thing in

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:10.079
your language: most romance languages

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:12.659
talk about using some variant of

00:07:12.899 --> 00:07:15.950
the “bath”, and in Chinese, as

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:17.660
you may know, you say that you are

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:19.690
going to the “wash hands room”.

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:23.020
It's even more removed in Japanese,

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:26.000
where you can talk about going to “pick

00:07:26.049 --> 00:07:29.090
flowers”, and as you might know if you’ve

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:31.950
been to Japan, sometimes this euphemism

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.900
is taken to an extreme, “real-life”

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:37.469
level, by having toilets that play

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:40.490
bird noises or songs to mask the sound

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:42.010
of what's actually going on in there.

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:46.240
Now, I’m going to try to keep the focus

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:49.330
on English here, to explore certain

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:52.160
English euphemisms, but the reason I

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.800
mention these other languages is to

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.630
reinforce the point that most languages,

00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:00.539
with a few exceptions, just don’t like

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:02.890
talking about certain things: bodily

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:06.640
functions, death, sex and intelligence.

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:09.700
So, let’s take these four

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:11.320
categories one by one.

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:14.170
We’ve already started on the bodily

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:16.180
functions, so let me continue.

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:19.080
Use the restroom, go to the bathroom,

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:22.279
spend a penny, powder your nose, answer

00:08:22.279 --> 00:08:24.739
nature’s call, go to the little boys’ or

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:27.050
little girls’ room, use the facilities;

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:30.219
these are all somewhat commonly used

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:32.960
euphemisms to mean “go to the toilet”.

00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:36.260
The list of expressions used is sort

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.939
of endless, with all sorts of slang

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:41.789
expressions you might hear, but these

00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:43.370
are some of the more common ones.

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:46.310
Death is another topic that,

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:48.439
perfectly understandably, most

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:50.399
people find uncomfortable talking

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.699
about, so we often use euphemisms

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:55.739
in English when talking about death.

00:08:56.490 --> 00:09:00.479
Instead of saying “he died”, we say “he

00:09:00.609 --> 00:09:03.290
passed away”, “he is no longer with us”,

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:06.400
“he departed this life”, “he’s at peace

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.540
now”, or even “he’s in a better place”.

00:09:10.469 --> 00:09:12.670
In formal announcements, you might

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:15.930
read “he succumbed to illness” or

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:18.250
“she lost her battle with cancer”.

00:09:19.459 --> 00:09:21.449
You’ll notice that some of these

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:24.660
euphemisms are religious in tone,

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:28.896
with ideas of heaven, peace, and the

00:09:28.896 --> 00:09:30.969
afterlife, while others are simply

00:09:31.259 --> 00:09:34.079
gentler ways of delivering hard news.

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:37.580
It can feel harsh or too abrupt to

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:41.020
say someone “died”, so we soften

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:43.090
it with more delicate language.

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:46.990
Then we have sex, which is full

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:49.070
of euphemisms, so full, in fact,

00:09:49.309 --> 00:09:51.089
that it’s often hard to keep track.

00:09:52.199 --> 00:09:54.710
Historically, in British English,

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:57.560
people would talk of someone “lying”

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:59.140
with someone else, or that two

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:02.050
people “lay” together, which was a

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:05.610
particularly polite and indirect way

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:07.840
of saying that two people had sex.

00:10:08.679 --> 00:10:11.920
Interestingly enough, “lay” came back

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:14.880
into common usage in the late 20th

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:17.610
century, in a much less euphemistic

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:21.840
way, in the passive form: “to get laid”,

00:10:22.059 --> 00:10:24.870
which is a sort of  euphemism for sex,

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:27.160
but not a particularly polite one.

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:30.900
And of course, like most languages, there

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:33.540
are hundreds, thousands of different

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:35.849
ways people might talk about having

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:38.809
sex, of varying levels of politeness,

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:42.320
and with a thin line between what

00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:44.990
is a euphemism and what is slang.

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:48.460
Expressions that are more euphemism

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:50.599
than slang might be things like

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.190
“sleep with”, “get with”, or even

00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:56.400
the more modern “Netflix and chill”.

00:10:57.389 --> 00:11:00.010
Now, each of these phrases carries

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:02.910
slightly different connotations — some

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:06.249
are more romantic, some more casual, some

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:09.480
more humorous — but they all serve the

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:11.709
same purpose: to talk about something

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:15.210
considered private or taboo in a way

00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:17.040
that doesn’t feel too uncomfortable.

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:21.259
And finally, we come to intelligence.

00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:24.890
In English, remarking on someone’s

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:28.120
intelligence, or lack of it, isn’t

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:29.890
a particularly nice thing to do;

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:32.100
it would be quite offensive to say

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:34.860
that someone is “stupid” or “dumb”.

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:39.699
So, to try to convey this in a slightly

00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:42.549
less offensive way, there are euphemisms.

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:45.860
You might hear someone say, “he’s not

00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:48.630
the sharpest tool in the shed”, or “she’s

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:50.730
not the sharpest knife in the drawer”.

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.920
You might also hear “she’s a bit slow”,

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:57.250
or “he’s a few cards short of a full

00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:59.429
deck”, or “not playing with a full

00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:02.210
deck”, “a little behind the curve”, or

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:04.350
“not the brightest bulb in the box”.

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:07.450
Sure, it still might not be a kind

00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:10.759
thing to use these expressions, but it

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:14.369
is, perhaps, less unkind than saying

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:17.554
it directly; these euphemisms  create a

00:12:17.564 --> 00:12:20.534
kind of linguistic padding between the

00:12:20.544 --> 00:12:23.604
speaker and a perhaps uncomfortable truth.

00:12:24.644 --> 00:12:27.094
Now, there are a few other interesting

00:12:27.224 --> 00:12:29.494
elements of euphemism to talk about.

00:12:30.154 --> 00:12:32.304
The first is something called the

00:12:32.314 --> 00:12:35.224
“euphemism treadmill”, which is the idea

00:12:35.464 --> 00:12:39.054
that euphemisms change over time, and

00:12:39.394 --> 00:12:42.404
with time, they become less of a euphemism

00:12:42.734 --> 00:12:45.644
and just another, unacceptable way of

00:12:45.644 --> 00:12:47.774
saying what was originally intended.

00:12:49.264 --> 00:12:52.104
For example, if we go back to euphemisms

00:12:52.304 --> 00:12:55.014
for someone who is not intelligent, 100

00:12:55.024 --> 00:12:57.104
years ago, you might have heard people

00:12:57.344 --> 00:12:59.514
talking about someone as an “idiot”,

00:13:00.154 --> 00:13:03.404
an “imbecile” or a “moron”, as a

00:13:03.414 --> 00:13:06.114
then-inoffensive way to address someone’s

00:13:06.144 --> 00:13:09.004
intelligence, or perceived lack of it.

00:13:09.884 --> 00:13:13.624
With time, those became used as slurs,

00:13:13.944 --> 00:13:16.804
offensive terms, so they were replaced

00:13:16.804 --> 00:13:19.614
by terms like someone being “retarded”.

00:13:20.384 --> 00:13:23.424
That too became a slur, was replaced by

00:13:23.454 --> 00:13:25.884
talking about someone having “special

00:13:25.884 --> 00:13:28.634
needs”, but this is now increasingly

00:13:28.634 --> 00:13:31.614
seen as offensive, and it’s preferable

00:13:31.814 --> 00:13:33.454
to talk about someone having an

00:13:33.784 --> 00:13:36.734
“intellectual disability”, which, if

00:13:36.734 --> 00:13:38.594
history is anything to go by, will

00:13:38.614 --> 00:13:40.824
come to be replaced in years to come.

00:13:42.354 --> 00:13:43.724
It’s a similar thing with

00:13:43.764 --> 00:13:45.724
race in the United States.

00:13:46.384 --> 00:13:48.824
In the 19th century, English

00:13:48.844 --> 00:13:51.644
used the term “negro”, coming

00:13:51.644 --> 00:13:53.504
from the Spanish word for black.

00:13:54.114 --> 00:13:56.874
Then came “coloured”, then “black”,

00:13:57.214 --> 00:13:59.924
then “African American”, then “person

00:13:59.964 --> 00:14:02.344
of colour”, and now the abbreviation

00:14:02.837 --> 00:14:05.824
“BIPOC” is more commonly used, meaning

00:14:06.054 --> 00:14:08.864
Black, Indigenous, and People of Colour.

00:14:09.744 --> 00:14:13.144
So, euphemisms change over time: what

00:14:13.144 --> 00:14:15.214
was once the preferred way to talk

00:14:15.224 --> 00:14:17.764
about something becomes offensive, and

00:14:17.954 --> 00:14:21.112
new euphemisms pop up to replace it.

00:14:22.104 --> 00:14:24.754
The final category I want to talk about

00:14:24.854 --> 00:14:27.474
is an unusual but funny one, and that’s

00:14:27.704 --> 00:14:30.384
euphemisms that are used by the British

00:14:30.414 --> 00:14:33.474
press to describe something they want

00:14:33.484 --> 00:14:36.014
the reader to understand, but don’t want

00:14:36.024 --> 00:14:38.514
to get into legal trouble for printing.

00:14:39.524 --> 00:14:42.244
The background to this is that the UK

00:14:42.404 --> 00:14:46.084
has very strict libel laws, meaning that

00:14:46.114 --> 00:14:49.134
if a newspaper prints something that

00:14:49.134 --> 00:14:52.064
accuses someone of having done something,

00:14:52.614 --> 00:14:54.474
they need to be able to prove it.

00:14:54.924 --> 00:14:57.654
You can’t just print “so and so did

00:14:57.664 --> 00:15:01.084
that”; they can accuse you of defamation,

00:15:01.454 --> 00:15:03.724
and if you can’t prove it’s true,

00:15:04.164 --> 00:15:06.714
they can sue you for a lot of money.

00:15:07.734 --> 00:15:11.074
And in 1957, The Spectator

00:15:11.124 --> 00:15:13.214
magazine published a story

00:15:13.464 --> 00:15:16.144
accusing three Labour politicians

00:15:16.434 --> 00:15:18.784
of being drunk at a conference.

00:15:19.514 --> 00:15:22.124
They might have looked drunk, but there

00:15:22.124 --> 00:15:25.604
was no way for the magazine to prove this,

00:15:25.834 --> 00:15:28.444
and it was successfully sued in court.

00:15:29.284 --> 00:15:31.864
So, given the frequency with

00:15:31.864 --> 00:15:33.574
which it happened, the British

00:15:33.594 --> 00:15:36.234
press started to come up with all

00:15:36.244 --> 00:15:38.794
manner of different euphemisms for

00:15:38.804 --> 00:15:41.354
expressing that someone was drunk.

00:15:42.544 --> 00:15:44.734
Most famously, people were

00:15:44.734 --> 00:15:48.134
described as “tired and emotional”.

00:15:48.774 --> 00:15:51.024
But there was also “worse for

00:15:51.024 --> 00:15:53.014
wear”, “under the weather”,

00:15:53.534 --> 00:15:56.484
“suffering from exhaustion”, “high

00:15:56.504 --> 00:15:59.624
spirited”, or “not quite himself”.

00:16:00.844 --> 00:16:03.164
In all these cases, the public

00:16:03.204 --> 00:16:06.084
knew what they meant, but if the

00:16:06.084 --> 00:16:07.664
newspapers were taken to court,

00:16:08.134 --> 00:16:10.404
they could say “hey, we didn’t mean

00:16:10.414 --> 00:16:12.814
drunk, we meant tired and emotional”.

00:16:14.144 --> 00:16:16.904
Similarly, newspapers might refer to

00:16:16.904 --> 00:16:20.154
someone’s “close friend”, “long-time

00:16:20.154 --> 00:16:22.644
friend”, or “travelling companion”,

00:16:23.214 --> 00:16:25.554
sometimes to mean an extra-marital

00:16:25.554 --> 00:16:28.184
lover, or a same-sex companion.

00:16:29.174 --> 00:16:31.394
Now, these are just a tiny

00:16:31.404 --> 00:16:34.044
selection of the rich tapestry of

00:16:34.074 --> 00:16:36.604
English-language euphemisms, and are

00:16:36.604 --> 00:16:38.864
meant to give you a small taste of

00:16:38.874 --> 00:16:41.714
how and why we use these expressions.

00:16:42.554 --> 00:16:45.584
And euphemisms are not fixed, people

00:16:45.604 --> 00:16:47.424
invent euphemisms all the time.

00:16:47.864 --> 00:16:50.724
They change, they evolve, and you might

00:16:50.734 --> 00:16:53.204
hear one you’ve never heard before because

00:16:53.204 --> 00:16:55.424
someone just invented it on the spot.

00:16:56.074 --> 00:16:58.664
So should you, as a non-native

00:16:58.674 --> 00:17:00.614
English speaker, use euphemisms?

00:17:01.124 --> 00:17:03.194
Of course, part of anyone’s

00:17:03.224 --> 00:17:05.834
fluency journey is learning how

00:17:05.874 --> 00:17:08.174
and when to use different registers

00:17:08.184 --> 00:17:09.834
of language and expressions.

00:17:10.264 --> 00:17:12.054
Learning every euphemism in English

00:17:12.224 --> 00:17:14.837
would be an impossible task, so there

00:17:14.837 --> 00:17:17.054
is little value in getting caught up in

00:17:17.054 --> 00:17:19.324
learning endless lists of euphemisms.

00:17:19.754 --> 00:17:23.034
But start to notice them, learn when

00:17:23.084 --> 00:17:25.244
native speakers use them, use them

00:17:25.244 --> 00:17:27.714
yourself in the same situations, and

00:17:27.724 --> 00:17:31.134
nobody will be able to accuse you of not

00:17:31.144 --> 00:17:33.144
being the sharpest knife in the drawer.

00:17:34.564 --> 00:17:36.664
OK, then, that is it for

00:17:36.664 --> 00:17:39.264
today's episode on euphemisms.

00:17:39.534 --> 00:17:40.894
I hope it's been an interesting one

00:17:41.174 --> 00:17:42.864
and that you've learnt something new.

00:17:43.334 --> 00:17:45.094
How many of these euphemisms

00:17:45.104 --> 00:17:46.074
had you heard before?

00:17:46.424 --> 00:17:47.764
What are some other ones that

00:17:47.764 --> 00:17:50.114
you have heard, and how do you

00:17:50.114 --> 00:17:52.414
use euphemisms in your language?

00:17:52.924 --> 00:17:54.794
I would love to know, so let’s

00:17:54.794 --> 00:17:56.154
get this discussion started.

00:17:56.454 --> 00:17:57.474
You can head right into our

00:17:57.474 --> 00:17:59.004
community forum, which is at

00:18:01.694 --> 00:18:03.594
chatting away to other curious minds.

00:18:04.444 --> 00:18:06.904
And, as a final reminder, this

00:18:07.064 --> 00:18:08.814
is part two of our three-part

00:18:08.814 --> 00:18:11.484
mini-series on the theme of “words”.

00:18:11.794 --> 00:18:13.694
In case you missed part one, it was

00:18:13.694 --> 00:18:16.124
on Words Of The Year, and next up,

00:18:16.334 --> 00:18:18.284
in our final part, we’ll be talking

00:18:18.294 --> 00:18:20.424
about a word that certainly isn’t

00:18:20.444 --> 00:18:22.614
a euphemism: enshittification.

00:18:23.454 --> 00:18:25.324
You've been listening to English Learning

00:18:25.324 --> 00:18:28.004
for Curious Minds by Leonardo English.

00:18:28.414 --> 00:18:31.134
I'm Alastair Budge, you stay safe, and

00:18:31.134 --> 00:18:33.284
I'll catch you in the next episode.
