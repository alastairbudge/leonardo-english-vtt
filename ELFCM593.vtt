Hello, hello, hello, and welcome

00:00:08.205 --> 00:00:10.075
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:10.075 --> 00:00:12.965
Minds, by Leonardo English, the show

00:00:13.085 --> 00:00:14.835
where you can listen to fascinating

00:00:14.835 --> 00:00:17.305
stories and learn weird and wonderful

00:00:17.315 --> 00:00:19.335
things about the world at the same

00:00:19.335 --> 00:00:21.115
time as improving your English.

00:00:21.625 --> 00:00:24.965
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are

00:00:24.965 --> 00:00:26.885
going to be talking about something

00:00:27.175 --> 00:00:29.455
you don’t normally find talked about

00:00:29.635 --> 00:00:32.925
in an English class: eunuchs, men

00:00:33.205 --> 00:00:35.175
who have had their testicles removed.

00:00:35.805 --> 00:00:38.395
It might seem like an unusual topic,

00:00:38.565 --> 00:00:41.465
but eunuchs have played a curious

00:00:41.665 --> 00:00:43.685
and important role throughout

00:00:43.695 --> 00:00:45.415
history, all over the world.

00:00:45.765 --> 00:00:47.635
And today, we are going

00:00:47.635 --> 00:00:49.105
to tell their story.

00:00:49.825 --> 00:00:52.295
As a quick disclaimer, although

00:00:52.335 --> 00:00:54.895
I will try to avoid particularly

00:00:54.905 --> 00:00:57.085
graphic descriptions, there will be

00:00:57.085 --> 00:00:59.295
some slightly intimate details in

00:00:59.295 --> 00:01:01.525
this episode, so if you are feeling

00:01:01.545 --> 00:01:03.985
particularly squeamish, or if you are

00:01:04.025 --> 00:01:06.105
eating your breakfast right now, well,

00:01:06.365 --> 00:01:09.005
please take this as a polite warning.

00:01:09.655 --> 00:01:12.585
OK, with that out of the way, let’s get

00:01:12.585 --> 00:01:15.905
right into it and talk about eunuchs.

00:01:17.235 --> 00:01:19.545
When doing research for this

00:01:19.545 --> 00:01:22.315
show, I often stumble across

00:01:22.585 --> 00:01:24.765
unfortunate characters from history.

00:01:25.215 --> 00:01:27.435
People who lived through tragic

00:01:27.435 --> 00:01:29.775
circumstances, losing children,

00:01:30.215 --> 00:01:32.755
parents, loved ones, overcoming

00:01:32.805 --> 00:01:35.615
unbelievable hardship, or perhaps

00:01:35.645 --> 00:01:37.225
not overcoming hardship at all,

00:01:37.585 --> 00:01:39.385
and simply dying very young.

00:01:40.345 --> 00:01:42.525
All the sort of stuff that makes

00:01:42.535 --> 00:01:44.765
me feel very fortunate to have

00:01:44.765 --> 00:01:47.545
been born when and where I was.

00:01:48.675 --> 00:01:52.045
High on my list of unfortunate characters

00:01:52.395 --> 00:01:56.775
is a young Roman boy known only as Sporus,

00:01:57.045 --> 00:02:00.345
who you may remember from our mini-series

00:02:00.395 --> 00:02:03.815
on Roman tyrants, in the episode on Nero.

00:02:04.455 --> 00:02:07.475
Now, Nero, as you may already know,

00:02:07.735 --> 00:02:09.745
and will certainly remember if you’ve

00:02:09.745 --> 00:02:11.325
listened to the episode on him,

00:02:11.745 --> 00:02:14.015
was a pretty nasty piece of work.

00:02:14.655 --> 00:02:16.885
He ordered the deaths of his mother,

00:02:17.195 --> 00:02:19.215
his stepbrother, and his first

00:02:19.215 --> 00:02:21.665
wife, as well as countless other

00:02:21.665 --> 00:02:23.875
people who got on his wrong side.

00:02:25.055 --> 00:02:27.745
Some historians even suggest that he

00:02:27.795 --> 00:02:30.735
killed his second wife, getting into a

00:02:30.735 --> 00:02:33.715
fit of rage and kicking her in the stomach

00:02:33.935 --> 00:02:36.355
while she was pregnant with his child.

00:02:37.135 --> 00:02:39.125
In the interests of balance, others

00:02:39.135 --> 00:02:41.485
say she might have died in childbirth.

00:02:41.965 --> 00:02:44.935
Whatever the truth, she died, and

00:02:44.935 --> 00:02:48.015
Nero went into a period of mourning.

00:02:48.645 --> 00:02:51.115
But then, two years later, in

00:02:51.115 --> 00:02:53.705
circumstances that are now forgotten

00:02:53.705 --> 00:02:56.555
to history, he caught sight of a

00:02:56.565 --> 00:02:59.405
young boy, a strikingly beautiful

00:02:59.405 --> 00:03:02.775
young boy who he thought bore an

00:03:02.865 --> 00:03:06.035
uncanny resemblance to his dead wife.

00:03:07.215 --> 00:03:10.305
Nero being Nero, he didn’t just see

00:03:10.305 --> 00:03:12.505
this boy and get a little bit sad

00:03:12.755 --> 00:03:14.615
and emotional about his dead wife.

00:03:15.135 --> 00:03:17.195
No, he ordered for the

00:03:17.195 --> 00:03:18.985
boy to be brought to him.

00:03:19.655 --> 00:03:22.805
And not only that, he ordered for the

00:03:22.805 --> 00:03:26.125
boy to be castrated, his testicles cut

00:03:26.125 --> 00:03:29.205
off, then dressed up in woman’s clothing.

00:03:29.665 --> 00:03:32.425
He was given jewellery, attendants, and

00:03:32.425 --> 00:03:36.265
told about his new role: Nero’s bride.

00:03:37.215 --> 00:03:39.825
And later that year, he got married;

00:03:40.346 --> 00:03:43.655
Nero, the Roman emperor, married the

00:03:43.655 --> 00:03:47.315
now eunuch, Sporus, and the pair lived

00:03:47.375 --> 00:03:50.235
together until Nero’s death a year later.

00:03:51.375 --> 00:03:53.835
It would appear that Sporus didn’t

00:03:53.845 --> 00:03:55.435
have much choice in the matter;

00:03:55.975 --> 00:03:58.075
one day he was happily walking

00:03:58.075 --> 00:03:59.925
along, minding his own business,

00:04:00.285 --> 00:04:02.455
and the next he was being castrated

00:04:02.705 --> 00:04:04.395
and married to the Roman emperor.

00:04:05.205 --> 00:04:07.765
It's one of the most disturbing stories

00:04:07.765 --> 00:04:11.115
of power, cruelty, and control in ancient

00:04:11.125 --> 00:04:14.575
history, but it's also a good example of

00:04:14.575 --> 00:04:17.305
something else — the idea that eunuchs

00:04:17.375 --> 00:04:20.035
have, throughout history, often found

00:04:20.035 --> 00:04:22.415
themselves in positions of surprising

00:04:22.455 --> 00:04:25.085
influence, and proximity to power.

00:04:26.145 --> 00:04:29.225
Now, Sporus’ story is clearly

00:04:29.275 --> 00:04:32.015
extreme, but he was far from the

00:04:32.075 --> 00:04:34.405
only eunuch in the ancient world.

00:04:34.855 --> 00:04:38.345
For thousands of years, from China to

00:04:38.345 --> 00:04:41.165
the Middle East, Rome to West Africa,

00:04:41.565 --> 00:04:44.802
young boys and even adult men were

00:04:44.802 --> 00:04:47.575
turned into eunuchs, and ended up

00:04:47.615 --> 00:04:50.115
playing the role of trusted advisers,

00:04:50.435 --> 00:04:53.268
military commanders, political fixers,

00:04:53.445 --> 00:04:56.385
royal servants, and sometimes even the

00:04:56.385 --> 00:04:59.525
most powerful people in entire empires.

00:05:00.425 --> 00:05:02.555
Which raises the question: why?

00:05:03.105 --> 00:05:05.935
Why did so many civilisations create

00:05:05.945 --> 00:05:09.315
entire systems around castrated men?

00:05:10.315 --> 00:05:13.215
Why did emperors often trust these

00:05:13.215 --> 00:05:15.475
eunuchs more than ordinary men?

00:05:15.945 --> 00:05:17.925
Why did they give them access to the

00:05:17.925 --> 00:05:19.785
most private spaces in the palace?

00:05:20.195 --> 00:05:23.595
And why were eunuchs, people who suffered

00:05:23.605 --> 00:05:25.725
one of the most brutal procedures

00:05:25.775 --> 00:05:28.925
imaginable, sometimes able to rise

00:05:28.955 --> 00:05:31.165
to extraordinary heights of power?

00:05:32.475 --> 00:05:35.315
On one level, the basic logic was the

00:05:35.315 --> 00:05:37.935
same in every society where eunuchs

00:05:37.955 --> 00:05:40.885
existed, and it’s not hard to see why.

00:05:41.735 --> 00:05:43.825
A eunuch, because he could

00:05:43.825 --> 00:05:45.995
not have children, was seen as

00:05:46.005 --> 00:05:48.605
someone without personal ambition.

00:05:49.115 --> 00:05:51.345
He could not start his own dynasty,

00:05:51.415 --> 00:05:53.875
pass on wealth or titles, or

00:05:54.095 --> 00:05:56.295
be tempted to seize the throne

00:05:56.475 --> 00:05:58.285
for the benefit of future sons.

00:05:59.015 --> 00:06:00.955
At the same time, because he was

00:06:00.985 --> 00:06:03.785
castrated, he was also believed to

00:06:03.785 --> 00:06:06.515
pose no sexual threat, which was

00:06:06.515 --> 00:06:08.875
especially important in palaces

00:06:09.075 --> 00:06:11.815
filled with wives, concubines,

00:06:12.005 --> 00:06:14.065
and female relatives of the ruler.

00:06:14.905 --> 00:06:17.455
In other words, he was a man who might

00:06:17.455 --> 00:06:20.305
be completely loyal to the king, both

00:06:20.385 --> 00:06:23.185
politically and personally, because

00:06:23.285 --> 00:06:25.405
he could not have any descendants and

00:06:25.405 --> 00:06:27.845
was thought to be sexually harmless.

00:06:28.605 --> 00:06:32.165
In practice, this was a rather optimistic

00:06:32.165 --> 00:06:35.465
view — eunuchs could be just as ambitious,

00:06:35.735 --> 00:06:38.715
cunning, or politically skilled as anyone

00:06:38.715 --> 00:06:41.695
else, and there are cases of eunuchs

00:06:41.725 --> 00:06:44.055
being involved in sexual relationships

00:06:44.565 --> 00:06:47.125
— still, the idea seemed to stick.

00:06:48.555 --> 00:06:51.195
And if you are wondering how people

00:06:51.275 --> 00:06:53.415
thousands of years ago with a very

00:06:53.425 --> 00:06:55.345
rudimentary understanding of human

00:06:55.345 --> 00:06:58.325
biology knew that castrating meant

00:06:58.355 --> 00:06:59.945
that a man wouldn’t be able to have

00:06:59.955 --> 00:07:02.985
children, well, this is thought to

00:07:02.985 --> 00:07:05.225
have come from observing animals.

00:07:06.035 --> 00:07:08.965
For thousands of years before the first

00:07:08.995 --> 00:07:11.965
written records of eunuchs, humans

00:07:12.205 --> 00:07:14.465
had already been castrating animals

00:07:14.675 --> 00:07:17.985
such as cows, sheep, goats and pigs.

00:07:18.985 --> 00:07:21.315
They noticed that whenever they did

00:07:21.315 --> 00:07:25.005
this, the animals became calmer, easier

00:07:25.005 --> 00:07:27.535
to control, and more predictable.

00:07:28.145 --> 00:07:30.495
A castrated bull wouldn’t

00:07:30.505 --> 00:07:32.185
try to dominate the herd.

00:07:32.515 --> 00:07:34.975
A castrated ram, a male

00:07:34.975 --> 00:07:36.625
sheep, wouldn’t fight.

00:07:37.325 --> 00:07:39.935
People also noticed that castrated

00:07:39.965 --> 00:07:43.635
animals didn’t try to mate; their interest

00:07:43.645 --> 00:07:46.495
in reproduction all but disappeared.

00:07:47.525 --> 00:07:49.835
Even if they did occasionally

00:07:49.865 --> 00:07:52.465
mount other animals, it was pretty

00:07:52.565 --> 00:07:56.085
half-hearted and never led to offspring.

00:07:56.925 --> 00:07:59.635
So even before people knew how the

00:07:59.645 --> 00:08:02.315
biology behind reproduction worked,

00:08:02.715 --> 00:08:05.655
the pattern was obvious: remove the

00:08:05.655 --> 00:08:08.515
testicles and the animal becomes

00:08:08.515 --> 00:08:10.695
more obedient and, importantly,

00:08:10.985 --> 00:08:13.875
infertile, unable to reproduce.

00:08:14.645 --> 00:08:17.545
It didn’t take a huge leap of imagination

00:08:17.835 --> 00:08:20.835
for early rulers to apply the same logic

00:08:21.065 --> 00:08:24.115
to humans, thereby creating a class

00:08:24.175 --> 00:08:27.245
of servants who, like those animals,

00:08:27.465 --> 00:08:30.485
were seen as loyal, manageable, and

00:08:30.505 --> 00:08:33.515
entirely dependent on their master.

00:08:34.165 --> 00:08:38.055
And thus preferable to normal, uncastrated

00:08:38.055 --> 00:08:40.885
men, men who wanted to have children,

00:08:40.945 --> 00:08:43.625
who might be aggressive, and crucially,

00:08:43.855 --> 00:08:46.065
were able to be sexually active.

00:08:46.855 --> 00:08:49.745
So castration, in these early

00:08:49.745 --> 00:08:52.535
societies, wasn’t just a punishment;

00:08:52.775 --> 00:08:55.255
it was a political technology, a

00:08:55.255 --> 00:08:58.225
way of creating a specific kind of

00:08:58.225 --> 00:09:00.745
servant, one who was believed to be

00:09:00.745 --> 00:09:03.585
safe, dependable, and controllable.

00:09:04.525 --> 00:09:06.635
And we see this throughout

00:09:06.845 --> 00:09:07.875
the ancient world.

00:09:08.465 --> 00:09:10.385
The very first references to eunuchs

00:09:10.705 --> 00:09:14.425
date back to over 4,000 years, to

00:09:14.465 --> 00:09:17.785
ancient Mesopotamia, in modern-day Iraq.

00:09:18.515 --> 00:09:21.135
There are mentions of royal attendants at

00:09:21.185 --> 00:09:24.615
courts who appear to have been castrated,

00:09:24.705 --> 00:09:26.725
although there is still a bit of debate

00:09:26.755 --> 00:09:28.715
among historians about the details.

00:09:29.465 --> 00:09:32.305
But by the time we reach the Assyrian

00:09:32.305 --> 00:09:36.315
Empire, around the 9th century BC, the

00:09:36.315 --> 00:09:39.815
idea of the eunuch is unmistakable.

00:09:40.675 --> 00:09:43.895
In carvings and palace reliefs, we see

00:09:43.945 --> 00:09:46.345
powerful-looking officials — sometimes

00:09:46.345 --> 00:09:48.555
holding weapons, sometimes carrying

00:09:48.565 --> 00:09:50.645
messages, sometimes guarding the

00:09:50.645 --> 00:09:53.205
king — described in inscriptions

00:09:53.425 --> 00:09:56.125
using words that suggest castration.

00:09:57.425 --> 00:09:59.115
And it spread.

00:09:59.685 --> 00:10:03.215
Across the ancient world, from Mesopotamia

00:10:03.215 --> 00:10:06.655
to Persia, from Greece to Egypt, we

00:10:06.655 --> 00:10:09.625
see variations of the same logic:

00:10:10.155 --> 00:10:13.635
eunuchs serving as guardians, diplomats,

00:10:13.835 --> 00:10:17.205
scribes, treasurers, commanders, and

00:10:17.225 --> 00:10:20.485
private attendants to kings and queens.

00:10:21.185 --> 00:10:24.735
But it was in one civilisation above all

00:10:24.765 --> 00:10:27.615
others that the eunuch system reached

00:10:27.635 --> 00:10:30.495
its most elaborate, most organised,

00:10:30.775 --> 00:10:33.395
and arguably most powerful form.

00:10:34.325 --> 00:10:35.615
Imperial China.

00:10:36.912 --> 00:10:39.582
If you imagine all the well-known court

00:10:39.592 --> 00:10:42.692
eunuchs of world history — the ones who

00:10:42.692 --> 00:10:45.612
ruled behind the throne, advised emperors,

00:10:45.802 --> 00:10:48.602
led military expeditions, or controlled

00:10:48.622 --> 00:10:51.882
entire bureaucracies — the majority of

00:10:51.882 --> 00:10:54.642
the most famous examples come from China.

00:10:55.392 --> 00:10:58.112
And this is reflective of quite how

00:10:58.112 --> 00:11:01.132
important eunuchs were in Imperial China.

00:11:01.872 --> 00:11:05.882
For over 2,000 years, from the Qin dynasty

00:11:06.122 --> 00:11:09.672
in the 3rd century BC right through until

00:11:09.672 --> 00:11:12.322
the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1912,

00:11:12.602 --> 00:11:15.562
barely more than 100 years ago, Chinese

00:11:15.562 --> 00:11:18.782
emperors relied heavily on eunuchs.

00:11:19.652 --> 00:11:22.122
And to give you an idea of quite

00:11:22.172 --> 00:11:24.922
how widespread this practice was,

00:11:25.262 --> 00:11:27.472
it’s estimated that at the end

00:11:27.482 --> 00:11:30.012
of the Ming dynasty, in the 17th

00:11:30.032 --> 00:11:32.612
century, there were somewhere in the

00:11:32.612 --> 00:11:37.172
region of 100,000 eunuchs in China.

00:11:38.602 --> 00:11:41.922
Most were deployed across the empire as

00:11:41.962 --> 00:11:44.672
loyal administrators: tax collectors,

00:11:44.982 --> 00:11:47.242
industry supervisors, and so on.

00:11:47.792 --> 00:11:50.252
Essentially keeping an eye on the

00:11:50.262 --> 00:11:53.412
sprawling empire and being tasked with

00:11:53.422 --> 00:11:55.832
reporting back to the Imperial palace.

00:11:56.492 --> 00:11:59.542
But a small percentage of these

00:11:59.542 --> 00:12:02.092
eunuchs had a more important role:

00:12:02.562 --> 00:12:05.292
working inside the Forbidden City,

00:12:05.632 --> 00:12:07.352
controlling access to the emperor,

00:12:07.742 --> 00:12:10.392
and managing the imperial household.

00:12:11.092 --> 00:12:12.642
If you have ever been to Beijing,

00:12:13.072 --> 00:12:14.622
you will know that the Forbidden

00:12:14.622 --> 00:12:18.532
City is a vast complex: 980

00:12:18.532 --> 00:12:22.382
buildings and almost 10,000 rooms.

00:12:23.182 --> 00:12:26.642
It can broadly be split into two sections:

00:12:26.912 --> 00:12:29.642
the inner court, and the outer court.

00:12:30.492 --> 00:12:32.242
And apart from the emperor,

00:12:32.902 --> 00:12:35.432
the eunuchs were the only males

00:12:35.652 --> 00:12:37.582
allowed into the inner court.

00:12:38.165 --> 00:12:40.382
There were a few exceptions, like

00:12:40.502 --> 00:12:42.912
young imperial princes or official

00:12:42.922 --> 00:12:45.402
visitors, but these would be highly

00:12:45.402 --> 00:12:47.922
regulated, by the eunuchs of course.

00:12:49.092 --> 00:12:51.912
The logic behind allowing eunuchs,

00:12:52.072 --> 00:12:54.342
and nobody else, was the same as in

00:12:54.422 --> 00:12:56.192
other societies that used eunuchs:

00:12:56.742 --> 00:12:58.642
because they were castrated, they

00:12:58.652 --> 00:13:01.472
posed no sexual threat and would have

00:13:01.472 --> 00:13:04.372
no sexual desire, so the emperor’s

00:13:04.382 --> 00:13:07.572
wife and concubines were not at risk.

00:13:08.912 --> 00:13:11.462
Now, most eunuchs entered the

00:13:11.462 --> 00:13:14.382
palace as young boys or teenagers.

00:13:15.012 --> 00:13:18.122
Some were sold by desperate families,

00:13:18.292 --> 00:13:20.412
some were taken as punishment or

00:13:20.412 --> 00:13:23.872
tribute, and a small number chose

00:13:23.882 --> 00:13:26.912
castration voluntarily, usually

00:13:27.092 --> 00:13:29.852
because life inside the palace offered

00:13:29.852 --> 00:13:32.205
more stability than life outside it.

00:13:33.212 --> 00:13:35.352
Once inside, their lives

00:13:35.525 --> 00:13:37.012
were tightly regulated.

00:13:37.482 --> 00:13:40.152
They were given small rooms, strict

00:13:40.242 --> 00:13:43.492
timetables, and assigned to departments

00:13:43.722 --> 00:13:45.582
that handled everything from cooking the

00:13:45.582 --> 00:13:48.022
emperor’s meals to managing his clothing,

00:13:48.392 --> 00:13:50.242
cleaning his chambers, guarding the

00:13:50.242 --> 00:13:53.132
gates, or organising imperial ceremonies.

00:13:53.722 --> 00:13:56.602
They were household servants, essentially.

00:13:57.818 --> 00:14:00.628
At the lowest levels, the work was

00:14:00.718 --> 00:14:03.268
exhausting and often humiliating.

00:14:04.008 --> 00:14:05.908
These eunuchs would spend long

00:14:05.908 --> 00:14:08.708
days sweeping corridors, carrying

00:14:08.708 --> 00:14:10.708
firewood, or running errands

00:14:10.708 --> 00:14:12.658
across the vast palace grounds.

00:14:13.088 --> 00:14:14.498
They were not allowed to

00:14:14.508 --> 00:14:15.928
leave without permission.

00:14:16.338 --> 00:14:18.678
They could be beaten for mistakes.

00:14:18.808 --> 00:14:20.748
Their entire lives were at

00:14:20.758 --> 00:14:22.848
the mercy of their superiors.

00:14:23.458 --> 00:14:26.268
But every eunuch knew that the

00:14:26.288 --> 00:14:28.868
palace was also a place where

00:14:28.878 --> 00:14:31.058
fortunes could change quickly.

00:14:31.648 --> 00:14:34.468
A kind word from a senior eunuch, a

00:14:34.498 --> 00:14:37.418
small act of loyalty noticed by the

00:14:37.418 --> 00:14:40.788
emperor, a minor promotion — any of these

00:14:40.978 --> 00:14:43.398
could open the door to a better life.

00:14:44.638 --> 00:14:47.308
And at the very top of the eunuch

00:14:47.498 --> 00:14:51.078
hierarchy were positions of immense power.

00:14:51.968 --> 00:14:54.398
The Chief Eunuch, sometimes called

00:14:54.398 --> 00:14:57.418
Director of Ceremonial or the Supervisor

00:14:57.578 --> 00:15:00.048
of the Inner Court, he controlled

00:15:00.368 --> 00:15:03.098
access to the emperor — and this

00:15:03.098 --> 00:15:06.078
made him one of the most influential

00:15:06.128 --> 00:15:08.298
people in the entire empire.

00:15:09.158 --> 00:15:11.188
If a minister wanted to speak

00:15:11.188 --> 00:15:12.928
to the emperor, he needed

00:15:12.928 --> 00:15:13.888
the eunuch’s permission.

00:15:14.228 --> 00:15:16.228
If a message needed to reach the

00:15:16.228 --> 00:15:18.948
throne, it passed through eunuch hands.

00:15:19.488 --> 00:15:21.758
Even the empress and imperial

00:15:21.758 --> 00:15:23.738
concubines, who lived in the

00:15:23.818 --> 00:15:25.878
inner palace, they depended on

00:15:25.948 --> 00:15:28.198
eunuchs for daily communication.

00:15:29.545 --> 00:15:33.055
This created a curious political

00:15:33.055 --> 00:15:35.855
reality: although eunuchs could

00:15:35.855 --> 00:15:38.205
not hold official government posts,

00:15:38.525 --> 00:15:40.355
they often knew more about what was

00:15:40.355 --> 00:15:42.255
happening in the palace than the

00:15:42.255 --> 00:15:44.695
highest-ranking ministers outside it.

00:15:45.575 --> 00:15:47.785
They saw the emperor every day.

00:15:48.215 --> 00:15:49.455
They heard his complaints.

00:15:49.735 --> 00:15:51.415
They knew which advisers he

00:15:51.415 --> 00:15:53.795
trusted and which he disliked.

00:15:54.195 --> 00:15:56.245
They would even witness private

00:15:56.295 --> 00:15:58.725
arguments within the imperial family.

00:15:59.825 --> 00:16:03.315
That kind of access translated into power,

00:16:03.805 --> 00:16:07.335
real power, and it didn’t go unnoticed.

00:16:08.045 --> 00:16:10.945
Eunuchs became the subject of deep

00:16:11.015 --> 00:16:13.645
resentment, especially from the

00:16:13.675 --> 00:16:16.135
Confucian scholars: the highly

00:16:16.175 --> 00:16:19.215
educated men who ran the civil service.

00:16:19.905 --> 00:16:21.785
These were men who had spent

00:16:21.795 --> 00:16:24.715
years mastering classical texts,

00:16:25.075 --> 00:16:28.055
passing brutal exams, and preparing

00:16:28.055 --> 00:16:29.595
themselves for government.

00:16:30.195 --> 00:16:32.595
They believed that they should be

00:16:32.595 --> 00:16:34.935
the emperor’s closest advisers, and

00:16:35.125 --> 00:16:37.615
guardians of virtue and good governance.

00:16:37.895 --> 00:16:40.775
Not the eunuchs, palace servants whose

00:16:40.865 --> 00:16:43.065
only qualification seemed to be the

00:16:43.065 --> 00:16:45.315
removal of a bit of their anatomy.

00:16:46.095 --> 00:16:48.455
But you can probably understand

00:16:48.605 --> 00:16:50.645
why emperors so often preferred

00:16:50.645 --> 00:16:52.125
the company of the eunuchs.

00:16:52.485 --> 00:16:55.085
Scholars could be opinionated,

00:16:55.475 --> 00:16:58.075
moralising, and, from an emperor’s

00:16:58.075 --> 00:17:00.805
point of view, irritatingly willing

00:17:01.005 --> 00:17:02.785
to tell him what he should do.

00:17:03.605 --> 00:17:06.385
Eunuchs, by contrast, lived in

00:17:06.385 --> 00:17:08.115
the imperial palace, spent their

00:17:08.115 --> 00:17:10.275
entire lives serving the emperor,

00:17:10.615 --> 00:17:13.275
and often knew him from childhood.

00:17:13.695 --> 00:17:16.295
They were not part of elite families,

00:17:16.325 --> 00:17:19.395
they had no sons to advance, and they

00:17:19.415 --> 00:17:22.705
owed their entire identity to the court.

00:17:23.425 --> 00:17:25.365
They were far more likely to go

00:17:25.365 --> 00:17:27.445
along with whatever the emperor said.

00:17:27.995 --> 00:17:29.805
And who doesn’t like being

00:17:29.805 --> 00:17:31.115
told that they are right?

00:17:32.535 --> 00:17:35.155
And for certain eunuchs who built

00:17:35.305 --> 00:17:37.225
close relationships with the emperor,

00:17:37.625 --> 00:17:39.625
they could be richly rewarded.

00:17:40.455 --> 00:17:43.345
Some eunuchs became fabulously wealthy.

00:17:43.805 --> 00:17:45.505
Some commanded armies.

00:17:45.775 --> 00:17:47.675
Some toppled governments.

00:17:48.605 --> 00:17:51.395
And one of them — perhaps the most famous

00:17:51.395 --> 00:17:55.075
eunuch in all of Chinese history, Zheng He

00:17:55.365 --> 00:17:58.025
— would go on to command one of the greatest

00:17:58.045 --> 00:18:01.005
naval fleets that the world has ever seen.

00:18:01.775 --> 00:18:03.405
Perhaps you don’t immediately

00:18:03.405 --> 00:18:05.565
associate being a eunuch with being

00:18:05.565 --> 00:18:07.865
a heroic military commander, but

00:18:08.135 --> 00:18:10.185
China’s greatest naval commander

00:18:10.505 --> 00:18:12.625
was made a eunuch as a young boy.

00:18:13.395 --> 00:18:16.025
Now, China might have produced some of

00:18:16.035 --> 00:18:18.645
the most famous eunuchs in history, but

00:18:18.895 --> 00:18:21.295
it was far from the only place where

00:18:21.295 --> 00:18:23.765
castrated men played important roles.

00:18:24.475 --> 00:18:27.495
For almost 500 years, the Ottoman Empire

00:18:27.755 --> 00:18:30.395
made heavy use of eunuchs to supervise

00:18:30.415 --> 00:18:32.785
the sultan’s harem — his mother,

00:18:33.045 --> 00:18:35.615
wives, daughters and their servants.

00:18:36.268 --> 00:18:38.175
Like in China, some of these

00:18:38.175 --> 00:18:40.185
eunuchs became fabulously wealthy,

00:18:40.775 --> 00:18:43.325
and like in China, their influence

00:18:43.515 --> 00:18:45.635
depended entirely on the ruler.

00:18:46.135 --> 00:18:48.405
A strong sultan might keep eunuchs

00:18:48.655 --> 00:18:51.035
firmly in their place; a weak one

00:18:51.275 --> 00:18:53.295
might rely on them so heavily that

00:18:53.305 --> 00:18:55.135
they effectively ran the palace.

00:18:56.075 --> 00:18:58.955
It was a similar story in Byzantium, as

00:18:58.955 --> 00:19:00.995
well as in various Islamic caliphates

00:19:01.265 --> 00:19:03.515
and west African tribal societies.

00:19:04.335 --> 00:19:07.445
India is another story, with eunuchs

00:19:07.465 --> 00:19:09.735
being classified as “third gender”,

00:19:10.065 --> 00:19:12.945
neither male nor female, which brings

00:19:12.945 --> 00:19:15.005
us into an entirely different topic

00:19:15.175 --> 00:19:16.605
that we aren’t going to cover today.

00:19:17.712 --> 00:19:19.952
And there was, of course, the different

00:19:20.172 --> 00:19:22.472
but still worth mentioning tradition of

00:19:22.472 --> 00:19:25.392
the castrati, the young boys who would

00:19:25.402 --> 00:19:28.572
be castrated before puberty in order to

00:19:28.592 --> 00:19:31.332
preserve their high-pitched singing voice.

00:19:32.182 --> 00:19:35.372
So, to wrap things up, eunuchs are

00:19:35.372 --> 00:19:38.162
not a quirk of Chinese history, nor a

00:19:38.172 --> 00:19:40.982
footnote in the story of Nero’s Rome.

00:19:41.382 --> 00:19:43.132
They are part of a much broader

00:19:43.132 --> 00:19:45.952
pattern — one that appears in empires

00:19:45.962 --> 00:19:48.246
separated by thousands of kilometres

00:19:48.462 --> 00:19:49.652
and with completely different

00:19:49.752 --> 00:19:51.872
cultural or religious traditions.

00:19:52.832 --> 00:19:55.102
Whenever societies had strongly

00:19:55.112 --> 00:19:58.272
gender-segregated spaces, concerns about

00:19:58.282 --> 00:20:01.132
dynastic stability, rulers who feared

00:20:01.132 --> 00:20:04.002
rivals, or political systems built on

00:20:04.082 --> 00:20:07.102
personal loyalty rather than institutions,

00:20:07.542 --> 00:20:09.502
they often turned to eunuchs.

00:20:10.282 --> 00:20:12.452
The extraordinary thing, perhaps,

00:20:12.892 --> 00:20:15.402
is not that eunuchs existed, but

00:20:15.672 --> 00:20:18.072
that they existed almost everywhere

00:20:18.372 --> 00:20:20.542
for more than three thousand years.

00:20:21.782 --> 00:20:24.572
And not to get too much into the

00:20:24.582 --> 00:20:27.472
gory details, but the process

00:20:27.472 --> 00:20:29.742
of becoming a eunuch, of being

00:20:29.772 --> 00:20:32.062
castrated, was horrendous.

00:20:32.462 --> 00:20:35.582
It was incredibly painful, mortality

00:20:35.582 --> 00:20:38.572
rates were very high, often due to

00:20:38.572 --> 00:20:41.592
infection or massive blood loss after

00:20:41.602 --> 00:20:45.132
the procedure, and even if a boy was

00:20:45.142 --> 00:20:47.222
lucky enough to survive the operation,

00:20:47.692 --> 00:20:49.612
he could look forward to a series

00:20:49.612 --> 00:20:51.822
of long-term health complications.

00:20:52.512 --> 00:20:54.512
And that's before we talk about

00:20:54.532 --> 00:20:57.362
any of the emotional or social

00:20:57.372 --> 00:20:59.132
challenges that would come from it.

00:21:00.182 --> 00:21:03.012
Clearly, it was a horrendous practice.

00:21:04.172 --> 00:21:06.752
And fortunately, by the start of

00:21:06.752 --> 00:21:08.842
the 20th century, the practice

00:21:09.162 --> 00:21:10.572
had practically died out.

00:21:11.152 --> 00:21:14.322
It was officially banned in 1924 in

00:21:14.332 --> 00:21:17.912
China, and the era of the eunuch was over.

00:21:18.982 --> 00:21:21.892
By the 1950s and 60s, only a

00:21:21.892 --> 00:21:23.912
handful of eunuchs remained.

00:21:24.782 --> 00:21:27.882
What is remarkable — and historically

00:21:27.982 --> 00:21:30.232
invaluable — is that several of

00:21:30.232 --> 00:21:33.012
these last eunuchs lived long enough

00:21:33.242 --> 00:21:35.172
to be interviewed by journalists,

00:21:35.502 --> 00:21:38.242
historians, and documentary filmmakers.

00:21:39.332 --> 00:21:41.272
One of the most famous was a

00:21:41.272 --> 00:21:44.372
man called Sun Yaoting, a man

00:21:44.582 --> 00:21:46.652
dubbed “China’s last eunuch.”

00:21:47.732 --> 00:21:52.112
He was born in 1902, and castrated as a

00:21:52.182 --> 00:21:54.752
teenager in the hope of gaining a palace

00:21:54.772 --> 00:21:58.212
position, but by the time he finished

00:21:58.222 --> 00:22:01.492
healing the empire had already collapsed.

00:22:02.262 --> 00:22:04.622
He eventually found work inside the

00:22:04.632 --> 00:22:07.562
Forbidden City, serving the old imperial

00:22:07.562 --> 00:22:10.692
household, and later worked as a caretaker

00:22:10.982 --> 00:22:12.892
after the palace became a museum.

00:22:14.292 --> 00:22:17.192
In later interviews, he described the

00:22:17.202 --> 00:22:20.392
daily life of eunuchs — the strictness,

00:22:20.412 --> 00:22:24.092
the hierarchy, the loneliness, the moments

00:22:24.182 --> 00:22:27.802
of unexpected pride, and the deep sense of

00:22:27.832 --> 00:22:30.892
identity that came from serving the court.

00:22:31.772 --> 00:22:35.582
He also spoke candidly about the pain of

00:22:35.582 --> 00:22:38.432
his castration, the lost opportunities,

00:22:38.802 --> 00:22:41.602
and the strange feeling of belonging

00:22:41.602 --> 00:22:43.872
to a world that no longer existed.

00:22:45.152 --> 00:22:47.212
It’s kind of mad to think.

00:22:47.652 --> 00:22:50.262
For thousands of years, all over the

00:22:50.332 --> 00:22:53.002
world, this, I think we can safely say,

00:22:53.022 --> 00:22:56.082
barbaric practice was a fundamental

00:22:56.082 --> 00:22:58.542
part of many countries’ administration.

00:22:59.202 --> 00:23:00.742
Eunuchs were everywhere.

00:23:01.142 --> 00:23:03.492
Then, almost in the blink

00:23:03.492 --> 00:23:05.292
of an eye, they disappeared.

00:23:06.302 --> 00:23:08.412
All that remains are fragments,

00:23:08.732 --> 00:23:12.292
stories, records, and the voices of a

00:23:12.302 --> 00:23:15.262
few men who bore the cruel marks of an

00:23:15.272 --> 00:23:18.052
old system, and lived long enough to

00:23:18.052 --> 00:23:21.292
describe a world that no longer exists.

00:23:22.842 --> 00:23:24.632
OK, then, that is it for

00:23:24.632 --> 00:23:26.792
today's episode on eunuchs.

00:23:27.032 --> 00:23:28.332
I hope it's been an interesting one,

00:23:28.592 --> 00:23:30.312
and that you've learnt something new.

00:23:30.922 --> 00:23:33.512
And something you can’t say everyday is

00:23:33.512 --> 00:23:35.172
that you’ve both learned about eunuchs

00:23:35.432 --> 00:23:37.332
and learned English at the same time.

00:23:37.922 --> 00:23:39.642
You've been listening to English Learning

00:23:39.642 --> 00:23:42.312
for Curious Minds by Leonardo English.

00:23:42.602 --> 00:23:45.412
I'm Alastair Budge, you stay safe, and

00:23:45.412 --> 00:23:47.662
I'll catch you in the next episode.
