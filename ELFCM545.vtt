Hello, hello, hello, and welcome

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:05.040
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.010
Minds, by Leonardo English, the show

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:09.930
where you can listen to fascinating

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.399
stories and learn weird and wonderful

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.480
things about the world at the same

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.349
time as improving your English.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.269
I'm Alastair Budge, and today,

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:21.390
is the start of yet another

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:22.990
three-part mini-series.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.759
This one is on the topic of World War I.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.839
But we aren’t really going to

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.749
talk all that much about World

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:32.953
War I, at least not directly.

00:00:33.523 --> 00:00:35.913
Instead, we are going to explore

00:00:35.923 --> 00:00:38.143
this period through the lives of

00:00:38.203 --> 00:00:40.543
unusual characters involved in the

00:00:40.543 --> 00:00:43.013
war, some more directly than others.

00:00:43.433 --> 00:00:47.183
So, in today’s episode, part one, we

00:00:47.183 --> 00:00:49.053
are going to talk about the amazing

00:00:49.053 --> 00:00:52.573
story of T.E. Lawrence, the British

00:00:52.613 --> 00:00:54.933
archaeologist and army officer who

00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:57.243
fought alongside Arabian tribesmen

00:00:57.493 --> 00:01:00.343
for a united Arab nation, all

00:01:00.443 --> 00:01:02.393
while harbouring a guilty secret.

00:01:03.163 --> 00:01:06.013
Next up, in part two, we’ll learn about

00:01:06.023 --> 00:01:09.253
the story of Mata Hari, the Dutch woman

00:01:09.413 --> 00:01:12.053
who became an exotic dancer and the talk

00:01:12.053 --> 00:01:14.803
of Paris, before being executed by a

00:01:14.813 --> 00:01:17.893
firing squad on the charge of being a spy.

00:01:18.173 --> 00:01:20.123
And in part three, in the interests

00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:22.853
of balance, we will talk about Manfred

00:01:22.853 --> 00:01:25.223
von Richthofen, a German aircraft

00:01:25.263 --> 00:01:27.963
pilot so deadly he was known to his

00:01:27.963 --> 00:01:31.563
enemies as “The Red Baron”. OK then,

00:01:31.813 --> 00:01:35.003
let’s get right into it and learn about

00:01:35.013 --> 00:01:38.853
the unlikely life of T.E. Lawrence.

00:01:40.513 --> 00:01:43.493
A title you will often find in lists

00:01:43.523 --> 00:01:46.213
of “The Greatest Films Ever Made” is

00:01:46.213 --> 00:01:50.443
the 1962 classic “Lawrence of Arabia”.

00:01:51.243 --> 00:01:54.003
The trailer for the film opens with

00:01:54.013 --> 00:01:57.123
wide-angle shots of a man trekking

00:01:57.133 --> 00:01:59.673
through a vast desert on a camel.

00:02:00.573 --> 00:02:03.773
As the camel obediently plods forward,

00:02:04.123 --> 00:02:06.003
putting one foot in front of the

00:02:06.003 --> 00:02:08.433
other in the scorching desert sand,

00:02:08.913 --> 00:02:10.873
you hear the words of the narrator,

00:02:11.413 --> 00:02:13.993
ostensibly about the man on the camel.

00:02:15.183 --> 00:02:18.363
He says, “I deem him one of the

00:02:18.363 --> 00:02:20.813
greatest beings alive in our time.

00:02:21.293 --> 00:02:24.003
His name will live in history. It

00:02:24.003 --> 00:02:26.886
will live in the annals of war…it

00:02:26.886 --> 00:02:29.616
will live in the legends of Arabia.”

00:02:30.846 --> 00:02:32.766
The quote is attributed

00:02:32.906 --> 00:02:34.296
to Winston Churchill.

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.576
Immediately, the viewer is hooked.

00:02:37.906 --> 00:02:40.436
If Churchill, the great wartime

00:02:40.446 --> 00:02:43.466
leader, is calling this man “one of

00:02:43.466 --> 00:02:45.686
the greatest beings alive in our time”,

00:02:46.136 --> 00:02:48.826
well, that certainly is something.

00:02:50.143 --> 00:02:52.013
The trailer continues, with the

00:02:52.013 --> 00:02:55.403
narrator going on to say that “no man

00:02:55.403 --> 00:02:58.503
of our time has drawn upon himself so

00:02:58.503 --> 00:03:01.253
much praise and so much criticism”.

00:03:02.573 --> 00:03:04.753
It is a fair assessment, but

00:03:05.003 --> 00:03:07.283
now we must move from talking

00:03:07.323 --> 00:03:09.743
about the movie to the real man.

00:03:11.283 --> 00:03:15.563
Thomas Edward Lawrence was born in 1888

00:03:15.863 --> 00:03:19.553
in north Wales, the second of five sons.

00:03:20.223 --> 00:03:22.953
He was a shy but passionate boy.

00:03:23.613 --> 00:03:24.963
When he set his mind to

00:03:24.963 --> 00:03:26.533
something, he did it.

00:03:27.493 --> 00:03:29.953
And from an early age he was

00:03:29.983 --> 00:03:31.703
passionate about history.

00:03:32.463 --> 00:03:35.193
When he was 15, he spent the summer

00:03:35.433 --> 00:03:38.383
cycling around a large area of southern

00:03:38.393 --> 00:03:40.623
England with a friend, visiting

00:03:40.693 --> 00:03:43.123
every single church he came across.

00:03:43.763 --> 00:03:46.383
The boys took notes, made rubbings

00:03:46.383 --> 00:03:49.173
of brass memorials, and when they had

00:03:49.173 --> 00:03:51.623
finished, they presented their findings

00:03:51.863 --> 00:03:54.213
to the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford.

00:03:55.603 --> 00:03:57.783
As you might imagine, the museum’s

00:03:57.783 --> 00:04:00.803
curators were astounded and impressed

00:04:01.003 --> 00:04:02.793
by the boys’ attention to detail.

00:04:04.073 --> 00:04:06.723
And this wasn’t a one-off.

00:04:07.083 --> 00:04:09.873
The teenage boy had got the bug, he

00:04:09.873 --> 00:04:12.363
had had a small taste of adventure.

00:04:13.263 --> 00:04:15.443
Later that summer, he cycled

00:04:15.463 --> 00:04:17.823
around France on his own, visiting

00:04:17.833 --> 00:04:20.113
medieval castles and taking notes.

00:04:20.523 --> 00:04:23.303
Then he did the same thing again the

00:04:23.303 --> 00:04:26.723
following summer, still aged only 16.

00:04:27.743 --> 00:04:30.613
This clear passion for understanding

00:04:30.623 --> 00:04:33.273
the past earned him a place at Oxford

00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:36.333
University, where he read history, and

00:04:36.643 --> 00:04:40.383
for his thesis, he went one step further.

00:04:41.493 --> 00:04:44.673
In his last year at university, and aged

00:04:44.713 --> 00:04:48.023
only 20, he embarked on a three-month

00:04:48.043 --> 00:04:51.116
trip to Syria to study castles of the

00:04:51.116 --> 00:04:54.116
crusader era, so medieval castles.

00:04:54.766 --> 00:04:57.966
Now, even putting aside the more recent

00:04:58.016 --> 00:04:59.626
political instability in the region,

00:05:00.126 --> 00:05:03.256
even in the 21st century, Syria is

00:05:03.256 --> 00:05:05.386
not the easiest country to get around.

00:05:06.006 --> 00:05:09.835
But Lawrence visited in 1909,

00:05:10.256 --> 00:05:12.286
and he was going from abandoned

00:05:12.286 --> 00:05:13.916
castle to abandoned castle.

00:05:14.356 --> 00:05:15.896
There was practically no

00:05:15.936 --> 00:05:18.246
infrastructure, no way of getting

00:05:18.256 --> 00:05:19.946
from one castle to the next.

00:05:20.286 --> 00:05:23.256
So…he mostly walked and rode on

00:05:23.276 --> 00:05:25.596
donkeys, claiming to have travelled

00:05:25.596 --> 00:05:29.376
a grand total of 1,600 kilometres.

00:05:30.606 --> 00:05:32.396
He had already developed a keen

00:05:32.416 --> 00:05:35.396
interest in the Middle East, but this

00:05:35.416 --> 00:05:37.856
trip really took it to a new level.

00:05:39.176 --> 00:05:42.166
And this area, I should add, was

00:05:42.166 --> 00:05:44.026
still part of the Ottoman Empire.

00:05:44.346 --> 00:05:47.176
There was no Syria, no Lebanon,

00:05:47.186 --> 00:05:49.486
no Jordan, this was all part of

00:05:49.486 --> 00:05:51.336
the sprawling Ottoman Empire.

00:05:52.146 --> 00:05:54.106
And this will be of vital

00:05:54.126 --> 00:05:56.306
importance to the rest of our story.

00:05:57.136 --> 00:06:01.806
So, in 1910, at the age of 22, Thomas

00:06:01.836 --> 00:06:05.056
Lawrence graduated, and like any fresh

00:06:05.056 --> 00:06:07.626
graduate, he was in the market for a job.

00:06:08.496 --> 00:06:10.416
Clearly not any job, though.

00:06:10.916 --> 00:06:12.386
It would have to involve some

00:06:12.406 --> 00:06:14.526
form of exploring the past,

00:06:14.826 --> 00:06:16.606
preferably in the Middle East.

00:06:17.454 --> 00:06:19.729
And sure enough, he did not become

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:22.219
a lawyer or an accountant; he

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:24.649
found a job as an archaeologist.

00:06:25.329 --> 00:06:27.069
He worked across the Middle

00:06:27.069 --> 00:06:28.979
East, in modern-day Lebanon,

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:31.839
Syria, Israel and Egypt.

00:06:33.049 --> 00:06:35.968
And he seemed different from

00:06:35.968 --> 00:06:37.228
most of the other Western

00:06:37.228 --> 00:06:39.648
archaeologists exploring the area.

00:06:40.318 --> 00:06:42.608
He studied Arabic, and spoke

00:06:42.608 --> 00:06:44.018
it practically fluently.

00:06:44.488 --> 00:06:47.178
He was actually interested in the language

00:06:47.178 --> 00:06:49.208
and culture of the people living there,

00:06:49.638 --> 00:06:52.188
whereas most of his fellow archaeologists

00:06:52.458 --> 00:06:54.578
believed they were there to teach;

00:06:54.618 --> 00:06:56.428
there was nothing they could learn

00:06:56.428 --> 00:06:59.188
from these backwards “desert people”.

00:07:00.408 --> 00:07:03.734
Now, fast forward to 1914.

00:07:04.418 --> 00:07:07.088
The assassination of Archduke Franz

00:07:07.088 --> 00:07:09.058
Ferdinand of Austria, in the now

00:07:09.068 --> 00:07:11.738
Bosnian capital of Sarajevo, had

00:07:11.768 --> 00:07:14.218
ripple effects that extended all

00:07:14.218 --> 00:07:16.168
the way to the Arabian desert.

00:07:17.288 --> 00:07:20.068
As you may know, or remember from

00:07:20.068 --> 00:07:22.028
our last mini-series on the theme

00:07:22.028 --> 00:07:23.768
of the fall of the Ottoman Empire,

00:07:24.208 --> 00:07:26.968
the Ottomans sided with Germany.

00:07:28.028 --> 00:07:31.428
Suddenly, this vast swathe of territory

00:07:31.448 --> 00:07:33.528
in the Middle East was the enemy.

00:07:34.798 --> 00:07:37.978
Lawrence was sent to Egypt, which was

00:07:38.038 --> 00:07:39.518
under the rule of the British at the

00:07:39.518 --> 00:07:42.548
time, where he was tasked with making

00:07:42.548 --> 00:07:44.898
sense of what was going on in the region.

00:07:46.068 --> 00:07:48.208
He was, in many ways, the

00:07:48.248 --> 00:07:49.688
perfect man for the job.

00:07:50.288 --> 00:07:52.768
He spoke Arabic, he understood

00:07:52.768 --> 00:07:55.008
local customs and traditions, and

00:07:55.498 --> 00:07:57.898
he felt more at home in the Middle

00:07:57.898 --> 00:07:59.918
East than he did back in England.

00:08:00.798 --> 00:08:02.978
But at this stage, Lawrence

00:08:02.988 --> 00:08:05.158
was not yet a hero, not yet the

00:08:05.348 --> 00:08:07.108
legendary “Lawrence of Arabia.”

00:08:07.728 --> 00:08:10.268
He was simply a junior intelligence

00:08:10.298 --> 00:08:12.608
officer, working behind the scenes in

00:08:12.608 --> 00:08:15.418
Cairo, reading reports, interrogating

00:08:15.418 --> 00:08:17.468
prisoners, and trying to make

00:08:17.468 --> 00:08:20.278
sense of the complex tribal and

00:08:20.298 --> 00:08:22.018
political landscape of the region.

00:08:23.218 --> 00:08:25.118
And it was complex.

00:08:25.668 --> 00:08:28.228
The Ottoman Empire ruled over the Middle

00:08:28.228 --> 00:08:31.811
East, but its control was not absolute.

00:08:32.811 --> 00:08:35.541
In the deserts of Arabia, tribal leaders

00:08:35.631 --> 00:08:38.151
held enormous power, often ruling

00:08:38.201 --> 00:08:40.601
over their lands with little direct

00:08:40.611 --> 00:08:42.631
interference from Constantinople.

00:08:43.671 --> 00:08:46.361
The British, who were desperate to weaken

00:08:46.361 --> 00:08:49.251
the Ottoman position, saw an opportunity:

00:08:50.141 --> 00:08:53.021
if they could convince the Arab tribes

00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:56.341
to rise up against their Ottoman rulers,

00:08:56.601 --> 00:08:58.991
it would divide the enemy’s forces

00:08:59.161 --> 00:09:01.461
and stretch their resources thin.

00:09:02.851 --> 00:09:05.821
The man at the centre of this idea was

00:09:05.861 --> 00:09:08.941
Sharif Hussein of Mecca, the ruler of

00:09:08.941 --> 00:09:11.871
the Hejaz, a region that included the two

00:09:11.881 --> 00:09:15.691
holiest cities in Islam—Mecca and Medina.

00:09:17.151 --> 00:09:20.021
Hussein had grown increasingly wary

00:09:20.221 --> 00:09:23.453
of Ottoman rule and had ambitions of

00:09:23.483 --> 00:09:26.303
establishing an independent Arab kingdom.

00:09:27.242 --> 00:09:29.417
And the British promised him

00:09:29.477 --> 00:09:32.027
exactly that, if he could

00:09:32.087 --> 00:09:33.837
overthrow the Ottomans, that was.

00:09:35.097 --> 00:09:37.937
In 1915, there was a series of

00:09:37.937 --> 00:09:40.407
letters exchanged between Sharif

00:09:40.407 --> 00:09:42.327
Hussein and the British High

00:09:42.327 --> 00:09:44.787
Commissioner in Egypt, Henry McMahon.

00:09:46.047 --> 00:09:49.227
In these letters, McMahon seemed to

00:09:49.227 --> 00:09:52.517
confirm that if the Arabs helped to

00:09:52.557 --> 00:09:54.687
overthrow the Ottomans, they would be

00:09:54.687 --> 00:09:57.537
granted their own independent state.

00:09:58.767 --> 00:10:00.397
And so, it began.

00:10:01.147 --> 00:10:04.847
In 1916, Hussein’s forces, led in large

00:10:04.847 --> 00:10:08.037
part by his son Prince Faisal, launched

00:10:08.047 --> 00:10:10.347
attacks against Ottoman garrisons.

00:10:11.017 --> 00:10:13.537
But it was not a smooth campaign.

00:10:14.147 --> 00:10:17.137
The Arab forces were desert warriors,

00:10:17.447 --> 00:10:19.967
skilled at a certain type of warfare,

00:10:20.157 --> 00:10:22.557
where horses and swords were involved,

00:10:22.907 --> 00:10:25.827
but they were bitterly unprepared for a

00:10:25.837 --> 00:10:29.097
war fought by machine guns and artillery.

00:10:30.137 --> 00:10:32.717
What’s more, they lacked unity.

00:10:33.517 --> 00:10:36.277
Many tribes were reluctant to join

00:10:36.277 --> 00:10:38.327
the revolt, suspicious of British

00:10:38.357 --> 00:10:41.047
intentions or unwilling to commit

00:10:41.177 --> 00:10:43.347
without clear guarantees of victory.

00:10:44.457 --> 00:10:46.247
This was where Lawrence

00:10:46.447 --> 00:10:47.337
entered the picture.

00:10:48.337 --> 00:10:50.350
By this point, he had itchy

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:52.060
feet from sitting at his

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:54.580
relatively cushy Cairo desk job.

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:57.770
Two of his younger brothers had been

00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:00.080
killed in the bloody battlefields

00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:02.710
of northern France, and he felt

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:04.810
a deep sense of guilt that he

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:06.150
hadn’t really done anything.

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:09.603
He was ready, and he jumped at the

00:11:09.603 --> 00:11:11.853
opportunity to get closer to the action.

00:11:12.613 --> 00:11:15.613
He was sent from Cairo to meet Prince

00:11:15.623 --> 00:11:17.853
Faisal in person, to assess the

00:11:17.863 --> 00:11:20.793
situation and determine how Britain

00:11:21.003 --> 00:11:23.623
could best support the Arab fighters.

00:11:24.403 --> 00:11:26.313
What he found was a movement

00:11:26.333 --> 00:11:28.683
that was full of ambition but

00:11:29.023 --> 00:11:31.143
lacking a defined strategy.

00:11:32.063 --> 00:11:34.323
The Arab forces had the advantage of

00:11:34.323 --> 00:11:36.723
mobility, knowledge of the terrain,

00:11:36.923 --> 00:11:39.593
and motivation, but they lacked

00:11:39.623 --> 00:11:41.703
the heavy weaponry, discipline,

00:11:41.933 --> 00:11:44.263
and resources of the Ottoman army.

00:11:45.063 --> 00:11:47.223
Lawrence believed the Arabs

00:11:47.423 --> 00:11:49.423
needed a new way of fighting.

00:11:49.963 --> 00:11:52.143
They could not win a conventional

00:11:52.143 --> 00:11:53.393
war against the Ottomans.

00:11:53.593 --> 00:11:54.613
They didn’t have the

00:11:54.613 --> 00:11:56.433
numbers or the weapons.

00:11:57.113 --> 00:11:59.523
Instead, they needed to wage

00:11:59.753 --> 00:12:02.383
guerrilla warfare—hit-and-run attacks,

00:12:02.703 --> 00:12:05.453
sabotage and psychological pressure.

00:12:06.543 --> 00:12:09.473
Rather than trying to hold and defend

00:12:09.503 --> 00:12:12.113
territory, they would move like the

00:12:12.113 --> 00:12:14.373
desert itself, appearing suddenly,

00:12:14.703 --> 00:12:17.270
striking hard, and disappearing

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:19.580
before the enemy could retaliate.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:22.540
Faisal listened.

00:12:23.397 --> 00:12:25.167
He seemed to understand that

00:12:25.177 --> 00:12:27.577
Lawrence, unlike most of his fellow

00:12:27.577 --> 00:12:29.657
British officers, was not trying

00:12:29.657 --> 00:12:32.077
to command the Arabs but rather

00:12:32.387 --> 00:12:34.907
to advise them in their own fight.

00:12:36.337 --> 00:12:39.507
A strange friendship developed between

00:12:39.507 --> 00:12:41.647
the British officer and the Arab

00:12:41.657 --> 00:12:44.737
prince—two men from entirely different

00:12:44.737 --> 00:12:48.417
worlds, but seemingly united by a

00:12:48.417 --> 00:12:51.107
shared vision of Arab independence.

00:12:51.807 --> 00:12:54.207
Lawrence abandoned his British

00:12:54.207 --> 00:12:57.147
uniform, and instead dressed in flowing

00:12:57.147 --> 00:12:59.347
white robes like an Arab sheikh.

00:13:00.187 --> 00:13:02.827
It was partly practicality—the

00:13:02.827 --> 00:13:04.707
robes were more suited to the

00:13:04.707 --> 00:13:07.347
desert—but it was also a symbol.

00:13:08.027 --> 00:13:09.607
He was not just an outsider

00:13:10.027 --> 00:13:11.757
observing the revolt.

00:13:11.987 --> 00:13:13.087
He was part of it.

00:13:14.327 --> 00:13:17.367
He fought alongside the Arab soldiers, not

00:13:17.367 --> 00:13:20.647
just hanging back sipping tea and advising

00:13:20.647 --> 00:13:23.396
the prince, but on the frontlines,

00:13:23.577 --> 00:13:25.767
leading guerilla missions, setting off

00:13:25.777 --> 00:13:28.677
explosives, and getting involved in a

00:13:28.687 --> 00:13:31.217
far more active way than he was meant to.

00:13:31.947 --> 00:13:33.757
Remember, he had been sent to be

00:13:33.757 --> 00:13:35.897
an informal advisor to the prince;

00:13:36.187 --> 00:13:37.727
he hadn’t been sent to fight.

00:13:38.987 --> 00:13:41.557
And although he wasn’t a soldier

00:13:41.827 --> 00:13:44.827
by training, he seemed to have a

00:13:44.827 --> 00:13:47.227
natural sense of military strategy.

00:13:48.447 --> 00:13:50.077
Perhaps the most famous

00:13:50.097 --> 00:13:52.867
example of this was with Aqaba.

00:13:54.167 --> 00:13:56.667
The port of Aqaba, on the Red Sea,

00:13:56.857 --> 00:13:59.217
was a vital Ottoman stronghold.

00:13:59.717 --> 00:14:01.747
It was heavily defended from

00:14:01.747 --> 00:14:03.367
the sea, where the Ottomans

00:14:03.387 --> 00:14:05.047
expected any attack to come.

00:14:05.683 --> 00:14:08.717
But Lawrence had a different plan.

00:14:09.487 --> 00:14:11.017
Instead of attacking from the

00:14:11.017 --> 00:14:14.207
water, he proposed an impossible

00:14:14.207 --> 00:14:17.597
route—crossing the deadly Nefud Desert

00:14:17.717 --> 00:14:20.317
and attacking Aqaba from behind.

00:14:21.447 --> 00:14:23.117
The journey was brutal.

00:14:23.617 --> 00:14:26.146
Lawrence, Faisal’s fighters, and

00:14:26.146 --> 00:14:28.613
the fearsome Bedouin cavalry, led

00:14:28.613 --> 00:14:31.167
by a fierce warrior named Auda abu

00:14:31.167 --> 00:14:34.195
Tayi, crossed nearly 1000 kilometres

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:36.030
of some of the harshest terrain

00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:38.290
on Earth, suffering from thirst,

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:41.100
exhaustion, and the relentless heat.

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:44.830
When they finally reached Aqaba in July of

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:48.100
1917, coming from the desert in the north

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:51.020
rather than by sea in the south, they

00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:53.610
took the Ottoman defenders by surprise.

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:55.880
The garrison collapsed.

00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:58.810
Some defenders fled into the sea in panic.

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:01.160
It was a stunning victory.

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:04.390
Aqaba was a turning point.

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:07.260
It gave the Arab forces a port for

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.980
supplies, a symbolic victory, and

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:12.420
credibility on the world stage.

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:15.600
Lawrence rode for days through

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:17.570
the desert to deliver the news

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:19.380
to British commanders in Cairo.

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:22.916
He arrived, sunburned, half-starved,

00:15:22.986 --> 00:15:25.936
and covered in dust, but triumphant.

00:15:26.846 --> 00:15:29.436
However, the war was not over.

00:15:30.046 --> 00:15:32.491
After Aqaba, Lawrence and the Arab

00:15:32.501 --> 00:15:34.871
forces turned their focus to the

00:15:34.871 --> 00:15:37.401
Hejaz Railway, which was the lifeline

00:15:37.561 --> 00:15:39.401
of the Ottoman forces in the region.

00:15:40.401 --> 00:15:42.541
Instead of trying to capture

00:15:42.541 --> 00:15:45.131
cities, they attacked the railway

00:15:45.131 --> 00:15:48.011
itself, derailing trains, blowing

00:15:48.011 --> 00:15:50.541
up bridges, and planting mines.

00:15:51.089 --> 00:15:53.429
It was a war of sabotage.

00:15:53.849 --> 00:15:56.049
The Ottomans could never be sure

00:15:56.239 --> 00:15:57.999
where the next attack would come.

00:15:59.269 --> 00:16:01.499
And it was during one of these

00:16:01.499 --> 00:16:03.639
missions that Lawrence experienced

00:16:03.779 --> 00:16:05.449
the darkest moment of his life.

00:16:06.209 --> 00:16:09.619
In late 1917, he traveled in

00:16:09.619 --> 00:16:12.777
disguise to the town of Deraa, deep

00:16:12.997 --> 00:16:14.847
in Ottoman-controlled territory.

00:16:15.947 --> 00:16:18.757
He was dressed as an Arab and attempting

00:16:18.757 --> 00:16:20.627
to gather intelligence when he was

00:16:20.687 --> 00:16:23.539
captured by Ottoman forces and brought

00:16:23.569 --> 00:16:26.039
before the local governor, Hajim Bey.

00:16:27.429 --> 00:16:29.899
In his own account, Lawrence wrote

00:16:30.119 --> 00:16:32.839
that he was beaten, tortured, and

00:16:32.849 --> 00:16:34.939
sexually assaulted by his captors.

00:16:36.049 --> 00:16:37.419
He was eventually released,

00:16:37.779 --> 00:16:39.559
most probably because he never

00:16:39.559 --> 00:16:41.429
revealed his true identity.

00:16:42.229 --> 00:16:45.019
Had he done so, and had he been

00:16:45.089 --> 00:16:48.494
unmasked as the notorious “El Aurens,”

00:16:48.669 --> 00:16:50.309
as the Arabs called him, he would

00:16:50.339 --> 00:16:52.369
almost certainly have been shot.

00:16:53.679 --> 00:16:56.789
Now, this makes for a great story, and

00:16:57.009 --> 00:16:58.979
it is a particularly good part of the

00:16:58.979 --> 00:17:02.869
movie, but its truth is somewhat debated.

00:17:03.459 --> 00:17:06.079
The only account of it comes from Lawrence

00:17:06.079 --> 00:17:09.399
himself, and he was prone to exaggeration.

00:17:10.223 --> 00:17:12.633
What really happened, if anything,

00:17:12.903 --> 00:17:15.063
will most likely never be known.

00:17:15.913 --> 00:17:19.223
But what is clear is that something

00:17:19.253 --> 00:17:21.723
changed in Lawrence after Deraa.

00:17:22.683 --> 00:17:25.423
He became more ruthless in battle.

00:17:25.903 --> 00:17:28.113
He authorised brutal reprisals

00:17:28.313 --> 00:17:30.543
against Ottoman troops, including

00:17:30.733 --> 00:17:32.413
the execution of prisoners.

00:17:33.513 --> 00:17:35.803
Some of his Arab allies noticed

00:17:35.803 --> 00:17:37.573
the shift—he was no longer

00:17:37.903 --> 00:17:40.473
just a strategist and diplomat.

00:17:40.763 --> 00:17:42.456
He was a man who had been

00:17:42.456 --> 00:17:44.883
broken and rebuilt by war.

00:17:46.013 --> 00:17:49.743
By 1918, Arab forces, alongside

00:17:49.743 --> 00:17:52.003
the British, reached Damascus.

00:17:52.483 --> 00:17:54.383
The Ottomans were in retreat.

00:17:54.783 --> 00:17:56.813
Lawrence rode into the city

00:17:57.043 --> 00:17:58.703
alongside Faisal’s men.

00:17:59.323 --> 00:18:00.993
It was supposed to be the

00:18:00.993 --> 00:18:03.643
moment of Arab independence.

00:18:04.773 --> 00:18:05.413
It was not.

00:18:06.593 --> 00:18:08.663
While Lawrence had been fighting in the

00:18:08.663 --> 00:18:12.202
desert, diplomats in London and Paris had

00:18:12.232 --> 00:18:14.962
already divided the Middle East without

00:18:15.032 --> 00:18:17.642
any consultation of any of its leaders.

00:18:18.592 --> 00:18:21.572
This was a secret deal signed in

00:18:21.582 --> 00:18:24.612
1916, the Sykes-Picot Agreement,

00:18:24.852 --> 00:18:26.982
in which the British and the French

00:18:27.342 --> 00:18:29.492
carved up the region after the

00:18:29.502 --> 00:18:31.902
inevitable fall of the Ottoman Empire.

00:18:33.402 --> 00:18:35.512
The French would take Syria and

00:18:35.512 --> 00:18:37.592
Lebanon, while Britain would

00:18:37.592 --> 00:18:40.632
control Iraq, Jordan, and Palestine.

00:18:41.722 --> 00:18:43.392
Arab independence was

00:18:43.402 --> 00:18:45.032
never part of the deal.

00:18:46.202 --> 00:18:48.292
Now, here’s where it gets a little

00:18:48.292 --> 00:18:50.962
more complicated for T.E. Lawrence,

00:18:51.142 --> 00:18:53.476
the supposed flag carrier and chief

00:18:53.476 --> 00:18:56.086
proponent of an Arab liberation movement.

00:18:56.886 --> 00:18:59.166
Lawrence knew about the

00:18:59.166 --> 00:19:00.326
Sykes-Picot Agreement.

00:19:01.206 --> 00:19:03.936
It’s not clear exactly how much

00:19:03.936 --> 00:19:06.176
he knew, perhaps not all the

00:19:06.176 --> 00:19:08.706
details, but it's highly likely

00:19:08.896 --> 00:19:10.816
that he knew of its existence.

00:19:11.756 --> 00:19:13.846
While apparently promising Prince

00:19:13.846 --> 00:19:16.656
Faisal one thing, and earning his

00:19:16.686 --> 00:19:20.476
deep trust and respect, he knew that

00:19:20.476 --> 00:19:23.626
politicians back in London and Paris had

00:19:23.636 --> 00:19:26.276
no plans of honouring this agreement.

00:19:27.106 --> 00:19:29.736
The promises in the exchange of letters

00:19:30.016 --> 00:19:32.796
had been kept deliberately vague on the

00:19:32.796 --> 00:19:34.936
part of the British, giving the Arabs

00:19:34.936 --> 00:19:37.596
the idea that they were firm promises

00:19:37.926 --> 00:19:40.276
but leaving room for the British to hold

00:19:40.276 --> 00:19:42.766
up their hands later on and say “oh no,

00:19:42.766 --> 00:19:44.546
no, that’s not at all what we meant”.

00:19:45.796 --> 00:19:49.126
The Arabs were to be used, plain and

00:19:49.126 --> 00:19:51.656
simple, and once they had done their

00:19:51.656 --> 00:19:54.179
job and caused enough disruption to

00:19:54.179 --> 00:19:56.479
the Ottomans, they would be discarded.

00:19:57.869 --> 00:20:00.959
Now, although Lawrence knew about this,

00:20:01.299 --> 00:20:03.859
it seems that he had tried to ignore it.

00:20:04.579 --> 00:20:06.639
Perhaps he hoped that by the time

00:20:06.639 --> 00:20:09.129
the war ended, and it was clear how

00:20:09.129 --> 00:20:11.699
important this Arab revolt had been,

00:20:12.229 --> 00:20:14.619
Britain would have no choice but to

00:20:14.669 --> 00:20:16.719
honour its promises to the Arabs.

00:20:17.789 --> 00:20:20.789
But things did not turn out that way.

00:20:21.579 --> 00:20:24.119
When Damascus fell, Faisal was

00:20:24.119 --> 00:20:26.429
declared king of Syria—but the

00:20:26.429 --> 00:20:28.829
French soon removed him by force.

00:20:29.332 --> 00:20:31.649
The Arab kingdom Lawrence had fought

00:20:31.649 --> 00:20:34.429
for vanished almost immediately.

00:20:35.639 --> 00:20:36.619
He was devastated.

00:20:37.219 --> 00:20:39.839
He returned to Britain a broken man.

00:20:40.469 --> 00:20:42.962
He refused a knighthood, turned down

00:20:42.972 --> 00:20:46.212
honours, and withdrew from public life.

00:20:46.932 --> 00:20:49.652
He changed his name, enlisted in the

00:20:49.652 --> 00:20:52.482
Royal Air Force under a false identity,

00:20:53.092 --> 00:20:55.452
and lived the rest of his life in

00:20:55.452 --> 00:20:58.842
a self-imposed exile in a 60-metre

00:20:58.842 --> 00:21:00.782
square cottage in the countryside.

00:21:02.282 --> 00:21:06.162
In 1935, at the age of 46, he

00:21:06.172 --> 00:21:08.282
died in a motorcycle accident.

00:21:09.302 --> 00:21:11.832
Some say he was running from the past,

00:21:12.162 --> 00:21:14.692
from the weight of broken promises.

00:21:15.542 --> 00:21:17.882
Others see him as a tragic figure,

00:21:18.262 --> 00:21:20.262
a man who tried to shape history

00:21:20.622 --> 00:21:23.272
but was ultimately powerless against

00:21:23.282 --> 00:21:26.002
the forces of empire and diplomacy.

00:21:27.192 --> 00:21:28.562
And the Middle East he left

00:21:28.562 --> 00:21:31.002
behind, to state the obvious, was

00:21:31.002 --> 00:21:33.142
not the one he had envisioned.

00:21:33.812 --> 00:21:35.882
The borders drawn by Sykes and

00:21:35.882 --> 00:21:38.642
Picot still shape the region today.

00:21:39.352 --> 00:21:41.402
The struggle for Arab independence

00:21:41.442 --> 00:21:44.482
continued for decades, and resentment

00:21:44.672 --> 00:21:47.202
towards Western involvement never faded.

00:21:48.222 --> 00:21:50.742
To this day, T.E. Lawrence is

00:21:50.742 --> 00:21:52.162
remembered in different ways.

00:21:52.962 --> 00:21:56.532
In Britain, to most he is a romantic

00:21:56.532 --> 00:21:58.892
figure, a daring adventurer.

00:21:59.732 --> 00:22:01.972
In the Arab world, he is a more

00:22:02.022 --> 00:22:05.412
ambiguous symbol—to some, a hero

00:22:05.412 --> 00:22:08.062
who fought for Arab independence; to

00:22:08.062 --> 00:22:11.082
others, a man who, knowingly or not,

00:22:11.402 --> 00:22:13.602
played a role in one of the greatest

00:22:13.612 --> 00:22:15.712
betrayals of the modern Middle East.

00:22:16.652 --> 00:22:19.732
He is nothing if not impressive, and

00:22:19.982 --> 00:22:22.132
to end this episode, I will leave

00:22:22.132 --> 00:22:24.642
you with a quote from the man which I

00:22:24.682 --> 00:22:27.192
think sums up his sense of adventure.

00:22:28.262 --> 00:22:31.162
“All men dream: but not equally.

00:22:31.572 --> 00:22:34.632
Those who dream by night in the dusty

00:22:34.632 --> 00:22:37.042
recesses of their minds wake up in

00:22:37.042 --> 00:22:40.112
the day to find it was vanity, but

00:22:40.542 --> 00:22:43.002
the dreamers of the day are dangerous

00:22:43.002 --> 00:22:46.082
men, for they may act their dreams

00:22:46.082 --> 00:22:49.332
with open eyes, to make it possible.”

00:22:51.302 --> 00:22:53.782
OK then, that is it for today's

00:22:53.782 --> 00:22:56.282
episode on T.E. Lawrence, otherwise

00:22:56.282 --> 00:22:58.162
known as Lawrence of Arabia.

00:22:58.612 --> 00:22:59.872
I hope it's been an interesting one,

00:23:00.262 --> 00:23:01.892
and that you've learnt something new.

00:23:02.428 --> 00:23:04.066
As always, I would love to know

00:23:04.076 --> 00:23:05.276
what you thought about this episode.

00:23:05.566 --> 00:23:07.386
We have lots of listeners from all

00:23:07.426 --> 00:23:10.066
over the Middle East, so tell me, what

00:23:10.076 --> 00:23:12.176
do you know and think about this man?

00:23:12.676 --> 00:23:15.726
Hero, villain, or somewhere in the middle?

00:23:16.106 --> 00:23:18.126
I would love to know, so if you’re

00:23:18.126 --> 00:23:19.686
listening to this somewhere you can

then now’s the time to get doing that.

00:23:25.236 --> 00:23:27.586
