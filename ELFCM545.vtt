Hello, hello, hello, and welcome

00:00:08.033 --> 00:00:10.023
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:10.023 --> 00:00:12.993
Minds, by Leonardo English, the show

00:00:13.153 --> 00:00:14.913
where you can listen to fascinating

00:00:14.913 --> 00:00:17.383
stories and learn weird and wonderful

00:00:17.393 --> 00:00:19.463
things about the world at the same

00:00:19.463 --> 00:00:21.333
time as improving your English.

00:00:21.833 --> 00:00:24.253
I'm Alastair Budge, and today,

00:00:24.413 --> 00:00:26.373
is the start of yet another

00:00:26.443 --> 00:00:27.973
three-part mini-series.

00:00:28.193 --> 00:00:31.743
This one is on the topic of World War I.

00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:33.823
But we aren’t really going to

00:00:33.823 --> 00:00:35.733
talk all that much about World

00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:37.936
War I, at least not directly.

00:00:38.506 --> 00:00:40.896
Instead, we are going to explore

00:00:40.906 --> 00:00:43.126
this period through the lives of

00:00:43.186 --> 00:00:45.526
unusual characters involved in the

00:00:45.526 --> 00:00:47.996
war, some more directly than others.

00:00:48.416 --> 00:00:52.166
So, in today’s episode, part one, we

00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:54.036
are going to talk about the amazing

00:00:54.036 --> 00:00:57.556
story of T.E. Lawrence, the British

00:00:57.596 --> 00:00:59.916
archaeologist and army officer who

00:00:59.916 --> 00:01:02.226
fought alongside Arabian tribesmen

00:01:02.476 --> 00:01:05.326
for a united Arab nation, all

00:01:05.426 --> 00:01:07.376
while harbouring a guilty secret.

00:01:08.146 --> 00:01:10.996
Next up, in part two, we’ll learn about

00:01:11.006 --> 00:01:14.236
the story of Mata Hari, the Dutch woman

00:01:14.396 --> 00:01:17.036
who became an exotic dancer and the talk

00:01:17.036 --> 00:01:19.786
of Paris, before being executed by a

00:01:19.796 --> 00:01:22.876
firing squad on the charge of being a spy.

00:01:23.156 --> 00:01:25.106
And in part three, in the interests

00:01:25.116 --> 00:01:27.836
of balance, we will talk about Manfred

00:01:27.836 --> 00:01:30.206
von Richthofen, a German aircraft

00:01:30.246 --> 00:01:32.946
pilot so deadly he was known to his

00:01:32.946 --> 00:01:36.546
enemies as “The Red Baron”. OK then,

00:01:36.796 --> 00:01:39.986
let’s get right into it and learn about

00:01:39.996 --> 00:01:43.836
the unlikely life of T.E. Lawrence.

00:01:45.496 --> 00:01:48.476
A title you will often find in lists

00:01:48.506 --> 00:01:51.196
of “The Greatest Films Ever Made” is

00:01:51.196 --> 00:01:55.426
the 1962 classic “Lawrence of Arabia”.

00:01:56.226 --> 00:01:58.986
The trailer for the film opens with

00:01:58.996 --> 00:02:02.106
wide-angle shots of a man trekking

00:02:02.116 --> 00:02:04.656
through a vast desert on a camel.

00:02:05.556 --> 00:02:08.756
As the camel obediently plods forward,

00:02:09.106 --> 00:02:10.986
putting one foot in front of the

00:02:10.986 --> 00:02:13.416
other in the scorching desert sand,

00:02:13.896 --> 00:02:15.856
you hear the words of the narrator,

00:02:16.396 --> 00:02:18.976
ostensibly about the man on the camel.

00:02:20.166 --> 00:02:23.346
He says, “I deem him one of the

00:02:23.346 --> 00:02:25.796
greatest beings alive in our time.

00:02:26.276 --> 00:02:28.986
His name will live in history. It

00:02:28.986 --> 00:02:31.869
will live in the annals of war…it

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:34.599
will live in the legends of Arabia.”

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:37.749
The quote is attributed

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:39.279
to Winston Churchill.

00:02:40.113 --> 00:02:42.559
Immediately, the viewer is hooked.

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:45.419
If Churchill, the great wartime

00:02:45.429 --> 00:02:48.449
leader, is calling this man “one of

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:50.669
the greatest beings alive in our time”,

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:53.809
well, that certainly is something.

00:02:55.126 --> 00:02:56.996
The trailer continues, with the

00:02:56.996 --> 00:03:00.386
narrator going on to say that “no man

00:03:00.386 --> 00:03:03.486
of our time has drawn upon himself so

00:03:03.486 --> 00:03:06.236
much praise and so much criticism”.

00:03:07.556 --> 00:03:09.736
It is a fair assessment, but

00:03:09.986 --> 00:03:12.266
now we must move from talking

00:03:12.306 --> 00:03:14.726
about the movie to the real man.

00:03:16.266 --> 00:03:20.546
Thomas Edward Lawrence was born in 1888

00:03:20.846 --> 00:03:24.536
in north Wales, the second of five sons.

00:03:25.206 --> 00:03:27.936
He was a shy but passionate boy.

00:03:28.596 --> 00:03:29.946
When he set his mind to

00:03:29.946 --> 00:03:31.516
something, he did it.

00:03:32.476 --> 00:03:34.936
And from an early age he was

00:03:34.966 --> 00:03:36.686
passionate about history.

00:03:37.446 --> 00:03:40.176
When he was 15, he spent the summer

00:03:40.416 --> 00:03:43.366
cycling around a large area of southern

00:03:43.376 --> 00:03:45.606
England with a friend, visiting

00:03:45.676 --> 00:03:48.106
every single church he came across.

00:03:48.746 --> 00:03:51.366
The boys took notes, made rubbings

00:03:51.366 --> 00:03:54.156
of brass memorials, and when they had

00:03:54.156 --> 00:03:56.606
finished, they presented their findings

00:03:56.846 --> 00:03:59.196
to the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford.

00:04:00.586 --> 00:04:02.766
As you might imagine, the museum’s

00:04:02.766 --> 00:04:05.786
curators were astounded and impressed

00:04:05.986 --> 00:04:07.776
by the boys’ attention to detail.

00:04:09.056 --> 00:04:11.706
And this wasn’t a one-off.

00:04:12.066 --> 00:04:14.856
The teenage boy had got the bug, he

00:04:14.856 --> 00:04:17.346
had had a small taste of adventure.

00:04:18.246 --> 00:04:20.426
Later that summer, he cycled

00:04:20.446 --> 00:04:22.806
around France on his own, visiting

00:04:22.816 --> 00:04:25.096
medieval castles and taking notes.

00:04:25.506 --> 00:04:28.286
Then he did the same thing again the

00:04:28.286 --> 00:04:31.706
following summer, still aged only 16.

00:04:32.726 --> 00:04:35.596
This clear passion for understanding

00:04:35.606 --> 00:04:38.256
the past earned him a place at Oxford

00:04:38.256 --> 00:04:41.316
University, where he read history, and

00:04:41.626 --> 00:04:45.366
for his thesis, he went one step further.

00:04:46.476 --> 00:04:49.656
In his last year at university, and aged

00:04:49.696 --> 00:04:53.006
only 20, he embarked on a three-month

00:04:53.026 --> 00:04:56.099
trip to Syria to study castles of the

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:59.099
crusader era, so medieval castles.

00:04:59.749 --> 00:05:02.949
Now, even putting aside the more recent

00:05:02.999 --> 00:05:04.609
political instability in the region,

00:05:05.109 --> 00:05:08.239
even in the 21st century, Syria is

00:05:08.239 --> 00:05:10.369
not the easiest country to get around.

00:05:10.989 --> 00:05:14.818
But Lawrence visited in 1909,

00:05:15.239 --> 00:05:17.269
and he was going from abandoned

00:05:17.269 --> 00:05:18.899
castle to abandoned castle.

00:05:19.339 --> 00:05:20.879
There was practically no

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:23.229
infrastructure, no way of getting

00:05:23.239 --> 00:05:24.929
from one castle to the next.

00:05:25.269 --> 00:05:28.239
So…he mostly walked and rode on

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:30.579
donkeys, claiming to have travelled

00:05:30.579 --> 00:05:34.359
a grand total of 1,600 kilometres.

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:37.379
He had already developed a keen

00:05:37.399 --> 00:05:40.379
interest in the Middle East, but this

00:05:40.399 --> 00:05:42.839
trip really took it to a new level.

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:47.149
And this area, I should add, was

00:05:47.149 --> 00:05:49.009
still part of the Ottoman Empire.

00:05:49.329 --> 00:05:52.159
There was no Syria, no Lebanon,

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:54.469
no Jordan, this was all part of

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:56.319
the sprawling Ottoman Empire.

00:05:57.129 --> 00:05:59.089
And this will be of vital

00:05:59.109 --> 00:06:01.289
importance to the rest of our story.

00:06:02.119 --> 00:06:06.789
So, in 1910, at the age of 22, Thomas

00:06:06.819 --> 00:06:10.039
Lawrence graduated, and like any fresh

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:12.609
graduate, he was in the market for a job.

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:15.399
Clearly not any job, though.

00:06:15.899 --> 00:06:17.369
It would have to involve some

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:19.509
form of exploring the past,

00:06:19.809 --> 00:06:21.589
preferably in the Middle East.

00:06:22.437 --> 00:06:24.712
And sure enough, he did not become

00:06:24.712 --> 00:06:27.202
a lawyer or an accountant; he

00:06:27.202 --> 00:06:29.632
found a job as an archaeologist.

00:06:30.312 --> 00:06:32.052
He worked across the Middle

00:06:32.052 --> 00:06:33.962
East, in modern-day Lebanon,

00:06:34.262 --> 00:06:36.822
Syria, Israel and Egypt.

00:06:38.032 --> 00:06:40.951
And he seemed different from

00:06:40.951 --> 00:06:42.211
most of the other Western

00:06:42.211 --> 00:06:44.631
archaeologists exploring the area.

00:06:45.301 --> 00:06:47.591
He studied Arabic, and spoke

00:06:47.591 --> 00:06:49.001
it practically fluently.

00:06:49.471 --> 00:06:52.161
He was actually interested in the language

00:06:52.161 --> 00:06:54.191
and culture of the people living there,

00:06:54.621 --> 00:06:57.171
whereas most of his fellow archaeologists

00:06:57.441 --> 00:06:59.561
believed they were there to teach;

00:06:59.601 --> 00:07:01.411
there was nothing they could learn

00:07:01.411 --> 00:07:04.171
from these backwards “desert people”.

00:07:05.391 --> 00:07:08.717
Now, fast forward to 1914.

00:07:09.401 --> 00:07:12.071
The assassination of Archduke Franz

00:07:12.071 --> 00:07:14.041
Ferdinand of Austria, in the now

00:07:14.051 --> 00:07:16.721
Bosnian capital of Sarajevo, had

00:07:16.751 --> 00:07:19.201
ripple effects that extended all

00:07:19.201 --> 00:07:21.151
the way to the Arabian desert.

00:07:22.271 --> 00:07:25.051
As you may know, or remember from

00:07:25.051 --> 00:07:27.011
our last mini-series on the theme

00:07:27.011 --> 00:07:28.751
of the fall of the Ottoman Empire,

00:07:29.191 --> 00:07:31.951
the Ottomans sided with Germany.

00:07:33.011 --> 00:07:36.411
Suddenly, this vast swathe of territory

00:07:36.431 --> 00:07:38.511
in the Middle East was the enemy.

00:07:39.781 --> 00:07:42.961
Lawrence was sent to Egypt, which was

00:07:43.021 --> 00:07:44.501
under the rule of the British at the

00:07:44.501 --> 00:07:47.531
time, where he was tasked with making

00:07:47.531 --> 00:07:49.881
sense of what was going on in the region.

00:07:51.051 --> 00:07:53.191
He was, in many ways, the

00:07:53.231 --> 00:07:54.671
perfect man for the job.

00:07:55.271 --> 00:07:57.751
He spoke Arabic, he understood

00:07:57.751 --> 00:07:59.991
local customs and traditions, and

00:08:00.481 --> 00:08:02.881
he felt more at home in the Middle

00:08:02.881 --> 00:08:04.901
East than he did back in England.

00:08:05.781 --> 00:08:07.961
But at this stage, Lawrence

00:08:07.971 --> 00:08:10.141
was not yet a hero, not yet the

00:08:10.331 --> 00:08:12.091
legendary “Lawrence of Arabia.”

00:08:12.711 --> 00:08:15.251
He was simply a junior intelligence

00:08:15.281 --> 00:08:17.591
officer, working behind the scenes in

00:08:17.591 --> 00:08:20.401
Cairo, reading reports, interrogating

00:08:20.401 --> 00:08:22.451
prisoners, and trying to make

00:08:22.451 --> 00:08:25.261
sense of the complex tribal and

00:08:25.281 --> 00:08:27.001
political landscape of the region.

00:08:28.201 --> 00:08:30.101
And it was complex.

00:08:30.651 --> 00:08:33.211
The Ottoman Empire ruled over the Middle

00:08:33.211 --> 00:08:36.794
East, but its control was not absolute.

00:08:37.794 --> 00:08:40.524
In the deserts of Arabia, tribal leaders

00:08:40.614 --> 00:08:43.134
held enormous power, often ruling

00:08:43.184 --> 00:08:45.584
over their lands with little direct

00:08:45.594 --> 00:08:47.614
interference from Constantinople.

00:08:48.654 --> 00:08:51.344
The British, who were desperate to weaken

00:08:51.344 --> 00:08:54.234
the Ottoman position, saw an opportunity:

00:08:55.124 --> 00:08:58.004
if they could convince the Arab tribes

00:08:58.224 --> 00:09:01.324
to rise up against their Ottoman rulers,

00:09:01.584 --> 00:09:03.974
it would divide the enemy’s forces

00:09:04.144 --> 00:09:06.444
and stretch their resources thin.

00:09:07.834 --> 00:09:10.804
The man at the centre of this idea was

00:09:10.844 --> 00:09:13.924
Sharif Hussein of Mecca, the ruler of

00:09:13.924 --> 00:09:16.854
the Hejaz, a region that included the two

00:09:16.864 --> 00:09:20.674
holiest cities in Islam—Mecca and Medina.

00:09:22.134 --> 00:09:25.004
Hussein had grown increasingly wary

00:09:25.204 --> 00:09:28.436
of Ottoman rule and had ambitions of

00:09:28.466 --> 00:09:31.286
establishing an independent Arab kingdom.

00:09:32.225 --> 00:09:34.400
And the British promised him

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:37.010
exactly that, if he could

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:38.820
overthrow the Ottomans, that was.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.920
In 1915, there was a series of

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:45.390
letters exchanged between Sharif

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:47.310
Hussein and the British High

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:49.770
Commissioner in Egypt, Henry McMahon.

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:54.210
In these letters, McMahon seemed to

00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:57.500
confirm that if the Arabs helped to

00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:59.670
overthrow the Ottomans, they would be

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:02.520
granted their own independent state.

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:05.380
And so, it began.

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:09.830
In 1916, Hussein’s forces, led in large

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:13.020
part by his son Prince Faisal, launched

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:15.330
attacks against Ottoman garrisons.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.520
But it was not a smooth campaign.

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:22.120
The Arab forces were desert warriors,

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:24.950
skilled at a certain type of warfare,

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:27.540
where horses and swords were involved,

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:30.810
but they were bitterly unprepared for a

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:34.080
war fought by machine guns and artillery.

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:37.700
What’s more, they lacked unity.

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:41.260
Many tribes were reluctant to join

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.310
the revolt, suspicious of British

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:46.030
intentions or unwilling to commit

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.330
without clear guarantees of victory.

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.230
This was where Lawrence

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:52.320
entered the picture.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.333
By this point, he had itchy

00:10:55.333 --> 00:10:57.043
feet from sitting at his

00:10:57.043 --> 00:10:59.563
relatively cushy Cairo desk job.

00:11:00.333 --> 00:11:02.753
Two of his younger brothers had been

00:11:02.843 --> 00:11:05.063
killed in the bloody battlefields

00:11:05.073 --> 00:11:07.693
of northern France, and he felt

00:11:07.693 --> 00:11:09.793
a deep sense of guilt that he

00:11:09.793 --> 00:11:11.133
hadn’t really done anything.

00:11:11.773 --> 00:11:14.586
He was ready, and he jumped at the

00:11:14.586 --> 00:11:16.836
opportunity to get closer to the action.

00:11:17.596 --> 00:11:20.596
He was sent from Cairo to meet Prince

00:11:20.606 --> 00:11:22.836
Faisal in person, to assess the

00:11:22.846 --> 00:11:25.776
situation and determine how Britain

00:11:25.986 --> 00:11:28.606
could best support the Arab fighters.

00:11:29.386 --> 00:11:31.296
What he found was a movement

00:11:31.316 --> 00:11:33.666
that was full of ambition but

00:11:34.006 --> 00:11:36.126
lacking a defined strategy.

00:11:37.046 --> 00:11:39.306
The Arab forces had the advantage of

00:11:39.306 --> 00:11:41.706
mobility, knowledge of the terrain,

00:11:41.906 --> 00:11:44.576
and motivation, but they lacked

00:11:44.606 --> 00:11:46.686
the heavy weaponry, discipline,

00:11:46.916 --> 00:11:49.246
and resources of the Ottoman army.

00:11:50.046 --> 00:11:52.206
Lawrence believed the Arabs

00:11:52.406 --> 00:11:54.406
needed a new way of fighting.

00:11:54.946 --> 00:11:57.126
They could not win a conventional

00:11:57.126 --> 00:11:58.376
war against the Ottomans.

00:11:58.576 --> 00:11:59.596
They didn’t have the

00:11:59.596 --> 00:12:01.416
numbers or the weapons.

00:12:02.096 --> 00:12:04.506
Instead, they needed to wage

00:12:04.736 --> 00:12:07.366
guerrilla warfare—hit-and-run attacks,

00:12:07.686 --> 00:12:10.436
sabotage and psychological pressure.

00:12:11.526 --> 00:12:14.456
Rather than trying to hold and defend

00:12:14.486 --> 00:12:17.096
territory, they would move like the

00:12:17.096 --> 00:12:19.356
desert itself, appearing suddenly,

00:12:19.686 --> 00:12:22.253
striking hard, and disappearing

00:12:22.453 --> 00:12:24.563
before the enemy could retaliate.

00:12:25.723 --> 00:12:27.523
Faisal listened.

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:30.150
He seemed to understand that

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:32.560
Lawrence, unlike most of his fellow

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:34.640
British officers, was not trying

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:37.060
to command the Arabs but rather

00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:39.890
to advise them in their own fight.

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:44.490
A strange friendship developed between

00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:46.630
the British officer and the Arab

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:49.720
prince—two men from entirely different

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:53.400
worlds, but seemingly united by a

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:56.090
shared vision of Arab independence.

00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:59.190
Lawrence abandoned his British

00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:02.130
uniform, and instead dressed in flowing

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:04.330
white robes like an Arab sheikh.

00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:07.810
It was partly practicality—the

00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:09.690
robes were more suited to the

00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:12.330
desert—but it was also a symbol.

00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:14.590
He was not just an outsider

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:16.740
observing the revolt.

00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:18.070
He was part of it.

00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:22.350
He fought alongside the Arab soldiers, not

00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:25.630
just hanging back sipping tea and advising

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:28.380
the prince, but on the frontlines,

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:30.750
leading guerilla missions, setting off

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:33.660
explosives, and getting involved in a

00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:36.200
far more active way than he was meant to.

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:38.740
Remember, he had been sent to be

00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:40.880
an informal advisor to the prince;

00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:42.710
he hadn’t been sent to fight.

00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:46.540
And although he wasn’t a soldier

00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:49.810
by training, he seemed to have a

00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:52.210
natural sense of military strategy.

00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:55.060
Perhaps the most famous

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:57.850
example of this was with Aqaba.

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:01.650
The port of Aqaba, on the Red Sea,

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:04.200
was a vital Ottoman stronghold.

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:06.730
It was heavily defended from

00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:08.350
the sea, where the Ottomans

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:10.030
expected any attack to come.

00:14:10.666 --> 00:14:13.700
But Lawrence had a different plan.

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:16.000
Instead of attacking from the

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.190
water, he proposed an impossible

00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:22.580
route—crossing the deadly Nefud Desert

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:25.300
and attacking Aqaba from behind.

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:28.100
The journey was brutal.

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:31.130
Lawrence, Faisal’s fighters, and

00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:33.596
the fearsome Bedouin cavalry, led

00:14:33.596 --> 00:14:36.150
by a fierce warrior named Auda abu

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:39.178
Tayi, crossed nearly 1000 kilometres

00:14:39.253 --> 00:14:41.013
of some of the harshest terrain

00:14:41.013 --> 00:14:43.273
on Earth, suffering from thirst,

00:14:43.623 --> 00:14:46.083
exhaustion, and the relentless heat.

00:14:47.133 --> 00:14:49.813
When they finally reached Aqaba in July of

00:14:49.813 --> 00:14:53.083
1917, coming from the desert in the north

00:14:53.373 --> 00:14:56.003
rather than by sea in the south, they

00:14:56.003 --> 00:14:58.593
took the Ottoman defenders by surprise.

00:14:59.083 --> 00:15:00.863
The garrison collapsed.

00:15:00.963 --> 00:15:03.793
Some defenders fled into the sea in panic.

00:15:04.183 --> 00:15:06.143
It was a stunning victory.

00:15:07.353 --> 00:15:09.373
Aqaba was a turning point.

00:15:09.823 --> 00:15:12.243
It gave the Arab forces a port for

00:15:12.243 --> 00:15:14.963
supplies, a symbolic victory, and

00:15:15.013 --> 00:15:17.403
credibility on the world stage.

00:15:18.113 --> 00:15:20.583
Lawrence rode for days through

00:15:20.583 --> 00:15:22.553
the desert to deliver the news

00:15:22.663 --> 00:15:24.363
to British commanders in Cairo.

00:15:24.963 --> 00:15:27.899
He arrived, sunburned, half-starved,

00:15:27.969 --> 00:15:30.919
and covered in dust, but triumphant.

00:15:31.829 --> 00:15:34.419
However, the war was not over.

00:15:35.029 --> 00:15:37.474
After Aqaba, Lawrence and the Arab

00:15:37.484 --> 00:15:39.854
forces turned their focus to the

00:15:39.854 --> 00:15:42.384
Hejaz Railway, which was the lifeline

00:15:42.544 --> 00:15:44.384
of the Ottoman forces in the region.

00:15:45.384 --> 00:15:47.524
Instead of trying to capture

00:15:47.524 --> 00:15:50.114
cities, they attacked the railway

00:15:50.114 --> 00:15:52.994
itself, derailing trains, blowing

00:15:52.994 --> 00:15:55.524
up bridges, and planting mines.

00:15:56.072 --> 00:15:58.412
It was a war of sabotage.

00:15:58.832 --> 00:16:01.032
The Ottomans could never be sure

00:16:01.222 --> 00:16:02.982
where the next attack would come.

00:16:04.252 --> 00:16:06.482
And it was during one of these

00:16:06.482 --> 00:16:08.622
missions that Lawrence experienced

00:16:08.762 --> 00:16:10.432
the darkest moment of his life.

00:16:11.192 --> 00:16:14.602
In late 1917, he traveled in

00:16:14.602 --> 00:16:17.760
disguise to the town of Deraa, deep

00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:19.830
in Ottoman-controlled territory.

00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:23.740
He was dressed as an Arab and attempting

00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:25.610
to gather intelligence when he was

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:28.522
captured by Ottoman forces and brought

00:16:28.552 --> 00:16:31.022
before the local governor, Hajim Bey.

00:16:32.412 --> 00:16:34.882
In his own account, Lawrence wrote

00:16:35.102 --> 00:16:37.822
that he was beaten, tortured, and

00:16:37.832 --> 00:16:39.922
sexually assaulted by his captors.

00:16:41.032 --> 00:16:42.402
He was eventually released,

00:16:42.762 --> 00:16:44.542
most probably because he never

00:16:44.542 --> 00:16:46.412
revealed his true identity.

00:16:47.212 --> 00:16:50.002
Had he done so, and had he been

00:16:50.072 --> 00:16:53.478
unmasked as the notorious “El Aurens,”

00:16:53.652 --> 00:16:55.292
as the Arabs called him, he would

00:16:55.322 --> 00:16:57.352
almost certainly have been shot.

00:16:58.662 --> 00:17:01.772
Now, this makes for a great story, and

00:17:01.992 --> 00:17:03.962
it is a particularly good part of the

00:17:03.962 --> 00:17:07.852
movie, but its truth is somewhat debated.

00:17:08.442 --> 00:17:11.062
The only account of it comes from Lawrence

00:17:11.062 --> 00:17:14.382
himself, and he was prone to exaggeration.

00:17:15.206 --> 00:17:17.616
What really happened, if anything,

00:17:17.886 --> 00:17:20.046
will most likely never be known.

00:17:20.896 --> 00:17:24.206
But what is clear is that something

00:17:24.236 --> 00:17:26.706
changed in Lawrence after Deraa.

00:17:27.666 --> 00:17:30.406
He became more ruthless in battle.

00:17:30.886 --> 00:17:33.096
He authorised brutal reprisals

00:17:33.296 --> 00:17:35.526
against Ottoman troops, including

00:17:35.716 --> 00:17:37.396
the execution of prisoners.

00:17:38.496 --> 00:17:40.786
Some of his Arab allies noticed

00:17:40.786 --> 00:17:42.556
the shift—he was no longer

00:17:42.886 --> 00:17:45.456
just a strategist and diplomat.

00:17:45.746 --> 00:17:47.440
He was a man who had been

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:49.866
broken and rebuilt by war.

00:17:50.996 --> 00:17:54.726
By 1918, Arab forces, alongside

00:17:54.726 --> 00:17:56.986
the British, reached Damascus.

00:17:57.466 --> 00:17:59.366
The Ottomans were in retreat.

00:17:59.766 --> 00:18:01.796
Lawrence rode into the city

00:18:02.026 --> 00:18:03.686
alongside Faisal’s men.

00:18:04.306 --> 00:18:05.976
It was supposed to be the

00:18:05.976 --> 00:18:08.626
moment of Arab independence.

00:18:09.756 --> 00:18:10.396
It was not.

00:18:11.576 --> 00:18:13.646
While Lawrence had been fighting in the

00:18:13.646 --> 00:18:17.185
desert, diplomats in London and Paris had

00:18:17.215 --> 00:18:19.945
already divided the Middle East without

00:18:20.015 --> 00:18:22.625
any consultation of any of its leaders.

00:18:23.575 --> 00:18:26.555
This was a secret deal signed in

00:18:26.565 --> 00:18:29.595
1916, the Sykes-Picot Agreement,

00:18:29.835 --> 00:18:31.965
in which the British and the French

00:18:32.325 --> 00:18:34.475
carved up the region after the

00:18:34.485 --> 00:18:36.885
inevitable fall of the Ottoman Empire.

00:18:38.385 --> 00:18:40.495
The French would take Syria and

00:18:40.495 --> 00:18:42.575
Lebanon, while Britain would

00:18:42.575 --> 00:18:45.615
control Iraq, Jordan, and Palestine.

00:18:46.705 --> 00:18:48.375
Arab independence was

00:18:48.385 --> 00:18:50.015
never part of the deal.

00:18:51.185 --> 00:18:53.275
Now, here’s where it gets a little

00:18:53.275 --> 00:18:55.945
more complicated for T.E. Lawrence,

00:18:56.125 --> 00:18:58.459
the supposed flag carrier and chief

00:18:58.459 --> 00:19:01.069
proponent of an Arab liberation movement.

00:19:01.869 --> 00:19:04.149
Lawrence knew about the

00:19:04.149 --> 00:19:05.309
Sykes-Picot Agreement.

00:19:06.189 --> 00:19:08.919
It’s not clear exactly how much

00:19:08.919 --> 00:19:11.159
he knew, perhaps not all the

00:19:11.159 --> 00:19:13.689
details, but it's highly likely

00:19:13.879 --> 00:19:15.799
that he knew of its existence.

00:19:16.739 --> 00:19:18.829
While apparently promising Prince

00:19:18.829 --> 00:19:21.639
Faisal one thing, and earning his

00:19:21.669 --> 00:19:25.459
deep trust and respect, he knew that

00:19:25.459 --> 00:19:28.609
politicians back in London and Paris had

00:19:28.619 --> 00:19:31.259
no plans of honouring this agreement.

00:19:32.089 --> 00:19:34.719
The promises in the exchange of letters

00:19:34.999 --> 00:19:37.779
had been kept deliberately vague on the

00:19:37.779 --> 00:19:39.919
part of the British, giving the Arabs

00:19:39.919 --> 00:19:42.579
the idea that they were firm promises

00:19:42.909 --> 00:19:45.259
but leaving room for the British to hold

00:19:45.259 --> 00:19:47.749
up their hands later on and say “oh no,

00:19:47.749 --> 00:19:49.529
no, that’s not at all what we meant”.

00:19:50.779 --> 00:19:54.109
The Arabs were to be used, plain and

00:19:54.109 --> 00:19:56.639
simple, and once they had done their

00:19:56.639 --> 00:19:59.162
job and caused enough disruption to

00:19:59.162 --> 00:20:01.462
the Ottomans, they would be discarded.

00:20:02.852 --> 00:20:05.942
Now, although Lawrence knew about this,

00:20:06.282 --> 00:20:08.842
it seems that he had tried to ignore it.

00:20:09.562 --> 00:20:11.622
Perhaps he hoped that by the time

00:20:11.622 --> 00:20:14.112
the war ended, and it was clear how

00:20:14.112 --> 00:20:16.682
important this Arab revolt had been,

00:20:17.212 --> 00:20:19.602
Britain would have no choice but to

00:20:19.652 --> 00:20:21.702
honour its promises to the Arabs.

00:20:22.772 --> 00:20:25.772
But things did not turn out that way.

00:20:26.562 --> 00:20:29.102
When Damascus fell, Faisal was

00:20:29.102 --> 00:20:31.412
declared king of Syria—but the

00:20:31.412 --> 00:20:33.812
French soon removed him by force.

00:20:34.315 --> 00:20:36.632
The Arab kingdom Lawrence had fought

00:20:36.632 --> 00:20:39.412
for vanished almost immediately.

00:20:40.622 --> 00:20:41.602
He was devastated.

00:20:42.202 --> 00:20:44.822
He returned to Britain a broken man.

00:20:45.452 --> 00:20:47.945
He refused a knighthood, turned down

00:20:47.955 --> 00:20:51.195
honours, and withdrew from public life.

00:20:51.915 --> 00:20:54.635
He changed his name, enlisted in the

00:20:54.635 --> 00:20:57.465
Royal Air Force under a false identity,

00:20:58.075 --> 00:21:00.435
and lived the rest of his life in

00:21:00.435 --> 00:21:03.825
a self-imposed exile in a 60-metre

00:21:03.825 --> 00:21:05.765
square cottage in the countryside.

00:21:07.265 --> 00:21:11.145
In 1935, at the age of 46, he

00:21:11.155 --> 00:21:13.265
died in a motorcycle accident.

00:21:14.285 --> 00:21:16.815
Some say he was running from the past,

00:21:17.145 --> 00:21:19.675
from the weight of broken promises.

00:21:20.525 --> 00:21:22.865
Others see him as a tragic figure,

00:21:23.245 --> 00:21:25.245
a man who tried to shape history

00:21:25.605 --> 00:21:28.255
but was ultimately powerless against

00:21:28.265 --> 00:21:30.985
the forces of empire and diplomacy.

00:21:32.175 --> 00:21:33.545
And the Middle East he left

00:21:33.545 --> 00:21:35.985
behind, to state the obvious, was

00:21:35.985 --> 00:21:38.125
not the one he had envisioned.

00:21:38.795 --> 00:21:40.865
The borders drawn by Sykes and

00:21:40.865 --> 00:21:43.625
Picot still shape the region today.

00:21:44.335 --> 00:21:46.385
The struggle for Arab independence

00:21:46.425 --> 00:21:49.465
continued for decades, and resentment

00:21:49.655 --> 00:21:52.185
towards Western involvement never faded.

00:21:53.205 --> 00:21:55.725
To this day, T.E. Lawrence is

00:21:55.725 --> 00:21:57.145
remembered in different ways.

00:21:57.945 --> 00:22:01.515
In Britain, to most he is a romantic

00:22:01.515 --> 00:22:03.875
figure, a daring adventurer.

00:22:04.715 --> 00:22:06.955
In the Arab world, he is a more

00:22:07.005 --> 00:22:10.395
ambiguous symbol—to some, a hero

00:22:10.395 --> 00:22:13.045
who fought for Arab independence; to

00:22:13.045 --> 00:22:16.065
others, a man who, knowingly or not,

00:22:16.385 --> 00:22:18.585
played a role in one of the greatest

00:22:18.595 --> 00:22:20.695
betrayals of the modern Middle East.

00:22:21.635 --> 00:22:24.715
He is nothing if not impressive, and

00:22:24.965 --> 00:22:27.115
to end this episode, I will leave

00:22:27.115 --> 00:22:29.625
you with a quote from the man which I

00:22:29.665 --> 00:22:32.175
think sums up his sense of adventure.

00:22:33.245 --> 00:22:36.145
“All men dream: but not equally.

00:22:36.555 --> 00:22:39.615
Those who dream by night in the dusty

00:22:39.615 --> 00:22:42.025
recesses of their minds wake up in

00:22:42.025 --> 00:22:45.095
the day to find it was vanity, but

00:22:45.525 --> 00:22:47.985
the dreamers of the day are dangerous

00:22:47.985 --> 00:22:51.065
men, for they may act their dreams

00:22:51.065 --> 00:22:54.315
with open eyes, to make it possible.”

00:22:56.285 --> 00:22:58.765
OK then, that is it for today's

00:22:58.765 --> 00:23:01.265
episode on T.E. Lawrence, otherwise

00:23:01.265 --> 00:23:03.145
known as Lawrence of Arabia.

00:23:03.595 --> 00:23:04.855
I hope it's been an interesting one,

00:23:05.245 --> 00:23:06.875
and that you've learnt something new.

00:23:07.411 --> 00:23:09.049

00:23:09.059 --> 00:23:10.259
what you thought about this episode.

00:23:10.549 --> 00:23:12.369
We have lots of listeners from all

00:23:12.409 --> 00:23:15.049
over the Middle East, so tell me, what

00:23:15.059 --> 00:23:17.159
do you know and think about this man?

00:23:17.659 --> 00:23:20.709
Hero, villain, or somewhere in the middle?

00:23:21.089 --> 00:23:23.109
I would love to know, so if you’re

00:23:23.109 --> 00:23:24.669

then now’s the time to get doing that.

00:23:30.219 --> 00:23:32.569
