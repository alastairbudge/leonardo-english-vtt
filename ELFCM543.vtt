Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English

00:00:08.582 --> 00:00:11.262
Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo

00:00:11.262 --> 00:00:13.512
English, the show where you can listen

00:00:13.512 --> 00:00:16.072
to fascinating stories and learn weird

00:00:16.092 --> 00:00:18.272
and wonderful things about the world at

00:00:18.272 --> 00:00:20.582
the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.132 --> 00:00:23.442
I'm Alastair Budge, and today,

00:00:23.482 --> 00:00:24.832
we are going to be talking

00:00:25.012 --> 00:00:27.132
about the history of perfume.

00:00:27.132 --> 00:00:29.992
It is a curious story that takes

00:00:29.992 --> 00:00:32.162
us from Ancient Mesopotamia to

00:00:32.162 --> 00:00:33.842
the Middle East, from southern

00:00:33.842 --> 00:00:36.432
France to modern airport terminals.

00:00:36.582 --> 00:00:38.442
So, I hope you’ll enjoy it.

00:00:38.862 --> 00:00:42.162
OK then, let’s get right into it and

00:00:42.162 --> 00:00:44.552
talk about the history of perfume.

00:00:45.642 --> 00:00:47.882
As any language learner knows,

00:00:48.342 --> 00:00:51.282
some words are best left in their

00:00:51.322 --> 00:00:53.956
original version, not translated.

00:00:55.094 --> 00:00:58.112
This is certainly true with French, a

00:00:58.112 --> 00:01:01.072
language people have long associated with

00:01:01.092 --> 00:01:04.182
beauty, sophistication, and elegance.

00:01:05.002 --> 00:01:08.252
And perhaps nowhere is it more true

00:01:08.592 --> 00:01:10.372
than when it comes to French words

00:01:10.412 --> 00:01:12.252
relating to something that France is

00:01:12.252 --> 00:01:15.332
rightfully very proud of: perfume.

00:01:16.682 --> 00:01:19.272
Take, for example, the small town

00:01:19.282 --> 00:01:21.012
in southern France that is the

00:01:21.062 --> 00:01:24.121
perfume capital of the world: Grasse.

00:01:24.545 --> 00:01:26.412
A name that evokes the fields

00:01:26.412 --> 00:01:28.642
of lavender and jasmine used in

00:01:28.642 --> 00:01:30.412
the world’s finest fragrances.

00:01:30.962 --> 00:01:33.432
But if you translate it into English?

00:01:33.912 --> 00:01:36.702
Well… Grasse just means “fat.”

00:01:37.572 --> 00:01:40.035
And what about the title given to

00:01:40.035 --> 00:01:42.725
the greatest perfumers—the masters of

00:01:42.725 --> 00:01:45.445
scent, the artists who create the most

00:01:45.485 --> 00:01:47.545
luxurious fragrances in the world?

00:01:48.405 --> 00:01:50.823
In French, they are called “grands

00:01:50.823 --> 00:01:53.565
nez”—which means “great nose.”

00:01:54.055 --> 00:01:56.285
Or, if you were being particularly

00:01:56.545 --> 00:01:58.415
uncharitable, you might

00:01:58.475 --> 00:02:00.635
translate it as… “big nose.”

00:02:02.035 --> 00:02:03.985
We’ll come to learn more about what it

00:02:04.035 --> 00:02:06.685
takes to become a “big nose”, or rather

00:02:06.855 --> 00:02:09.385
a “grand nez”, later on in the episode,

00:02:09.565 --> 00:02:12.585
but first, we must wind the clocks back

00:02:12.885 --> 00:02:15.325
and talk about the early days of perfume.

00:02:16.105 --> 00:02:19.615
And these early days were early indeed.

00:02:20.025 --> 00:02:22.078
The tradition of creating a scent

00:02:22.315 --> 00:02:24.275
and either covering your body in

00:02:24.275 --> 00:02:26.505
it or spraying it around a room

00:02:26.815 --> 00:02:28.975
goes back much further than modern

00:02:28.975 --> 00:02:31.655
France, further than Rome, and even

00:02:31.655 --> 00:02:33.865
further than the pyramids of Egypt.

00:02:34.552 --> 00:02:37.532
Some of the earliest evidence of creating

00:02:37.532 --> 00:02:41.502
scents dates back more than 4,000 years

00:02:41.672 --> 00:02:44.552
to Mesopotamia, in modern-day Iraq.

00:02:45.672 --> 00:02:47.752
And, from the very beginning,

00:02:48.172 --> 00:02:49.962
it had two purposes.

00:02:51.002 --> 00:02:54.162
The first was ritualistic; people

00:02:54.452 --> 00:02:57.242
burned aromatic resins, woods, and

00:02:57.242 --> 00:02:59.892
spices as offerings to their gods.

00:03:00.582 --> 00:03:03.302
The idea was simple: if something

00:03:03.362 --> 00:03:05.573
smelled heavenly, it was probably

00:03:05.593 --> 00:03:07.333
appreciated by the heavens.

00:03:08.383 --> 00:03:10.513
The other, well, it was for

00:03:10.513 --> 00:03:12.353
a far more practical reason.

00:03:13.413 --> 00:03:15.613
Today we live in a world where most

00:03:15.623 --> 00:03:17.433
people have showers in their houses,

00:03:17.793 --> 00:03:20.343
soap is cheap, deodorant is everywhere,

00:03:20.653 --> 00:03:22.873
and there really is no valid reason

00:03:23.103 --> 00:03:24.863
to not wash yourself regularly.

00:03:26.022 --> 00:03:27.913
But clearly, this is a

00:03:27.913 --> 00:03:30.243
relatively modern phenomenon.

00:03:30.963 --> 00:03:33.463
Go back a few centuries—or even

00:03:33.463 --> 00:03:35.575
just 100 years—and the world

00:03:35.713 --> 00:03:37.503
was a much smellier place.

00:03:38.153 --> 00:03:40.803
Without modern hygiene, strong body

00:03:40.803 --> 00:03:42.713
odours were just a part of life.

00:03:43.363 --> 00:03:46.473
Sweat, unwashed clothes, the lingering

00:03:46.473 --> 00:03:49.353
scent of livestock or open sewage in

00:03:49.353 --> 00:03:51.743
the streets, it was all unavoidable,

00:03:51.953 --> 00:03:54.193
the world was just smellier.

00:03:54.943 --> 00:03:57.433
And so, perfume wasn’t just about smelling

00:03:57.433 --> 00:04:00.963
nice, it was about covering up reality.

00:04:01.603 --> 00:04:05.093
So, how were these early perfumes created?

00:04:05.553 --> 00:04:08.173
Well, the process was not too

00:04:08.203 --> 00:04:11.113
dissimilar to modern perfume making.

00:04:11.643 --> 00:04:14.133
They would extract the fragrant

00:04:14.163 --> 00:04:16.473
oils from flowers, resins, and

00:04:16.473 --> 00:04:19.453
spices, and distil them to leave

00:04:19.473 --> 00:04:21.353
only the best-smelling scents.

00:04:22.623 --> 00:04:25.803
These scents were often used as religious

00:04:25.833 --> 00:04:28.873
offerings, both being burned in temples,

00:04:29.149 --> 00:04:31.813
and with priests dousing themselves

00:04:32.053 --> 00:04:34.563
with them during ceremonies, scents

00:04:34.563 --> 00:04:36.813
like frankincense and myrrh, which

00:04:36.813 --> 00:04:39.743
you might remember as being gifts the

00:04:39.783 --> 00:04:42.383
Three Kings brought to the baby Jesus.

00:04:43.123 --> 00:04:45.333
But perfume wasn’t just for the

00:04:45.333 --> 00:04:47.493
gods; it was also for the living,

00:04:47.943 --> 00:04:49.953
a way to have pleasant scents that

00:04:49.953 --> 00:04:51.903
followed you everywhere you went.

00:04:53.013 --> 00:04:56.073
And perhaps nowhere was this more

00:04:56.073 --> 00:04:58.783
true than in Ancient Egypt, where

00:04:58.823 --> 00:05:01.473
perfume became a serious status symbol.

00:05:02.563 --> 00:05:05.303
For the Egyptians, scent was as

00:05:05.303 --> 00:05:07.733
important as gold or fine clothing.

00:05:08.343 --> 00:05:11.453
The wealthy bathed in perfumed oils,

00:05:11.833 --> 00:05:14.573
covered their wigs in fragrant wax,

00:05:14.823 --> 00:05:17.213
and carried scented cones on their

00:05:17.223 --> 00:05:19.283
heads that would melt throughout the

00:05:19.283 --> 00:05:22.093
day, slowly releasing pleasant aromas.

00:05:23.443 --> 00:05:26.023
One theory about why perfume became

00:05:26.023 --> 00:05:28.513
particularly popular in Egypt is

00:05:28.513 --> 00:05:30.163
one that you might have guessed.

00:05:30.933 --> 00:05:32.473
Egypt is hot!

00:05:33.153 --> 00:05:36.163
A burning desert sun, long, sweaty

00:05:36.163 --> 00:05:38.753
days, and—like everywhere else

00:05:38.783 --> 00:05:41.233
in the ancient world—no soap, no

00:05:41.233 --> 00:05:43.613
deodorant, and no running water.

00:05:44.513 --> 00:05:47.028
Sure, as a wealthy and status-seeking

00:05:47.048 --> 00:05:49.688
Egyptian, you might have had people

00:05:49.835 --> 00:05:51.848
fanning you down and carrying you

00:05:51.848 --> 00:05:54.008
around in a chariot so you didn’t have

00:05:54.008 --> 00:05:56.878
to break a sweat, but if you wanted

00:05:56.878 --> 00:05:58.968
to avoid smelling too much like an

00:05:59.028 --> 00:06:02.358
overworked donkey, perfume was essential.

00:06:03.428 --> 00:06:06.238
And even the dead wore perfume.

00:06:07.218 --> 00:06:09.938
The mummification process involved

00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.992
covering bodies in frankincense,

00:06:12.258 --> 00:06:15.418
myrrh, and aromatic oils, not just

00:06:15.428 --> 00:06:18.298
for preservation, but so that the dead

00:06:18.428 --> 00:06:21.168
would smell divine in the afterlife.

00:06:22.328 --> 00:06:24.808
And then, of course, there was Cleopatra.

00:06:25.638 --> 00:06:27.208
She is said to have been

00:06:27.248 --> 00:06:28.928
obsessed with perfume.

00:06:29.838 --> 00:06:32.828
When she sailed to meet Mark Antony, so

00:06:32.848 --> 00:06:35.308
the legend goes, she had the sails of

00:06:35.308 --> 00:06:38.448
her boat soaked in perfume so that long

00:06:38.458 --> 00:06:41.048
before he saw her, he could smell her.

00:06:42.728 --> 00:06:46.188
It’s a dramatic story, perhaps not one

00:06:46.198 --> 00:06:49.078
based in any historical truth, but it

00:06:49.078 --> 00:06:52.061
is also a clever reminder of the power

00:06:52.091 --> 00:06:54.991
of scent: to create an impression,

00:06:55.041 --> 00:06:58.211
to seduce, and to linger in someone’s

00:06:58.211 --> 00:07:00.681
mind long after you’ve left the room.

00:07:01.761 --> 00:07:03.481
By the way, if you’d like to learn

00:07:03.481 --> 00:07:05.171
more about the fascinating life of

00:07:05.171 --> 00:07:09.121
Cleopatra, episode 461 is the one for you.

00:07:10.221 --> 00:07:13.321
But, if the Egyptians perfected

00:07:13.321 --> 00:07:15.881
the art of perfume, the Romans

00:07:16.061 --> 00:07:18.251
took its use to the extreme.

00:07:19.191 --> 00:07:22.111
Romans bathed in scented waters,

00:07:22.241 --> 00:07:24.761
and doused their clothes, furniture,

00:07:24.999 --> 00:07:27.252
and even their horses in fragrance.

00:07:28.312 --> 00:07:31.432
Some even had perfume fountains at

00:07:31.482 --> 00:07:33.982
their extravagant banquets, spraying

00:07:33.992 --> 00:07:36.032
scented mist over their guests.

00:07:36.972 --> 00:07:39.532
And, of course, perfume had a very

00:07:39.612 --> 00:07:41.962
practical function in Rome, because,

00:07:42.322 --> 00:07:44.522
once again, people smelled bad.

00:07:45.212 --> 00:07:47.592
Public baths helped, but let’s

00:07:47.592 --> 00:07:49.532
not forget that Roman cities

00:07:49.702 --> 00:07:52.712
had open sewers, unwashed togas,

00:07:52.712 --> 00:07:54.902
and streets filled with animals.

00:07:55.862 --> 00:07:58.332
If you were wealthy, you covered

00:07:58.332 --> 00:08:00.712
yourself in perfume to stand apart

00:08:00.962 --> 00:08:03.422
from the sweaty, unwashed masses.

00:08:04.492 --> 00:08:07.652
In fact, perfume became so popular in

00:08:07.652 --> 00:08:09.972
Rome that it started to be imported from

00:08:10.042 --> 00:08:13.402
all over the world: Arabian myrrh, Indian

00:08:13.402 --> 00:08:15.942
cinnamon, and North African flowers.

00:08:16.702 --> 00:08:19.702
It was a booming industry, and the

00:08:19.742 --> 00:08:21.922
average Roman senator’s daily perfume

00:08:21.922 --> 00:08:24.742
consumption would probably even put a

00:08:24.742 --> 00:08:27.492
member of the Kardashian family to shame.

00:08:28.512 --> 00:08:31.212
But with the fall of the Roman Empire,

00:08:31.685 --> 00:08:34.292
perfume’s prominence faded in much

00:08:34.292 --> 00:08:36.222
of Europe, at least for a while.

00:08:37.162 --> 00:08:39.222
While Europe “forgot” about

00:08:39.222 --> 00:08:41.443
perfume for several centuries, the

00:08:41.443 --> 00:08:43.763
Middle East became its new home.

00:08:44.663 --> 00:08:47.063
During the Islamic Golden Age, from

00:08:47.063 --> 00:08:50.073
the 8th to the 13th centuries, Arabic

00:08:50.103 --> 00:08:52.553
and Persian scientists revolutionised

00:08:52.583 --> 00:08:53.933
the way perfumes were made.

00:08:54.753 --> 00:08:57.773
They perfected distillation, which is a

00:08:57.773 --> 00:09:00.033
technique that allowed for the extraction

00:09:00.213 --> 00:09:04.243
of pure, concentrated scents, and is still

00:09:04.273 --> 00:09:06.773
a method used in modern perfume-making.

00:09:08.183 --> 00:09:10.803
And from here, from the Middle East,

00:09:11.153 --> 00:09:13.663
the knowledge of perfume spread back

00:09:13.863 --> 00:09:16.293
into Europe, carried along trade routes

00:09:16.313 --> 00:09:18.875
from the Middle East to Italy, Spain,

00:09:19.065 --> 00:09:20.855
and to the country that would become

00:09:20.855 --> 00:09:23.985
the spiritual home of perfume, France.

00:09:25.325 --> 00:09:27.475
If you were to ask someone today

00:09:27.755 --> 00:09:29.845
which country is most associated

00:09:29.845 --> 00:09:32.055
with perfume, the answer would

00:09:32.085 --> 00:09:34.015
almost certainly be France.

00:09:34.995 --> 00:09:37.815
And it is a well-deserved reputation.

00:09:38.565 --> 00:09:41.285
Because while the Romans indulged in

00:09:41.315 --> 00:09:44.275
excess, and the Middle East perfected

00:09:44.295 --> 00:09:46.343
the science, it was in France

00:09:46.533 --> 00:09:48.603
that perfume became an art form.

00:09:49.803 --> 00:09:51.603
But why France?

00:09:51.663 --> 00:09:54.363
And why Grasse, the small town you

00:09:54.363 --> 00:09:55.467
heard about at the start of the

00:09:55.467 --> 00:09:57.267
episode that still calls itself

00:09:57.267 --> 00:09:58.847
the perfume capital of the world?

00:10:00.047 --> 00:10:02.577
Well, strangely enough, it all

00:10:02.617 --> 00:10:05.107
comes down to leather gloves.

00:10:06.467 --> 00:10:09.247
In the 16th century, Grasse was

00:10:09.247 --> 00:10:11.677
famous for its glove-making industry.

00:10:12.277 --> 00:10:14.387
But there was one problem:

00:10:14.957 --> 00:10:16.577
they smelled terrible.

00:10:17.468 --> 00:10:20.767
This was real leather, made from the skin

00:10:20.787 --> 00:10:24.227
of dead cows, and as anyone who has ever

00:10:24.227 --> 00:10:27.287
spent any time at a tannery will know, the

00:10:27.287 --> 00:10:30.927
process of making leather smells very bad.

00:10:31.907 --> 00:10:35.897
So, local artisans began scenting the

00:10:35.897 --> 00:10:39.819
gloves with floral extracts to mask the

00:10:39.859 --> 00:10:43.139
unpleasant odour, to hide the nasty smell.

00:10:44.029 --> 00:10:46.862
This small innovation led

00:10:46.952 --> 00:10:48.892
to a huge transformation.

00:10:49.792 --> 00:10:52.822
The demand for scented products grew,

00:10:53.362 --> 00:10:55.612
and soon, combined with increased

00:10:55.622 --> 00:10:57.912
taxes on leather, Grasse’s leather

00:10:57.922 --> 00:11:00.552
industry faded away, replaced by

00:11:00.552 --> 00:11:04.112
something far more profitable: perfume.

00:11:05.942 --> 00:11:09.422
And by the time of King Louis XIV, in

00:11:09.432 --> 00:11:12.302
the late 17th and early 18th century,

00:11:12.752 --> 00:11:15.282
perfume was no longer just a luxury;

00:11:15.712 --> 00:11:18.482
it was a necessity at the royal court.

00:11:19.662 --> 00:11:22.622
The King of France was famously obsessed

00:11:22.642 --> 00:11:25.132
with fragrance, and the halls of

00:11:25.132 --> 00:11:27.782
his palace at Versailles were filled

00:11:27.782 --> 00:11:29.812
with the smells of perfumed waters,

00:11:30.102 --> 00:11:32.852
scented gloves, and aromatic balls.

00:11:34.037 --> 00:11:36.947
At a time when bathing was still rare,

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:39.600
perfume became a way of covering up

00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:42.610
unpleasant realities, not just for

00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:45.230
individuals, but for entire rooms.

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:47.650
Fountains in Versailles were

00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:49.690
filled with orange blossom water,

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:52.570
and royal furniture was sprayed

00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:54.845
with lavender and rose extracts.

00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:58.070
And it was during this time

00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:59.740
that the modern perfume

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:01.880
industry began to take shape.

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:05.980
Perfumers in Grasse and Paris began

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:08.130
refining their distillation techniques,

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:11.710
using alcohol instead of oil to create

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:14.590
lighter, more wearable fragrances.

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:17.860
These would be packaged up into

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.200
beautiful little bottles, not too

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.485
dissimilar to the stylised bottles

00:12:22.605 --> 00:12:24.095
that perfume comes in today.

00:12:24.935 --> 00:12:28.520
And by the 18th and 19th centuries,

00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:31.980
perfume was no longer just for royalty;

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:34.100
it was for anyone who could afford it.

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:37.450
Still, it was not cheap, but

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:39.170
it became something that was

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:41.420
available not just for a king.

00:12:42.396 --> 00:12:44.892
And this brings us to a big question:

00:12:45.312 --> 00:12:47.852
why is perfume still so expensive?

00:12:48.962 --> 00:12:51.992
Even if you don’t buy perfume yourself,

00:12:52.362 --> 00:12:54.352
you will probably have walked through the

00:12:54.362 --> 00:12:57.182
duty-free section of an airport or perhaps

00:12:57.182 --> 00:12:59.452
visited a high-end department store.

00:13:00.382 --> 00:13:01.472
And you’ll know that

00:13:01.472 --> 00:13:03.322
perfume doesn’t come cheap.

00:13:03.992 --> 00:13:06.332
A small bottle from a luxury brand

00:13:06.572 --> 00:13:09.452
can easily set you back €100 or more,

00:13:09.862 --> 00:13:12.332
and some even sell for thousands.

00:13:13.162 --> 00:13:15.337
But, if it’s just smelly

00:13:15.347 --> 00:13:17.777
water, why is it so expensive?

00:13:18.537 --> 00:13:20.857
Well, this isn’t a sponsored message

00:13:20.857 --> 00:13:23.557
from Chanel or the tourist authority of

00:13:23.557 --> 00:13:26.437
Grasse, but there are some good reasons.

00:13:27.507 --> 00:13:30.277
First, there’s the cost of ingredients.

00:13:31.067 --> 00:13:32.707
Some of the world’s most famous

00:13:32.737 --> 00:13:35.237
perfumes contain materials that are

00:13:35.267 --> 00:13:38.337
incredibly rare and difficult to obtain.

00:13:39.297 --> 00:13:42.577
Take, for example, oud, which is a resin

00:13:42.797 --> 00:13:44.977
produced by a particular type of tree

00:13:45.167 --> 00:13:47.267
when it becomes infected with mould.

00:13:47.797 --> 00:13:49.607
It’s one of the most expensive

00:13:49.797 --> 00:13:51.587
raw materials in the world,

00:13:51.907 --> 00:13:54.517
costing more per gram than gold.

00:13:55.557 --> 00:13:58.477
And even things that seem more

00:13:58.497 --> 00:14:00.527
run-of-the-mill, more ordinary,

00:14:00.797 --> 00:14:03.017
like jasmine and rose, which are

00:14:03.027 --> 00:14:04.957
used in many classic perfumes.

00:14:05.353 --> 00:14:07.978
It takes thousands of petals to

00:14:07.988 --> 00:14:10.678
produce just a few millilitres of

00:14:10.678 --> 00:14:13.701
essential oil, and harvesting them is

00:14:13.701 --> 00:14:16.221
a delicate, time-consuming process.

00:14:17.541 --> 00:14:19.381
And then there are the synthetic

00:14:19.401 --> 00:14:21.527
ingredients, which allow perfumers

00:14:21.761 --> 00:14:23.811
to create scents that don’t exist

00:14:23.811 --> 00:14:27.001
in nature, like the smell of fresh

00:14:27.041 --> 00:14:29.771
linen or a salty ocean breeze.

00:14:30.751 --> 00:14:32.981
These molecules can be incredibly

00:14:32.981 --> 00:14:36.191
expensive to develop, and some take

00:14:36.201 --> 00:14:38.431
years of research before they’re ready

00:14:38.431 --> 00:14:40.511
to be used in a commercial fragrance.

00:14:41.081 --> 00:14:43.811
So it’s not so dissimilar to some

00:14:43.881 --> 00:14:46.071
pharmaceutical drugs, where the raw

00:14:46.071 --> 00:14:49.171
materials might not be expensive, but

00:14:49.251 --> 00:14:51.001
all of the research and development

00:14:51.181 --> 00:14:53.351
that goes into creating them is,

00:14:53.761 --> 00:14:55.461
so that’s what you’re paying for.

00:14:56.631 --> 00:14:59.751
And, lest we forget, there’s the branding.

00:15:00.601 --> 00:15:02.351
When you buy a bottle of perfume,

00:15:02.711 --> 00:15:04.561
you’re not just paying for the liquid

00:15:04.561 --> 00:15:07.381
inside, you’re paying for the name, the

00:15:07.651 --> 00:15:10.843
bottle design, the advertising, and the

00:15:10.843 --> 00:15:13.183
luxury experience that comes with it.

00:15:14.123 --> 00:15:16.513
Perfume brands spend hundreds of

00:15:16.523 --> 00:15:19.083
millions on celebrity endorsements,

00:15:19.353 --> 00:15:21.353
high-profile marketing campaigns,

00:15:21.558 --> 00:15:23.691
and exclusive product launches.

00:15:24.315 --> 00:15:26.775
That little bottle on the shelf has been

00:15:26.775 --> 00:15:29.125
carefully positioned to make you feel

00:15:29.265 --> 00:15:31.215
like you’re not just buying a fragrance

00:15:31.305 --> 00:15:33.985
but a piece of a glamorous world.

00:15:35.385 --> 00:15:37.965
Of course, not all perfumes are expensive.

00:15:38.165 --> 00:15:39.985
There are plenty of more affordable

00:15:39.985 --> 00:15:42.675
options out there, but the reason some

00:15:42.685 --> 00:15:45.085
fragrances command such high prices

00:15:45.455 --> 00:15:47.865
is this combination of craftsmanship,

00:15:48.185 --> 00:15:50.245
rarity, and clever marketing.

00:15:51.705 --> 00:15:53.985
And behind every great perfume,

00:15:54.275 --> 00:15:56.666
there’s a person who created it.

00:15:57.342 --> 00:15:59.612
The term for someone who creates a perfume

00:15:59.932 --> 00:16:03.482
is a “nez”, a nose, and when you get to

00:16:03.482 --> 00:16:05.572
the top of your game, when you have the

00:16:05.582 --> 00:16:07.952
most highly-trained nose in the world,

00:16:08.462 --> 00:16:10.642
this is when you might be given the

00:16:10.652 --> 00:16:14.342
title of un “grand nez”, a great nose.

00:16:15.122 --> 00:16:17.862
Now, becoming a grand nez isn’t

00:16:17.862 --> 00:16:20.352
something that you or I can “apply

00:16:20.352 --> 00:16:22.512
for”, and it certainly isn’t

00:16:22.512 --> 00:16:24.252
something that happens overnight.

00:16:24.762 --> 00:16:27.932
It takes years of training, a truly

00:16:27.952 --> 00:16:31.142
exceptional sense of smell, and an ability

00:16:31.142 --> 00:16:33.812
to create complex, layered compositions.

00:16:34.852 --> 00:16:37.472
It isn’t an official title, and

00:16:37.732 --> 00:16:39.790
there is no official list of “grand

00:16:39.809 --> 00:16:42.342
nez”, but it’s thought that there are

00:16:42.362 --> 00:16:44.972
fewer than 100 worldwide, with some

00:16:44.972 --> 00:16:48.443
estimates putting it at as little as 30.

00:16:49.402 --> 00:16:52.552
In fact, saying “worldwide” is a little

00:16:52.552 --> 00:16:54.682
deceptive, as most of them are in

00:16:54.682 --> 00:16:58.052
France, split between Paris and Grasse.

00:16:58.953 --> 00:17:01.690
And something that might be surprising,

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:04.070
is that despite the fact that most

00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:06.700
perfume has historically been made

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:09.646
for women, the industry of being a

00:17:09.646 --> 00:17:11.976
“nez”, and especially the “grand nez”

00:17:12.308 --> 00:17:14.306
at the very top of the profession,

00:17:14.756 --> 00:17:16.936
has traditionally been a male one.

00:17:18.086 --> 00:17:21.286
Now, this is changing; women’s perfume

00:17:21.506 --> 00:17:24.906
has gone from being around 85% of

00:17:24.906 --> 00:17:28.156
the market to 60%, and there are

00:17:28.156 --> 00:17:30.016
more women getting involved in the

00:17:30.096 --> 00:17:33.036
business of making perfume, but it is

00:17:33.036 --> 00:17:35.746
a curiosity that it has traditionally

00:17:35.746 --> 00:17:38.686
been the noses of men that have decided

00:17:38.696 --> 00:17:41.066
what the noses of women would enjoy.

00:17:42.136 --> 00:17:45.362
Now, before we end this perfumed journey,

00:17:45.742 --> 00:17:47.832
I want to leave you with some interesting

00:17:47.832 --> 00:17:50.342
facts about the life of a “nez”.

00:17:51.582 --> 00:17:54.482
Firstly, although you might imagine one

00:17:54.482 --> 00:17:57.152
of these “grand nez” to always smell

00:17:57.162 --> 00:18:00.122
fantastic, and to be covered head to

00:18:00.122 --> 00:18:02.122
toe with fragrance when they come into

00:18:02.122 --> 00:18:04.238
the office in the morning, they aren’t.

00:18:05.398 --> 00:18:07.548
They have to avoid strong smells,

00:18:07.898 --> 00:18:10.038
precisely so that there is nothing

00:18:10.058 --> 00:18:12.838
interfering with their ability to detect

00:18:12.848 --> 00:18:15.438
the subtle nuances of different smells.

00:18:16.778 --> 00:18:19.388
Secondly, and on a related point

00:18:19.648 --> 00:18:21.868
and bucking the French stereotype,

00:18:22.258 --> 00:18:24.558
they must avoid garlic, as well

00:18:24.558 --> 00:18:26.798
as other spicy foods, because

00:18:26.888 --> 00:18:28.668
they too mean that you can’t

00:18:28.738 --> 00:18:30.928
differentiate as well between scents.

00:18:31.588 --> 00:18:33.978
And further defying certain French

00:18:33.978 --> 00:18:36.949
stereotypes, most grand nez also

00:18:36.989 --> 00:18:39.272
steer clear of coffee, cigarettes

00:18:39.272 --> 00:18:41.152
and alcohol for the same reasons.

00:18:42.412 --> 00:18:45.302
Thirdly, apparently, they do most of

00:18:45.302 --> 00:18:47.362
their hardest work in the morning.

00:18:48.281 --> 00:18:50.961
This isn’t some productivity hack,

00:18:51.371 --> 00:18:53.561
but rather that everyone’s sense of

00:18:53.561 --> 00:18:55.561
smell is most sensitive in the morning.

00:18:56.261 --> 00:18:58.841
And if your job relies on your sense of

00:18:58.841 --> 00:19:01.471
smell, well, I guess it does make sense to

00:19:01.471 --> 00:19:03.341
do the most important work in the morning.

00:19:04.661 --> 00:19:07.891
And while the job might seem glamorous,

00:19:08.021 --> 00:19:09.711
it’s also incredibly challenging.

00:19:10.361 --> 00:19:13.781
The competition is fierce, and trends

00:19:13.791 --> 00:19:16.271
in the perfume industry change rapidly.

00:19:16.861 --> 00:19:19.521
One year, everyone wants fresh,

00:19:19.821 --> 00:19:22.591
citrusy scents; the next, warm and

00:19:22.601 --> 00:19:24.271
woody fragrances are in demand.

00:19:24.921 --> 00:19:26.731
A perfumer has to be both an

00:19:26.791 --> 00:19:29.761
artist and a scientist, constantly

00:19:29.901 --> 00:19:32.871
experimenting, refining, and adapting.

00:19:33.811 --> 00:19:36.541
But if they succeed, their

00:19:36.541 --> 00:19:38.421
work can last for generations.

00:19:39.271 --> 00:19:41.091
Some of the most famous perfumes

00:19:41.091 --> 00:19:43.751
in history were created decades ago

00:19:44.251 --> 00:19:46.521
and are still bestsellers today.

00:19:47.561 --> 00:19:48.071
Chanel No.

00:19:48.071 --> 00:19:51.231
5, for example, has been around for over

00:19:51.231 --> 00:19:54.391
a hundred years and remains one of the

00:19:54.391 --> 00:19:56.771
most iconic fragrances in the world.

00:19:57.751 --> 00:20:00.671
So the next time you walk past a perfume

00:20:00.671 --> 00:20:03.051
counter and catch a familiar scent in

00:20:03.051 --> 00:20:05.801
the air, pause for a moment to think

00:20:05.811 --> 00:20:07.852
about the journey it took to get there.

00:20:08.651 --> 00:20:11.151
From the ancient temples of Mesopotamia

00:20:11.576 --> 00:20:13.351
to the laboratories of modern

00:20:13.351 --> 00:20:15.601
perfumers, from the rarest natural

00:20:15.601 --> 00:20:18.131
ingredients to the synthetic molecules

00:20:18.341 --> 00:20:20.901
designed to mimic them, perfume is

00:20:20.901 --> 00:20:22.911
much more than just a pleasant smell.

00:20:23.361 --> 00:20:26.121
It’s history, it’s science, it’s art.

00:20:26.743 --> 00:20:29.184
And above all, it’s something that

00:20:29.254 --> 00:20:31.834
connects us, across cultures, across

00:20:31.834 --> 00:20:34.724
time, through the power of scent.

00:20:35.774 --> 00:20:38.714
OK then, that is it for today's episode

00:20:38.964 --> 00:20:41.424
on the curious history of perfume.

00:20:41.814 --> 00:20:43.114

00:20:43.394 --> 00:20:44.954
