Hello, hello, hello, and welcome

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.810
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.640
Minds, by Leonardo English, the show

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.400
where you can listen to fascinating

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.909
stories and learn weird and wonderful

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.920
things about the world at the same

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.710
time as improving your English.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.370
I'm Alastair Budge, and today it’s the

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:27.470
start of our next three-part mini-series,

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.560
this time on the theme of “university”.

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:33.920
In part one, today’s episode, we’ll go on

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.499
a whirlwind journey through the history

00:00:36.509 --> 00:00:39.290
of universities and higher education, from

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.599
the Medieval period to the present day.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.370
In part two, we’ll zoom in and talk about

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.320
universities in the UK, the different

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.400
types of universities, what life is

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.480
like at a British university, and I’ll

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.980
share a load of my personal experience

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.389
too, as I spent a total of five years

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:01.660
studying at universities in the UK.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.289
And in part three, the final part, we’ll

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.859
talk about something that said it was

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.640
a university, but was later accused of

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.419
being a complete fraud: Trump University.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.200
OK then, let's not waste a

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.480
minute and get right into it.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.230
There are practically no institutions

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:25.920
that have survived for 1,000 years.

00:01:26.339 --> 00:01:29.240
The Vatican City only goes back just

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.059
over 700, the “ancient” city of Machu

00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:37.080
Picchu is not yet 600 years old, and even

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.430
sandwiches have only been around for 250.

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:44.140
Yet in just over 60 years’ time,

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.939
one institution will celebrate

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.539
its 1,000 year anniversary.

00:01:50.519 --> 00:01:54.159
The University of Bologna is, by some

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:56.920
measures, the world’s oldest university.

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.149
It was founded in the year

00:01:59.216 --> 00:02:04.939
1088, some 937 years ago.

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.860
If you go there today, the

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.849
university doesn’t seem very old,

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:12.899
or at least it doesn’t look so

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:14.950
different from the rest of the city.

00:02:15.843 --> 00:02:17.700
But of course, 1,000 years

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.129
ago, it was very different.

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:24.419
It bore little resemblance to any modern

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.050
university: no sprawling campus, no

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.420
central library, no stone quadrangles

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.810
where students wandered around in gowns.

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:38.089
In fact, the “university” was more

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:40.570
of an idea than a formal structure;

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:43.649
it was really an informal gathering

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.479
of young men who congregated in

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.469
the same place and hired older,

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.100
more learned men to instruct them.

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.419
Now, before we get into how this worked

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.009
in practice, and what they were studying,

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.159
we should address the question of “why?”.

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:05.289
Why then, and why there?

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:08.800
Why do we see universities springing up

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:12.739
in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries?

00:03:13.029 --> 00:03:15.320
Why in Europe in particular?

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.569
Well, a few things were happening at once.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.060
Europe in the 11th and 12th centuries was

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.910
finally becoming a little more stable.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:28.970
Populations were growing,

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.079
towns were expanding, and

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.380
trade was starting to flourish.

00:03:34.249 --> 00:03:36.349
In places like northern Italy,

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:39.269
new city-states were booming with

00:03:39.279 --> 00:03:42.280
merchants, bankers and notaries.

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.880
These were societies that needed

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.029
contracts, charters, and legal expertise.

00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:52.300
At the same time, something

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:53.570
extraordinary happened.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.499
Through contact with the Islamic

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.670
world, in Spain, Sicily, and during

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.170
the Crusades, European scholars

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.660
rediscovered long-lost works of ancient

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.490
philosophers, physicians, and thinkers.

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.060
In Bologna, a copy of Justinian’s

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.890
Corpus Juris Civilis, the great

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.280
code of Roman law, re-emerged.

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:21.209
This was alongside works of Aristotle,

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.150
the great Greek physician Galen, and more.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.270
Suddenly, there was a sophisticated body

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.119
of knowledge just waiting to be studied.

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:33.400
The Catholic Church

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.650
was also a huge factor.

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.440
It was the single most powerful

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.860
institution in Europe, owning vast

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.390
amounts of land, collecting taxes,

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.080
and even running its own courts.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.470
Historically, it had been where

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.820
knowledge and learning was confined to.

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.920
Monks were practically the only group

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.340
in society that could read and write;

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.250
books had to be meticulously copied by

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.630
hand, by monks, of course, and these

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.909
sources of knowledge were kept in

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:09.170
monasteries, often under lock and key.

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.380
But by this point, the

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.520
church’s needs had evolved.

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.950
To manage its sprawling empire it

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.169
needed more than just monks who

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:22.449
could pray and copy manuscripts.

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:25.819
It needed educated clergy: men

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.490
trained not only in theology but

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.490
also in law, philosophy, and the

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.200
practical business of administration.

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.049
So, on the one hand you had these

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.010
booming towns and ambitious rulers

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:43.589
who wanted lawyers and administrators.

00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:46.750
On the other, you had the Church demanding

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.610
skilled administrators and legal experts.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.950
And in the middle, you had

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:53.710
rediscovered texts of Roman

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.880
law and classical philosophy

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:57.849
providing the material to study.

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:02.189
It was a case of right time, right place.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.810
Now, importantly, these early

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:08.560
universities weren’t “founded” in

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.050
the sense we might think of today.

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:13.609
It wasn’t the Church or a king who

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:15.910
founded the University of Bologna.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.140
It was the students themselves.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.560
They banded together in

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:23.600
guilds, pooled their money, and

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:25.680
hired masters to teach them.

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:29.200
This is what “universitas” originally

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.280
meant, not “a university” as we think

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.639
of today, but a corporation of students.

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:40.789
And what gave these communities staying

00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:44.109
power, the ability to continue year after

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:47.300
year, was recognition from the pope.

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:50.760
Popes issued charters granting

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.710
universities privileges, such as exemption

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:56.350
from local taxes, the right to be tried

00:06:56.359 --> 00:06:59.010
in church courts, and most importantly,

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:01.550
the authority for their degrees to

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:03.500
be recognised across Christendom.

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:06.460
In other words, someone could take their

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:09.330
degree from the University of Bologna

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.409
and show it to their master in Paris,

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:14.479
and it would be recognised as valid.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.770
Now, in terms of what students would

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:21.600
study at these universities, the

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:24.690
curriculum was surprisingly uniform.

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:28.100
A young man, and they were almost

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.509
always men, would typically begin

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:32.716
with what was known as the trivium:

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:35.800
grammar, rhetoric, and logic.

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:38.680
In practical terms, this meant

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.220
first mastering Latin, which

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.749
was the language of the church.

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:46.000
Then, mastering how to craft an

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:48.209
argument and deliver a speech.

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:50.689
And then it was logic: the art

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:53.090
of reason, evaluating statements

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:55.570
logically and systematically.

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:59.799
It wasn’t so different from some

00:07:59.799 --> 00:08:01.250
of the skills that you might

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:02.430
have learned at university.

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:05.749
And once the young man had

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:08.000
mastered those, he would move on

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.580
to the quadrivium: arithmetic,

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:13.700
geometry, music, and astronomy.

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:18.349
Together, these seven subjects made up the

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:21.149
so-called “liberal arts,” which were the

00:08:21.159 --> 00:08:24.519
foundation of medieval higher education.

00:08:25.279 --> 00:08:28.069
After this, the most ambitious and wealthy

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:30.250
students could progress to the higher

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:33.730
faculties of law, medicine, and theology.

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:36.710
And, not unlike the modern

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:38.729
day, different universities

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:40.799
excelled at different subjects.

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:44.250
Law was especially important at Bologna,

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:48.390
theology dominated in Paris, and medicine

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.330
was strong in places like Salerno.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.640
Degrees could take years, even decades,

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:57.530
to complete, and many students never

00:08:57.530 --> 00:09:00.310
finished, again, not so dissimilar

00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:02.259
to some modern universities.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:06.980
And by the 13th and 14th centuries,

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:08.740
universities had appeared in

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.360
Oxford, Cambridge, Salamanca,

00:09:11.413 --> 00:09:13.833
Padua, Prague, and Heidelberg.

00:09:14.666 --> 00:09:16.990
Wherever they were founded, they became

00:09:16.999 --> 00:09:20.629
magnets for ambitious men and symbols

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:22.830
of prestige for the rulers who would

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:25.120
often sponsor them, paying for their

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:27.440
fees and living expenses, with the

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.760
expectation that they would return

00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:32.369
and serve them after they graduated.

00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:35.890
A little like an employer today paying

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:37.810
for someone to go and do an MBA.

00:09:38.699 --> 00:09:41.340
After all, for these young men, there was

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:44.390
a clear incentive to go to university.

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:47.889
Mastering Roman and canon law wasn’t

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:51.020
just an intellectual exercise; it was a

00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:54.839
ticket to a career as a notary, a judge,

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:57.990
or an adviser to a bishop or prince.

00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:01.709
In a society where almost all power

00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:05.159
was mediated through law or the Church,

00:10:05.829 --> 00:10:08.939
education became a pathway to influence,

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:11.250
and one that was worth paying for.

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:15.560
Now, although by the 14th century or

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:18.520
so, universities were well-established,

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:21.830
and there were around 50 scattered

00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:24.060
across Europe, they still only

00:10:24.089 --> 00:10:27.119
educated an extreme minority of

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.819
the population, so we’re probably

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:32.690
talking about fewer than 50,000

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:35.840
students at every university in total.

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:40.429
And most graduates would become clergyman,

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:44.089
priests, or some form of administrator

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:47.039
within the church or a city state system.

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:51.159
But as Europe moved into the Renaissance,

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:53.450
universities began to change.

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:56.630
Instead of focusing almost entirely

00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:59.840
on theology and law, a new movement

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:01.989
of scholars known as humanists

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:05.260
championed the studia humanitatis:

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.619
the study of grammar, rhetoric,

00:11:07.779 --> 00:11:10.800
history, poetry, and moral philosophy.

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:14.440
These were subjects drawn from the

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.690
classical world, inspired by the

00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:19.440
rediscovery of Greek and Roman texts.

00:11:20.089 --> 00:11:23.010
They shifted the focus away from purely

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:26.599
preparing men for service in the church or

00:11:26.599 --> 00:11:29.690
the courtroom, and towards shaping a more

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:33.170
rounded, critical, and eloquent citizen.

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:36.509
Then came the Scientific Revolution,

00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:39.290
and with it, the university became a

00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:42.670
place not only for preserving existing

00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:44.990
knowledge but also for producing it.

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:47.740
Now, this is an important

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.250
distinction to make.

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:53.050
For the first four to five centuries,

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:55.240
universities were places for

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:57.949
students to learn from the current

00:11:58.260 --> 00:11:59.790
corpus of knowledge; there was

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:02.889
no focus whatsoever on discovery,

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:05.710
of challenging accepted knowledge

00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:08.199
and research to uncover new ideas.

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:10.949
Science, of course, is all about

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:13.600
pushing human understanding forward,

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:17.510
questioning why the world is how it is.

00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:20.520
If you were Galileo Galilei at

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:22.350
the University of Padua, in Italy,

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:25.020
this meant asking yourself whether

00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:27.370
the sun goes around the Earth or

00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:28.950
the Earth goes around the sun.

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:32.170
If you were Sir Isaac Newton in Cambridge,

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:34.959
in England, this meant asking what

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:37.630
causes an apple to fall from the sky.

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:41.240
It might sound obvious, especially

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:43.020
now when a large chunk of a

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:44.960
university lecturer’s time is

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.770
supposed to be dedicated to

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:49.870
research, but at the time, it wasn’t.

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:53.720
And by the 18th and 19th centuries,

00:12:54.039 --> 00:12:56.050
universities were being reshaped

00:12:56.109 --> 00:12:58.570
again, pushing them even further

00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:00.209
towards what we see today.

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:04.180
In Berlin, Wilhelm von Humboldt developed

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:07.290
a new model: the idea that research

00:13:07.419 --> 00:13:10.160
and teaching should go hand in hand,

00:13:10.709 --> 00:13:13.289
that scholars should be free to pursue

00:13:13.289 --> 00:13:15.520
knowledge wherever it might lead.

00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:19.990
This so-called “Humboldtian” model spread

00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:22.890
quickly and influenced universities across

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:24.990
Europe, and later the United States.

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:28.040
It is, of course, the basis for

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:30.250
much of modern higher education.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.740
Universities should educate young,

00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:36.620
curious minds, but they should also

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:39.380
be centres of research and discovery.

00:13:40.299 --> 00:13:43.429
So, by this point, at the turn of the

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:45.680
20th century, there were something like

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:49.030
200 universities worldwide, depending on

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:52.050
exactly what you classify as a university.

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:55.710
The student body had also expanded,

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:58.090
but there were still only around

00:13:58.090 --> 00:14:00.419
500,000 university students

00:14:00.490 --> 00:14:03.600
worldwide, a tiny fraction of the

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:07.220
estimated 250 million students today.

00:14:08.019 --> 00:14:10.850
University was still exclusive,

00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:13.860
expensive, and an option only

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:16.720
for a tiny sliver of society.

00:14:17.709 --> 00:14:20.259
This all started to change in the

00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:23.019
post-war period, when governments

00:14:23.049 --> 00:14:25.469
across the developed world invested

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:27.400
heavily in higher education.

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:30.700
In the United States, the GI

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:32.940
Bill gave returning soldiers

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:34.550
the chance to go to college.

00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:36.890
In Europe, new universities

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:38.380
opened their doors for a

00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:40.810
generation hungry for opportunity.

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:44.159
And across Asia, Africa, and

00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:46.110
Latin America, universities

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:48.209
were established as symbols of

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:51.650
independence, progress, and modernity.

00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:54.959
For the first time in history,

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:57.530
higher education was no longer

00:14:57.570 --> 00:14:59.680
the preserve of a tiny elite.

00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:03.280
And that brings us to the modern day.

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:06.580
There is no single accepted figure

00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:08.480
for the number of universities

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:11.220
worldwide, with estimates ranging

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:15.290
from 25,000 to 50,000, educating

00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:18.540
an estimated 250 million students.

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:21.760
It is, for many professions,

00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:24.089
still an almost mandatory

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:26.560
requirement, making university a

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:29.270
necessary next step after school.

00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:33.790
In the UK, like most countries, getting a

00:15:33.839 --> 00:15:37.600
“good” job is significantly harder without

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:40.540
a university degree, and the better the

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:42.980
university you went to, and the better

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:45.470
grades you got, the more likely you are

00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:47.450
to find a good job after graduation.

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.500
There are plenty of counter-examples

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:53.189
to this, of self-made millionaires

00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:55.139
who dropped out of school and carved

00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:58.570
their own path to success, but these

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:01.270
are anomalies, in the UK at least.

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:04.130
If you look through the CV or

00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:06.880
Wikipedia page of almost anyone who

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:09.980
has achieved “career success” in some

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:12.380
form of professional environment, you

00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:14.890
will almost certainly find the name

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:16.850
of a reputable university on there.

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:20.820
And in the UK, successive British

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:23.170
governments have pushed to get as

00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:25.000
many young people into university

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.090
as possible, proclaiming that the

00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:28.739
percentage of people graduating

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:31.579
from university is a success metric.

00:16:31.976 --> 00:16:34.680
High = good, low = bad.

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:39.520
In 1997, Tony Blair famously stated

00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:42.260
that he wanted 50% of British

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.310
young people to go to university.

00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:47.430
At the time, it was seen as

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:49.910
ambitious, almost utopian

00:16:50.839 --> 00:16:52.670
It took 20 years, but

00:16:53.121 --> 00:16:55.680
in 2017, it happened.

00:16:56.359 --> 00:16:58.750
50.2% of young people in the

00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:01.050
UK went on to higher education.

00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:04.760
And in fact, if you removed men from the

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:07.060
equation, the target would have been hit

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:11.520
much faster, as only 44% of men go on to

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:15.100
higher education while 57% of women do.

00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:20.759
Now, 50% is significant, and moving above

00:17:20.839 --> 00:17:24.279
50% means it’s something most people do.

00:17:25.039 --> 00:17:26.669
And if it is something that

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:29.400
most people do, it has, by

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:31.890
definition, become less valuable.

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:35.290
And students are no longer studying

00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:38.029
the trivium: grammar, rhetoric, and

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:39.990
logic, or at least, most aren’t.

00:17:40.839 --> 00:17:43.419
There has been a boom in vocational

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:46.200
courses, courses that teach students

00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:49.460
practical skills and prepare them for

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:53.050
a particular job or career: hospitality

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:55.590
management, journalism, and so on.

00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:59.160
And the criticism of many of these

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:02.930
courses is that, perhaps ironically, they

00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:05.270
don’t do a very good job at preparing

00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:07.260
students for the professional world.

00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:10.859
A degree in “golf management” might

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:13.940
sound perfect for a 17-year-old fan of

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:17.520
golf, but the reality is that it probably

00:18:17.549 --> 00:18:19.940
isn’t even the best course to study if

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:21.910
they want to work in the golf industry.

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:24.520
And alongside this, we

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:25.850
must mention the cost.

00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:28.310
As you might remember from episode

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:31.939
number 513, on the UK university

00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:34.949
crisis, the cost of university has

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:37.670
expanded dramatically in the UK.

00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:42.853
Before 1997, it was free, and it has

00:18:42.853 --> 00:18:46.700
risen to almost €10,000 per year today.

00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:50.899
It is expensive, and that’s before you

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:53.539
factor in the cost of living as a student.

00:18:54.619 --> 00:18:57.130
Indeed, according to a report that

00:18:57.130 --> 00:18:59.639
came out this summer, the average

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:02.320
student in the UK graduates with

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:07.089
£53,000 in debt, around €60,000.

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:09.950
Interestingly enough, this is actually

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:13.020
more than the average student in the US.

00:19:13.519 --> 00:19:15.520
The difference is that the cost of

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:19.100
tuition in the US varies wildly, so

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:21.770
the most expensive degrees at the most

00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:24.010
prestigious American universities can

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:27.669
cost over $100,000 a year, while some

00:19:27.669 --> 00:19:29.450
universities can be completely free.

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:33.379
In the UK, the best university can cost

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:36.480
the same as the worst university, which

00:19:36.490 --> 00:19:38.620
leads to the situation that everyone

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:42.170
has relatively equal high costs, but

00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:44.559
of course, not everyone graduates with

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:46.940
degrees of equal value, which is something

00:19:47.049 --> 00:19:48.970
we’ll talk more about in the next episode.

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:53.370
Now, to wrap up this exploration of

00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:56.080
higher education through time, I want

00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:57.960
to leave you with one last thought,

00:19:58.410 --> 00:20:01.080
and that’s about things that have and

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:03.889
haven’t changed over the almost 1,000

00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:06.580
years of the existence of university.

00:20:07.593 --> 00:20:09.700
One theme is the university

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:11.520
student’s perpetual feeling

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:12.930
of not having enough money.

00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:15.659
It’s understandable; students are,

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:18.590
theoretically speaking, too busy studying

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:21.559
to work, and with often hefty tuition

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:24.640
fees to pay and rent to make, history

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:26.860
is filled with examples of students

00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:29.410
complaining about being short on cash.

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:31.890
Something that might have changed,

00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:34.450
however, is students' priorities

00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:36.560
about what they spend their money on.

00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:39.900
So I’ll leave you with a quote from one

00:20:39.996 --> 00:20:42.970
15th-century Dutch student, Desiderius

00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:46.090
Erasmus Roterodamus, or Erasmus of

00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:48.470
Rotterdam, as he is most commonly known.

00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:52.230
He famously said, “When I have a little

00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:55.380
money, I buy books; and if I have

00:20:55.410 --> 00:20:58.110
any left, I buy food and clothes.”

00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:00.970
If Erasmus were a student

00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:03.080
today, I wonder whether he would

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:05.180
still have the same priorities…

00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:08.710
OK, then, that is it for today's

00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:11.159
episode on the history of universities.

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:12.750
I hope it's been an interesting one

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:14.270
and that you've learnt something

00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:16.139
new, at least something you might

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:17.789
not have learned at university.

00:21:18.459 --> 00:21:20.119
As a reminder, this is part

00:21:20.129 --> 00:21:22.380
one of a three-part mini-series

00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:24.150
on the theme of “university”.

00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:27.040
Next up, in part two, we’ll be talking

00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:29.179
about universities in Britain: the

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:30.969
different types of universities, the

00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:33.260
application process, university culture,

00:21:33.539 --> 00:21:35.649
and what life is like if you choose

00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:37.260
to study at a British university.

00:21:37.879 --> 00:21:39.870
And in part three, we’ll also be

00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:41.730
talking about something that called

00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:43.939
itself a university, but got into a

00:21:43.939 --> 00:21:46.290
lot of trouble for doing so: Trump

00:21:46.299 --> 00:21:49.020
University, and the scandal that followed.

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:51.470
You've been listening to English Learning

00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:54.160
for Curious Minds by Leonardo English.

00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:57.490
I'm Alastair Budge, you stay safe, and

00:21:57.490 --> 00:21:59.710
I'll catch you in the next episode.
