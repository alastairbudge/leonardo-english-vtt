Hello, hello, hello, and welcome

00:00:08.006 --> 00:00:09.976
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.976 --> 00:00:12.806
Minds, by Leonardo English, the show

00:00:12.816 --> 00:00:14.466
where you can listen to fascinating

00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:16.856
stories and learn weird and wonderful

00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:18.776
things about the world at the same

00:00:18.776 --> 00:00:20.546
time as improving your English.

00:00:20.906 --> 00:00:23.356
I'm Alastair Budge, and today it’s

00:00:23.376 --> 00:00:26.606
part two of our three-part mini-series

00:00:26.826 --> 00:00:29.236
on “Tyrants Of The Roman Empire”.

00:00:29.796 --> 00:00:31.616
In case you missed it, in part

00:00:31.616 --> 00:00:33.646
one we talked about Caligula.

00:00:34.016 --> 00:00:35.746
Next time, in part three,

00:00:35.916 --> 00:00:37.596
we’ll talk about Commodus.

00:00:37.926 --> 00:00:41.196
And today it’s Nero, a man who

00:00:41.196 --> 00:00:43.476
has been called the antichrist,

00:00:43.486 --> 00:00:46.076
remembered by history for brutality,

00:00:46.346 --> 00:00:49.656
depravity and almost unmatched sadism.

00:00:50.036 --> 00:00:52.286
You don’t have to have listened to part

00:00:52.286 --> 00:00:55.356
one, on Caligula, to enjoy this one, but

00:00:55.556 --> 00:00:58.326
it will make more sense if you have, and

00:00:58.356 --> 00:01:00.486
rather than go over stuff again, I’ll

00:01:00.486 --> 00:01:02.266
assume that you’ve listened to part one.

00:01:02.656 --> 00:01:05.056
So now is the time to press pause

00:01:05.276 --> 00:01:06.816
and go and listen to that one, in

00:01:06.816 --> 00:01:08.456
case you haven’t done so already.

00:01:08.976 --> 00:01:11.026
Alright then, let’s not waste a minute,

00:01:11.366 --> 00:01:13.076
especially as this is going to be quite a

00:01:13.086 --> 00:01:16.363
long one, and find out about Emperor Nero.

00:01:17.466 --> 00:01:20.346
As you may know, there is the stereotype

00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:24.406
of the Italian “mother’s boy”, a boy, a

00:01:24.406 --> 00:01:27.536
man even, who has a particularly close

00:01:27.576 --> 00:01:30.676
bond with his mother, perhaps even living

00:01:30.676 --> 00:01:33.686
with her until well into his adult years.

00:01:34.666 --> 00:01:37.166
There’s a word for this, “mammone”,

00:01:37.686 --> 00:01:40.026
and, like many stereotypes,

00:01:40.416 --> 00:01:42.736
it has some basis in fact.

00:01:43.836 --> 00:01:46.126
I did an ERASMUS exchange at the

00:01:46.126 --> 00:01:48.706
University of Naples, and can certainly

00:01:48.706 --> 00:01:51.526
say that my male Italian friends would be

00:01:51.526 --> 00:01:54.176
constantly calling their mothers, updating

00:01:54.176 --> 00:01:55.906
them on where they were going that

00:01:55.946 --> 00:01:58.276
evening or what they had had for lunch.

00:01:58.946 --> 00:02:02.036
Occasionally, the intensity of this

00:02:02.096 --> 00:02:04.766
mother-son relationship did drive

00:02:04.796 --> 00:02:07.106
something of a wedge between these

00:02:07.106 --> 00:02:09.196
young men and their girlfriends.

00:02:09.966 --> 00:02:12.106
And even going back to Ancient

00:02:12.126 --> 00:02:14.216
Rome, we can see that this

00:02:14.216 --> 00:02:16.416
is not a modern phenomenon.

00:02:17.576 --> 00:02:20.536
In AD 58, a young man was

00:02:20.616 --> 00:02:23.146
taunted by his new lover over

00:02:23.146 --> 00:02:25.026
his relationship with his mother.

00:02:25.966 --> 00:02:28.226
The man invited his mother to a

00:02:28.226 --> 00:02:30.876
feast at Baiae, an ancient Roman

00:02:30.876 --> 00:02:33.446
town just across the bay of Naples.

00:02:34.106 --> 00:02:36.831
The mother came to the feast, and on her

00:02:36.831 --> 00:02:41.126
return her son offered her his boat, as

00:02:41.126 --> 00:02:43.636
hers had been damaged on the journey over.

00:02:45.046 --> 00:02:47.416
This wasn’t a kindly gesture,

00:02:47.806 --> 00:02:49.006
and the mother knew it.

00:02:50.396 --> 00:02:53.696
The son, the then 21-year-old

00:02:53.926 --> 00:02:56.746
Emperor Nero, had ordered for a

00:02:56.786 --> 00:02:59.566
specially modified boat to be built

00:02:59.916 --> 00:03:02.456
that would sink at a predetermined

00:03:02.456 --> 00:03:05.556
time, killing everyone onboard.

00:03:06.696 --> 00:03:09.026
His mother, Aggripina the Younger,

00:03:09.386 --> 00:03:12.256
had got wind of the plan, but she had

00:03:12.256 --> 00:03:14.506
little choice but to go ahead with it.

00:03:15.586 --> 00:03:18.103
She boarded the ship, knowing her

00:03:18.136 --> 00:03:20.836
only son was sending her to her death.

00:03:22.076 --> 00:03:24.696
Sure enough, as the ship sailed across

00:03:24.696 --> 00:03:27.686
the bay, it started to disintegrate.

00:03:28.456 --> 00:03:31.266
Pieces of wood broke off, and

00:03:31.276 --> 00:03:33.286
the vessel started to sink.

00:03:34.606 --> 00:03:37.896
What Nero hadn’t bargained for was

00:03:37.896 --> 00:03:40.396
that his mother was a strong swimmer.

00:03:41.496 --> 00:03:44.696
She managed to swim to shore, and she was

00:03:44.696 --> 00:03:48.266
met by cheers and well-wishers, rejoicing

00:03:48.266 --> 00:03:50.436
with relief that the emperor’s mother

00:03:50.616 --> 00:03:52.906
had survived this "tragic accident".

00:03:54.436 --> 00:03:56.846
This relief wouldn’t last for long.

00:03:57.846 --> 00:04:00.616
When Nero got wind that his plot

00:04:00.626 --> 00:04:02.736
had failed, he hatched another.

00:04:03.896 --> 00:04:06.346
He sent armed men to his mother’s

00:04:06.346 --> 00:04:08.436
villa, instructing them to

00:04:08.476 --> 00:04:10.966
dispatch her, once and for all.

00:04:12.036 --> 00:04:15.066
They surrounded her bed, and when she

00:04:15.066 --> 00:04:17.636
realised that her fate was inevitable,

00:04:18.026 --> 00:04:20.956
she pointed at her womb, her belly,

00:04:21.346 --> 00:04:24.356
telling the men to “strike here, because

00:04:24.366 --> 00:04:26.636
that is where the monster came from”.

00:04:27.746 --> 00:04:30.736
It is an impressive story, and has

00:04:30.756 --> 00:04:32.946
gone down in the history books as

00:04:32.946 --> 00:04:35.356
just one example of the callous

00:04:35.506 --> 00:04:39.196
brutality of Nero, a man whose very

00:04:39.196 --> 00:04:42.236
name has become a byword for cruelty.

00:04:43.526 --> 00:04:46.206
It is also, perhaps, not true.

00:04:47.436 --> 00:04:50.276
Several modern historians have tried

00:04:50.306 --> 00:04:53.276
to revisit the myth and reputation of

00:04:53.276 --> 00:04:55.956
Nero, with some concluding that he was

00:04:55.976 --> 00:04:59.016
probably not quite as bad as most people

00:04:59.026 --> 00:05:02.076
think, and others simply pointing out

00:05:02.386 --> 00:05:04.656
that the accounts we have of his life

00:05:04.806 --> 00:05:07.506
and his actions, like those of Caligula

00:05:07.956 --> 00:05:10.786
are highly biased, so we should not

00:05:10.796 --> 00:05:13.516
blindly accept everything that is written

00:05:13.526 --> 00:05:16.156
about him as true, but rather as the

00:05:16.156 --> 00:05:19.166
historical record of men with an agenda.

00:05:20.636 --> 00:05:24.086
Now, to understand Nero, like we did last

00:05:24.086 --> 00:05:27.096
episode, we must start before his birth.

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.986
Caligula, as you’ll remember

00:05:30.026 --> 00:05:32.176
from last time, had no

00:05:32.206 --> 00:05:34.076
surviving children of his own.

00:05:35.216 --> 00:05:37.276
When he was stabbed to death in

00:05:37.276 --> 00:05:40.306
that theatre corridor in AD 41,

00:05:40.856 --> 00:05:43.356
the title of emperor passed to his

00:05:43.416 --> 00:05:46.496
uncle Claudius, a man whom almost

00:05:46.506 --> 00:05:48.560
nobody expected to become emperor.

00:05:49.463 --> 00:05:51.476
Claudius had been hidden

00:05:51.476 --> 00:05:52.826
away for much of his life.

00:05:53.256 --> 00:05:56.246
He walked with a limp, spoke with

00:05:56.246 --> 00:05:58.786
a stammer, and had been dismissed

00:05:58.996 --> 00:06:01.506
as weak-minded by his own family.

00:06:02.336 --> 00:06:05.466
Yet the Praetorian Guard, who were keen

00:06:05.466 --> 00:06:08.286
to have someone malleable on the throne,

00:06:08.656 --> 00:06:11.026
found him cowering behind a curtain in

00:06:11.026 --> 00:06:13.583
the palace and declared him emperor.

00:06:14.266 --> 00:06:17.296
And Claudius actually turned out to be a

00:06:17.296 --> 00:06:20.316
more competent emperor than many expected.

00:06:20.986 --> 00:06:23.546
He expanded the empire into Britain,

00:06:23.856 --> 00:06:25.856
reformed aspects of the legal

00:06:25.856 --> 00:06:28.726
system, and generally kept the

00:06:28.726 --> 00:06:31.016
machine of empire ticking over.

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:34.686
But for today’s episode, and the story

00:06:34.686 --> 00:06:38.046
of Nero, Claudius matters not so much

00:06:38.056 --> 00:06:41.016
for his conquests as for his marriages.

00:06:41.576 --> 00:06:43.696
In particular, his final one.

00:06:44.566 --> 00:06:46.546
And it’s here that we need to

00:06:46.546 --> 00:06:49.126
re-introduce Agrippina the Younger.

00:06:49.876 --> 00:06:52.446
She was the sister of Caligula, and

00:06:52.616 --> 00:06:54.636
was also the great-granddaughter

00:06:54.976 --> 00:06:57.006
of the first emperor, Augustus.

00:06:57.806 --> 00:06:59.336
She was the Roman equivalent

00:06:59.633 --> 00:07:02.376
of royalty, and she married a

00:07:02.396 --> 00:07:04.406
high-ranking Roman politican.

00:07:05.186 --> 00:07:07.226
They had one biological child,

00:07:07.526 --> 00:07:10.776
Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, but

00:07:11.156 --> 00:07:13.186
his chances at becoming emperor

00:07:13.496 --> 00:07:16.426
looked slim at best, as he wasn’t

00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:18.216
directly in the line of succession.

00:07:19.156 --> 00:07:20.986
What’s more, a couple of years

00:07:21.026 --> 00:07:23.776
into his reign as emperor, Caligula

00:07:23.776 --> 00:07:25.406
had discovered that his sister

00:07:25.586 --> 00:07:27.516
was plotting to have him killed.

00:07:28.366 --> 00:07:30.766
He sent her into exile on a

00:07:30.766 --> 00:07:32.426
remote Mediterannean island.

00:07:32.856 --> 00:07:34.196
And a couple of years

00:07:34.196 --> 00:07:36.196
later, her husband died.

00:07:37.516 --> 00:07:39.716
When Caligula was deposed and

00:07:39.776 --> 00:07:42.046
Claudius made emperor, the new

00:07:42.046 --> 00:07:44.926
emperor recalled Agrippina from exile.

00:07:45.506 --> 00:07:48.406
She re-emerged in public life,

00:07:48.436 --> 00:07:50.706
back in Rome, but she was a

00:07:50.716 --> 00:07:53.276
widow with no connections.

00:07:54.106 --> 00:07:56.386
She was, however, ruthlessly

00:07:56.426 --> 00:07:58.906
ambitious, and incredibly capable.

00:08:00.386 --> 00:08:03.426
To cut a long story short, through a

00:08:03.436 --> 00:08:06.136
series of marriages, alliances, and

00:08:06.136 --> 00:08:07.976
deaths that some have claimed were

00:08:07.986 --> 00:08:11.346
murder, Agrippina ended up married

00:08:11.396 --> 00:08:13.956
to her uncle, emperor Claudius.

00:08:15.146 --> 00:08:18.426
Claudius had another son from his

00:08:18.516 --> 00:08:20.760
previous marriage, Britannicus,

00:08:20.986 --> 00:08:23.586
but the boy was a few years younger

00:08:23.756 --> 00:08:25.876
than Agrippina’s son, Lucius.

00:08:26.696 --> 00:08:29.646
Agrippina managed to persuade Claudius

00:08:29.856 --> 00:08:33.166
to officially adopt Lucius, making the

00:08:33.166 --> 00:08:36.056
two boys the ageing Claudius’s heirs.

00:08:37.176 --> 00:08:40.456
And to cement his position, she arranged

00:08:40.466 --> 00:08:43.096
for Lucius, at the age of sixteen,

00:08:43.486 --> 00:08:46.146
to marry Claudius’ daughter, Octavia.

00:08:47.363 --> 00:08:50.143
It was an extraordinary piece of dynastic

00:08:50.143 --> 00:08:53.163
chess, 10 out of 10 political manoeuvring.

00:08:54.193 --> 00:08:57.563
In less than ten years, Agrippina had

00:08:57.563 --> 00:09:00.443
gone from outcast to the very centre

00:09:00.653 --> 00:09:03.403
of Roman power, and had placed her

00:09:03.443 --> 00:09:06.113
son in the best possible position.

00:09:07.273 --> 00:09:09.593
This son, Lucius, would

00:09:09.593 --> 00:09:11.600
later be known as Nero.

00:09:12.833 --> 00:09:16.143
And then, in AD 54, after one of

00:09:16.143 --> 00:09:18.813
his famous banquets, Claudius died.

00:09:19.553 --> 00:09:21.993
Poisoned mushrooms, according to one

00:09:21.993 --> 00:09:25.003
story, although whether Agrippina had

00:09:25.003 --> 00:09:27.383
a hand in that, or they were simply

00:09:27.393 --> 00:09:29.543
bad mushrooms, we can’t be sure.

00:09:30.493 --> 00:09:32.123
What we do know is that the

00:09:32.183 --> 00:09:34.613
timing was perfect for Nero.

00:09:35.873 --> 00:09:38.493
Britannicus, Claudius’ biological

00:09:38.493 --> 00:09:41.063
son, was still too young to rule.

00:09:41.953 --> 00:09:45.133
Nero, by contrast, was seventeen,

00:09:45.443 --> 00:09:47.363
married to Claudius’ daughter,

00:09:47.673 --> 00:09:50.548
and already adopted as his heir.

00:09:51.393 --> 00:09:53.233
Agrippina had the Praetorian

00:09:53.243 --> 00:09:55.683
Guard on side, and the Senate

00:09:55.833 --> 00:09:57.333
fell quickly into line.

00:09:58.413 --> 00:10:00.813
At just seventeen years old, the boy

00:10:00.813 --> 00:10:04.063
Lucius became emperor Nero of Rome.

00:10:05.146 --> 00:10:07.476
Now, a seventeen-year-old emperor

00:10:07.476 --> 00:10:10.066
with no military experience and

00:10:10.066 --> 00:10:12.346
no political record might sound

00:10:12.346 --> 00:10:14.016
like a recipe for disaster.

00:10:14.706 --> 00:10:16.806
And in the long run, it was.

00:10:17.316 --> 00:10:19.176
But at the very beginning,

00:10:19.366 --> 00:10:21.016
things looked more promising.

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:23.256
Nero’s accession was

00:10:23.256 --> 00:10:25.146
greeted with widespread joy.

00:10:25.686 --> 00:10:28.966
The memory of Caligula’s madness was still

00:10:28.976 --> 00:10:31.826
fresh, and Claudius, though perfectly

00:10:31.866 --> 00:10:34.946
competent, had been seen as dull and

00:10:35.026 --> 00:10:37.560
dominated by his wives and freedmen.

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:42.106
Nero, by contrast, was young, handsome,

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:45.520
descended from Augustus, and backed by

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:48.190
a powerful group of well-known advisers.

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:52.580
On one side was his mother, Agrippina,

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:55.170
who had schemed and fought her way

00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:57.760
to this moment, and who seems to have

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:00.190
intended to rule through her son.

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:04.390
On the other side were two men who would

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:07.140
become household names in Roman history:

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:11.320
Seneca, the Stoic philosopher, and Burrus,

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:13.760
the commander of the Praetorian Guard.

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:16.990
And for the first few years

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:19.480
of Nero’s reign this trio

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:21.630
effectively governed the empire.

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:24.360
And they did it…pretty well.

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:28.010
This was a period that later writers

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:31.580
would nostalgically call the quinquennium

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:34.430
Neronis, the “five good years of Nero”.

00:11:35.353 --> 00:11:38.260
Nero cut taxes, eased the financial

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.290
burdens on the provinces, and

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:43.150
even banned secret trials, a clear

00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:45.295
rejection of the paranoia that had

00:11:45.295 --> 00:11:47.320
characterised the rule of Tiberius

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.990
and, of course, his own uncle Caligula.

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:53.450
He insisted that no one could be

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:55.730
condemned without the Senate’s approval,

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:58.860
and he declared that he wanted to end

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:00.940
the practice of capital punishment.

00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:05.020
This sounded almost like the voice of a

00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:08.710
philosopher-king, and that wasn’t far off.

00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:11.990
His tutor, Seneca, had filled his head

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.150
with Stoic ideals, lofty talk about

00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:18.670
clemency, virtue, and good governance.

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:22.090
And it seemed that Nero was

00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:23.580
putting them into practice.

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:25.620
Things were looking up.

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:28.770
And he wasn’t only popular with the

00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:31.970
elite; the Roman people also adored him.

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:35.850
He gave them games and spectacles,

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:38.640
but also a sense of relief.

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:41.940
After years of instability, they

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:44.260
had a young emperor who appeared

00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:47.410
gentle, approachable, even merciful.

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:50.790
Statues of him went up all across

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:53.570
the empire, coins bore his handsome

00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:56.250
young face, and poets praised him

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:59.260
as the dawn of a new golden age.

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:02.590
But even in these golden years,

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:05.000
there were hints of what was to come.

00:13:06.026 --> 00:13:09.110
Nero’s true passions were not in the

00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:11.660
Senate chamber or on the battlefield,

00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:15.160
but on the stage and in the circus.

00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:18.170
He wrote poetry, practised

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:20.420
singing and acting, and even

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:22.490
took lessons in chariot racing.

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.350
By all accounts, he was quite

00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:26.970
good at these pursuits, and

00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:28.460
took them pretty seriously.

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:33.500
But to Rome’s elite, this was scandalous;

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:37.220
emperors were supposed to command armies,

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:40.270
not play music or rehearse tragedies.

00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:43.850
Actors and musicians, after all, were

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:46.370
at the bottom of society, in the same

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:49.600
category as gladiators and prostitutes.

00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:53.240
Still, the public lapped it up.

00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:56.270
Here was an emperor who mingled

00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:58.360
with the people, who enjoyed the

00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:59.860
same entertainments they did,

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.470
who seemed almost one of them.

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:05.720
And what’s more, one who seemed to

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.650
be running Rome pretty effectively.

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:10.360
But behind the scenes,

00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:12.230
things were not so calm.

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:14.460
His mother, Agrippina,

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:15.660
was growing restless.

00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:18.450
She believed Nero owed everything

00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:20.430
to her: his throne, his

00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:22.240
marriage, his very survival.

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:25.510
She expected to share power, to

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:28.014
be listened to, to be obeyed.

00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:31.320
But she found herself increasingly

00:14:31.523 --> 00:14:33.970
sidelined by the men in Nero’s

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:36.020
life: Seneca and Burrus.

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:38.510
She pushed back, demanding more

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:40.830
influence, reminding Nero of

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.940
everything that she had done for him.

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:46.140
And this tension between

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:48.260
mother and son soon escalated.

00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:50.200
A particular flashpoint

00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:51.940
came over a love affair.

00:14:52.806 --> 00:14:55.100
Nero was married at the time, but

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.643
shortly after he became emperor,

00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:00.000
he became infatuated with a

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.830
former slave named Claudia Acte.

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:05.910
Agrippina was horrified.

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:09.420
To her, it was not just a disgrace,

00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:12.760
the emperor of Rome lowering himself

00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:14.416
to consort with a freedwoman,

00:15:14.713 --> 00:15:17.340
but a threat to her own position.

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:21.240
If Acte gained influence, Agrippina’s

00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:23.890
grip on her son would weaken even further.

00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:27.560
According to the historian Tacitus,

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:30.450
Agrippina’s fury was such that she even

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:33.670
tried to intimidate Nero by reminding him

00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:36.135
that Britannicus, the biological son of

00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:39.110
Claudius, was still alive, was soon coming

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:42.880
of age, and might one day stake his claim.

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:46.460
That was a dangerous card to play.

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:49.160
Dangerous for Britannicus, at least.

00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:53.380
In AD 55, the young boy was at a

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:56.050
banquet with the imperial family when

00:15:56.050 --> 00:15:59.175
he suddenly collapsed, gasping for air.

00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:01.640
He died on the spot.

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:05.910
Tacitus says he was poisoned on Nero’s

00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:09.120
orders, just days before he was due to

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:11.910
put on the toga virilis and formally

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:14.280
become an adult in the eyes of Rome.

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:18.150
Now, whether Britannicus truly

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.650
posed a threat or not, he was gone.

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:23.970
And with his death, one

00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:25.400
more rival was removed.

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:28.730
Whether it was because he now felt more

00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:31.510
secure in his position and didn’t need her

00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:34.180
anymore, or whether it was because he felt

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:36.600
she had overstepped the mark, we can only

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:39.900
hypothesise, but Agrippina’s influence

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:42.640
over her son continued to decline.

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:45.640
She no longer sat beside

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:47.400
him at public ceremonies.

00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:50.130
Her face was removed from the front

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:52.340
of Roman coins and relegated to the

00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:55.500
back, then it was removed altogether.

00:16:56.730 --> 00:16:59.270
And she was banished from the palace.

00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:01.630
Her power was ebbing

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:03.340
away, and she knew it.

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:07.230
Tacitus paints a vivid picture of her

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:09.360
trying to do everything she could to

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:12.310
claw it back, from scolding her son,

00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:14.360
attempting to win over the Praetorian

00:17:14.370 --> 00:17:17.480
Guard, even, at one point, hinting

00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:19.750
that she might champion someone else.

00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:22.910
But each move only

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:24.740
pushed Nero further away.

00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:27.650
By the time we reach the year AD

00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:30.960
58, Nero was openly defying her.

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:34.430
He was emperor in his own right now,

00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:36.830
and the struggle between mother and

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:39.790
son was heading towards its bloody

00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:42.100
conclusion, the one we began this

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:44.520
episode with, in Baiae, with sinking

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:47.370
boats, daggers, and a mother urging

00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:49.920
her assassins to stab her in the womb.

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:54.100
After Agrippina’s death, Nero was

00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:56.320
finally free of his mother’s shadow.

00:17:57.170 --> 00:17:59.200
But if he thought this would

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:01.940
win him peace of mind, and room

00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:03.830
to breathe, he was mistaken.

00:18:05.343 --> 00:18:07.240
His mother’s death was publicly

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:09.960
reported as suicide, self-destruction

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:11.750
after the discovery of her

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:14.360
supposed plot to overthrow her son.

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:18.380
But few in Rome bought this story.

00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:21.680
It was widely accepted that she had

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:24.180
been killed on the emperor’s orders.

00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:27.190
Now, this wouldn’t of course have been

00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:29.480
the first time an emperor had killed

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:32.010
someone who was inconvenient; Ancient

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:34.140
Rome was all about knocking off your

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:37.680
political rivals, current, past or future,

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:40.860
and it wasn’t particularly frowned upon.

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:44.210
But the difference was that killing your

00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:48.050
own mother was a step too far, even for

00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:50.940
the sometimes bloodthirsty ancient Romans.

00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:54.460
The Senate congratulated him, of course.

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:57.510
The Praetorian Guard swore their loyalty.

00:18:58.040 --> 00:18:59.740
Flattery was part of the job

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:01.690
description when dealing with emperors.

00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:06.230
Yet whispers spread across Rome: the

00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:08.520
young emperor had crossed a line.

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:13.690
And after Agrippina’s murder, something

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:17.690
flipped in Nero, or at least his behaviour

00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:21.140
became even more erratic and unusual.

00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:23.210
He became even more

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:25.160
obsessed with performance.

00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:27.920
He had always been a keen singer,

00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:30.710
actor, and poet, but became

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:33.420
utterly addicted to the crowd.

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:37.740
At first, he confined himself to

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:40.950
small audiences, singing or reciting

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:43.010
verses at private gatherings.

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:45.690
But soon he wanted more.

00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:48.310
He wanted to be seen, to be heard,

00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:50.260
to be cheered by the people.

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:54.240
The historian Suetonius tells us he

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:56.350
would lock audiences in the theatre

00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:58.340
until he had finished his performances,

00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:00.730
no matter how long they dragged on.

00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:05.220
For Rome’s elite, this was humiliating.

00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:07.770
To perform on stage was the

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:10.260
lowest of the low, an activity for

00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:13.050
slaves and actors, not emperors.

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:16.180
And while this was all going

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:18.560
on, costs of his various

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:21.140
extravagences continued to mount.

00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:25.340
Nero lavished money on games, spectacles,

00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:27.780
and extensive building projects.

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:30.683
He built a new wooden amphitheatre

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:33.610
for shows, and he spent huge sums

00:20:33.610 --> 00:20:37.030
on plays, music, and chariot races.

00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:40.690
The treasury, which had been healthy

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:42.710
under the fiscally conservative

00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:45.360
Claudius, began to creak under the

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:47.570
weight of his successor’s indulgence.

00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:53.450
And in July of AD 64, the city–and

00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:55.660
the empire–would face disaster.

00:20:57.150 --> 00:21:00.020
10 years into his rule, a huge

00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:02.780
fire broke out in the city of Rome.

00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:06.750
Fires were not uncommon in the

00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:08.490
crowded, wooden tenements of the

00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:11.330
capital, but this one was different.

00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:15.150
It raged for six days and seven nights,

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:17.880
destroying vast swathes of the city.

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:21.040
When at last it seemed to be

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:22.460
under control, it flared up

00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:25.090
again, lasting another three days.

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:29.050
There is no reliable record of how many

00:21:29.050 --> 00:21:32.670
people died, but what is certain is that

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:36.480
by the end, most of Rome lay in ruins.

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:40.300
Entire districts were gone, temples

00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:43.330
and public buildings reduced to ash,

00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:46.170
and thousands of people left homeless.

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:50.010
And where was Nero during all of this?

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:53.290
Well, there is this popular idea that

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:55.940
he was in Rome, looking over his burning

00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:58.950
capital, playing the fiddle, the violin.

00:22:00.273 --> 00:22:02.240
It might fit the characterisation

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:04.473
of Nero, but it isn’t true.

00:22:05.423 --> 00:22:07.453
For starters, the fiddle wasn’t

00:22:07.453 --> 00:22:10.593
invented for another 1,500 years.

00:22:10.903 --> 00:22:12.633
If he did anything, it would have

00:22:12.633 --> 00:22:16.123
been to play the lute or to sing, but

00:22:16.123 --> 00:22:18.353
there is no evidence that he did this.

00:22:19.353 --> 00:22:21.353
According to Tacitus, he was

00:22:21.383 --> 00:22:23.913
at his villa in Antium, by the

00:22:23.913 --> 00:22:25.793
coast, when the fire began.

00:22:26.733 --> 00:22:29.163
He rushed back to the city, opening

00:22:29.163 --> 00:22:32.003
up the Campus Martius, the imperial

00:22:32.003 --> 00:22:34.953
gardens, and even his own palace to

00:22:34.963 --> 00:22:36.803
shelter those who had lost their homes.

00:22:37.743 --> 00:22:40.033
He also arranged for food supplies

00:22:40.043 --> 00:22:42.113
to be brought in to prevent famine.

00:22:43.143 --> 00:22:45.862
But this was not the story that spread.

00:22:46.405 --> 00:22:49.273
Suetonius and later sources tell

00:22:49.273 --> 00:22:52.023
us that Nero stood on a tower, lyre

00:22:52.023 --> 00:22:54.703
in hand, watching Rome burn while

00:22:54.703 --> 00:22:56.503
singing about the fall of Troy.

00:22:57.612 --> 00:23:01.102
Tacitus, who wrote closer to the time, is

00:23:01.102 --> 00:23:03.692
more careful: he says only that there were

00:23:03.702 --> 00:23:06.152
rumours, and that people believed them.

00:23:07.332 --> 00:23:09.552
What does seem clear is that

00:23:09.552 --> 00:23:12.082
suspicion quickly turned on Nero.

00:23:13.022 --> 00:23:15.462
Some claimed he had ordered the fire

00:23:15.722 --> 00:23:18.142
to clear space for an ambitious new

00:23:18.142 --> 00:23:20.802
building project, the Domus Aurea,

00:23:20.952 --> 00:23:23.282
or “Golden House”, an enormous

00:23:23.352 --> 00:23:25.822
palace complex that would rise in

00:23:25.822 --> 00:23:27.702
the very heart of the destroyed city.

00:23:28.646 --> 00:23:31.856
This project did go ahead and it

00:23:31.856 --> 00:23:34.616
was breathtaking: artificial lakes,

00:23:34.826 --> 00:23:37.076
porticos stretching for hundreds of

00:23:37.076 --> 00:23:39.986
meters, halls glittering with gold and

00:23:39.986 --> 00:23:43.106
jewels, and a colossal statue of Nero.

00:23:43.574 --> 00:23:46.254
more than 30 metres high, standing

00:23:46.254 --> 00:23:48.054
like a god at the entrance.

00:23:49.654 --> 00:23:51.834
But as to whether the fire was

00:23:51.834 --> 00:23:54.934
started on Nero’s orders, most

00:23:54.934 --> 00:23:56.964
historians are pretty skeptical.

00:23:57.694 --> 00:23:59.774
Perhaps the fire was an

00:23:59.774 --> 00:24:00.924
unfortunate accident.

00:24:01.364 --> 00:24:03.394
Perhaps it was spread by looters.

00:24:03.874 --> 00:24:05.874
Or perhaps Nero’s men did set

00:24:05.874 --> 00:24:08.074
it, whether on his orders or not.

00:24:09.414 --> 00:24:11.564
What mattered was that people

00:24:11.704 --> 00:24:13.334
believed he was responsible.

00:24:14.054 --> 00:24:16.324
To deflect suspicion, Nero

00:24:16.344 --> 00:24:17.524
looked for scapegoats.

00:24:18.404 --> 00:24:21.304
He turned to a small and obscure

00:24:21.344 --> 00:24:23.944
sect in Rome: the Christians.

00:24:24.774 --> 00:24:27.364
They were accused of starting the fire,

00:24:27.654 --> 00:24:29.974
and subjected to brutal punishments.

00:24:30.694 --> 00:24:33.914
Some were torn apart by dogs, others

00:24:34.144 --> 00:24:36.964
were crucified, others burned alive

00:24:37.104 --> 00:24:39.154
to light Nero’s gardens at night.

00:24:39.834 --> 00:24:42.584
Grisly stuff indeed, especially

00:24:42.754 --> 00:24:44.324
because there is no evidence that

00:24:44.324 --> 00:24:46.424
Christians had anything to do with it.

00:24:47.894 --> 00:24:50.264
Unfortunately, this scapegoating

00:24:50.634 --> 00:24:53.094
seemed to work, at least temporarily.

00:24:53.674 --> 00:24:55.934
The public had been given a scalp,

00:24:56.344 --> 00:24:58.464
and this had satisfied their

00:24:58.494 --> 00:25:00.504
immediate thirst for a culprit.

00:25:01.594 --> 00:25:03.814
But still, Nero’s authority

00:25:03.844 --> 00:25:05.404
was far from stable.

00:25:06.214 --> 00:25:08.424
And in the years after the Great

00:25:08.434 --> 00:25:11.114
Fire, his private life became just

00:25:11.134 --> 00:25:13.304
as notorious as his public one.

00:25:14.764 --> 00:25:16.824
He had been married, since the

00:25:16.824 --> 00:25:19.044
age of sixteen, to Octavia,

00:25:19.194 --> 00:25:20.892
the daughter of Claudius.

00:25:21.464 --> 00:25:23.834
She was popular with the Roman people:

00:25:24.074 --> 00:25:27.084
modest, dutiful, the very picture

00:25:27.094 --> 00:25:29.430
of the traditional Roman matron.

00:25:29.964 --> 00:25:32.214
But Nero despised her.

00:25:33.014 --> 00:25:35.484
He accused her of infertility,

00:25:35.644 --> 00:25:37.784
neglected her, and eventually,

00:25:37.874 --> 00:25:40.898
in AD 62, divorced her.

00:25:42.084 --> 00:25:44.394
Only days later, he married

00:25:44.394 --> 00:25:46.514
his mistress, Poppaea Sabina.

00:25:47.584 --> 00:25:50.974
She was ambitious, glamorous, and

00:25:51.194 --> 00:25:52.774
had previously been married to

00:25:52.814 --> 00:25:55.584
Otho, a friend of Nero’s who would

00:25:55.584 --> 00:25:58.064
later, briefly, be emperor himself.

00:25:59.284 --> 00:26:01.194
The Roman people did not take

00:26:01.234 --> 00:26:03.324
kindly to Octavia’s dismissal.

00:26:04.084 --> 00:26:06.494
There were public protests demanding

00:26:06.494 --> 00:26:09.024
her return, and statues of her

00:26:09.154 --> 00:26:10.894
were paraded through the streets.

00:26:12.274 --> 00:26:15.484
Nero’s response was ruthless: he

00:26:15.484 --> 00:26:18.004
charged her with adultery, which

00:26:18.144 --> 00:26:20.214
she was almost certainly not guilty

00:26:20.214 --> 00:26:23.504
of, and had her executed in exile.

00:26:24.304 --> 00:26:26.124
There is even an account that

00:26:26.124 --> 00:26:28.504
her head was brought to Poppea,

00:26:28.844 --> 00:26:31.164
Nero’s new wife, as proof.

00:26:32.544 --> 00:26:34.764
And if Poppea thought that

00:26:34.764 --> 00:26:36.279
Nero would be nicer to her,

00:26:36.684 --> 00:26:38.444
she would be sorely mistaken.

00:26:39.634 --> 00:26:44.134
According to Tacitus, in AD 65, while she

00:26:44.134 --> 00:26:47.719
was pregnant, Nero grew so angry with her

00:26:47.994 --> 00:26:50.954
that he kicked her to death, reportedly

00:26:51.154 --> 00:26:53.534
aiming his blows at her stomach to

00:26:53.534 --> 00:26:56.744
ensure he also killed their unborn child.

00:26:57.801 --> 00:26:59.731
And I’m sorry to say that it

00:26:59.731 --> 00:27:02.621
gets, if it can do, even worse.

00:27:03.111 --> 00:27:04.441
Or at least, no better.

00:27:05.601 --> 00:27:08.691
After Poppaea’s death, Nero spotted a

00:27:08.691 --> 00:27:11.781
young boy, Sporus, in the streets of Rome.

00:27:12.681 --> 00:27:14.581
He decided that the young

00:27:14.581 --> 00:27:16.331
boy was the spitting image

00:27:16.411 --> 00:27:18.121
of his dead, murdered, wife.

00:27:18.811 --> 00:27:21.051
He ordered for the boy to be brought

00:27:21.121 --> 00:27:25.021
to his palace, castrated, dressed up as

00:27:25.021 --> 00:27:28.631
his dead wife, and then married to Nero.

00:27:29.931 --> 00:27:32.031
Seriously grisly stuff indeed.

00:27:33.191 --> 00:27:35.411
By this time, there was widespread

00:27:35.411 --> 00:27:38.591
consensus that Nero was unfit to rule.

00:27:39.631 --> 00:27:42.951
The same year, AD 65, there was a plot

00:27:43.031 --> 00:27:45.921
to assassinate him, a plot involving an

00:27:45.941 --> 00:27:49.121
influential senator called Piso and even,

00:27:49.441 --> 00:27:52.401
reportedly, Nero’s close advisor, Seneca.

00:27:53.571 --> 00:27:56.011
But the conspiracy was betrayed

00:27:56.191 --> 00:27:57.961
before it could be put into action.

00:27:58.831 --> 00:28:00.331
And the repression that

00:28:00.331 --> 00:28:01.691
followed was brutal.

00:28:02.331 --> 00:28:04.351
Dozens were executed or

00:28:04.351 --> 00:28:06.111
forced to commit suicide.

00:28:07.061 --> 00:28:10.371
Piso took his own life, and Seneca was

00:28:10.391 --> 00:28:13.131
ordered to open his veins, dying in a

00:28:13.141 --> 00:28:15.861
bath while dictating calm philosophical

00:28:15.861 --> 00:28:17.691
reflections to his students, the

00:28:17.921 --> 00:28:20.381
very image of Stoic resignation.

00:28:21.551 --> 00:28:23.531
The conspiracy and its bloody

00:28:23.531 --> 00:28:25.521
suppression marked a turning point.

00:28:26.011 --> 00:28:28.161
Nero no longer pretended

00:28:28.341 --> 00:28:29.681
to govern with restraint.

00:28:30.281 --> 00:28:33.359
He ruled through fear, with spies and

00:28:33.359 --> 00:28:35.471
informers everywhere, and trials for

00:28:35.471 --> 00:28:37.411
treason filling the Senate’s time.

00:28:38.731 --> 00:28:40.931
And at the same time, he leaned

00:28:40.941 --> 00:28:42.431
further into his passions:

00:28:42.701 --> 00:28:45.051
performance, theatre, and spectacle.

00:28:45.901 --> 00:28:48.681
In AD 66 he travelled to Greece,

00:28:48.851 --> 00:28:51.291
competing in chariot races, singing,

00:28:51.501 --> 00:28:53.791
and acting in public contests.

00:28:54.401 --> 00:28:56.811
The judges, of course, awarded him

00:28:56.811 --> 00:28:59.531
victory in every event, but the sight

00:28:59.531 --> 00:29:01.911
of the emperor of Rome prancing on

00:29:01.911 --> 00:29:04.681
stage further enraged the aristocracy.

00:29:06.211 --> 00:29:08.781
And when Nero returned from Greece,

00:29:08.991 --> 00:29:11.261
crowned with laurels and declaring

00:29:11.281 --> 00:29:15.221
he had won over 1,800 prizes, his

00:29:15.221 --> 00:29:17.801
popularity in Rome was lower than ever.

00:29:18.951 --> 00:29:21.371
By the late 60s AD, Nero’s

00:29:21.401 --> 00:29:23.031
grip on power was crumbling.

00:29:23.581 --> 00:29:25.411
The provinces were restless.

00:29:26.121 --> 00:29:28.751
The final blow came in AD 68.

00:29:29.771 --> 00:29:32.011
Nero ordered one of his governors,

00:29:32.301 --> 00:29:35.171
Gaius Julius Vindex, to raise taxes.

00:29:36.201 --> 00:29:38.901
Vindex, the governor of Gaul, not

00:29:38.941 --> 00:29:41.791
only refused, but rose up in revolt,

00:29:42.031 --> 00:29:44.481
declaring Nero unfit to rule.

00:29:45.611 --> 00:29:48.695
He was soon joined by Servius Sulpicius

00:29:48.695 --> 00:29:51.871
Galba, a governor in Spain, who positioned

00:29:51.871 --> 00:29:54.661
himself as a defender of Rome’s liberty.

00:29:55.381 --> 00:29:58.521
At first, Nero tried to rally support.

00:29:59.011 --> 00:30:01.761
He even talked of leading an army himself.

00:30:02.511 --> 00:30:04.981
But when news reached Rome

00:30:05.171 --> 00:30:07.101
that even the Praetorian Guard

00:30:07.311 --> 00:30:09.291
had deserted him, he panicked.

00:30:10.161 --> 00:30:12.721
The Senate declared him a public enemy,

00:30:13.021 --> 00:30:15.421
and orders were given for his arrest.

00:30:16.301 --> 00:30:18.431
Nero fled the city with a

00:30:18.451 --> 00:30:19.801
small group of freedmen.

00:30:21.021 --> 00:30:23.831
According to Suetonius, he wandered

00:30:23.861 --> 00:30:26.531
aimlessly, begging one of them to find

00:30:26.531 --> 00:30:28.201
a quiet place where he could hide.

00:30:29.191 --> 00:30:31.081
At last he took refuge

00:30:31.101 --> 00:30:32.891
in a villa outside Rome.

00:30:33.957 --> 00:30:36.501
There, hearing the sound of horsemen

00:30:36.521 --> 00:30:38.831
approaching, he realised it was over.

00:30:40.021 --> 00:30:42.811
Suetonius tells us he hesitated,

00:30:43.181 --> 00:30:44.661
begging his slaves to kill him.

00:30:45.851 --> 00:30:47.071
They refused.

00:30:47.791 --> 00:30:49.991
Finally, realising that there

00:30:49.991 --> 00:30:52.301
was no escape from here, he drove

00:30:52.301 --> 00:30:54.201
a dagger into his own throat.

00:30:55.811 --> 00:30:58.563
His last words, supposedly, were

00:30:58.821 --> 00:31:00.931
“Qualis artifex pereo” — “What

00:31:00.931 --> 00:31:02.631
an artist dies in me.”

00:31:03.881 --> 00:31:06.547
It was June AD 68.

00:31:06.848 --> 00:31:09.531
Nero was thirty years old, and

00:31:09.531 --> 00:31:11.917
with his death the Julio-Claudian

00:31:11.917 --> 00:31:15.071
dynasty, the line of Augustus, ended.

00:31:16.291 --> 00:31:19.281
As for his legacy, Nero has become

00:31:19.281 --> 00:31:22.511
a byword for excess and cruelty: the

00:31:22.511 --> 00:31:25.141
emperor who killed his mother, murdered

00:31:25.141 --> 00:31:27.081
his wife, persecuted Christians,

00:31:27.351 --> 00:31:29.575
and played music while Rome burned.

00:31:30.609 --> 00:31:33.661
But as with Caligula, so much of what

00:31:33.661 --> 00:31:36.511
we “know” about him comes from hostile

00:31:36.521 --> 00:31:39.331
sources, written years after his death.

00:31:40.171 --> 00:31:43.077
Tacitus, Suetonius, Cassius Dio, they

00:31:43.087 --> 00:31:46.077
all had their own agendas, and wanted

00:31:46.077 --> 00:31:48.857
to present Nero in the worst possible

00:31:48.857 --> 00:31:51.807
way, so as to present the emperors that

00:31:51.807 --> 00:31:54.717
came after him in a more positive light.

00:31:55.777 --> 00:31:59.067
So, Nero, was he Rome’s ultimate

00:31:59.077 --> 00:32:01.267
villain, or a young man who

00:32:01.267 --> 00:32:02.577
was never fit for power?

00:32:03.637 --> 00:32:05.197
If seems that the answer

00:32:05.207 --> 00:32:06.707
is “a bit of both”.

00:32:07.507 --> 00:32:09.967
If the ancient historians are to be

00:32:09.967 --> 00:32:12.747
taken at face value, he did monstrous

00:32:12.747 --> 00:32:15.507
things, but we must remember that

00:32:15.507 --> 00:32:17.697
it was very convenient for him to

00:32:17.697 --> 00:32:19.877
be cast as a monster and a tyrant.

00:32:20.697 --> 00:32:22.907
And, he was hardly the first.

00:32:23.667 --> 00:32:26.727
In Caligula we saw how rumour, scandal,

00:32:26.727 --> 00:32:28.847
and fear turned an emperor into a

00:32:28.857 --> 00:32:31.027
monster in the public imagination.

00:32:31.657 --> 00:32:34.767
With Nero, we saw it again: a young man

00:32:34.977 --> 00:32:36.947
who began his reign with promises of

00:32:36.947 --> 00:32:40.077
clemency and good government, yet is

00:32:40.077 --> 00:32:42.697
remembered forever as a sadistic tyrant.

00:32:43.637 --> 00:32:45.397
In our next and final episode in

00:32:45.397 --> 00:32:47.427
this mini-series, we will turn to

00:32:47.427 --> 00:32:50.477
Commodus, the son of Marcus Aurelius.

00:32:51.147 --> 00:32:53.297
Unlike Caligula or Nero, he

00:32:53.297 --> 00:32:56.017
inherited a stable empire, ruled

00:32:56.207 --> 00:32:57.927
by his philosopher-emperor father.

00:32:58.817 --> 00:33:01.107
But Commodus would squander that

00:33:01.117 --> 00:33:03.997
legacy, descending into megalomania,

00:33:04.073 --> 00:33:06.867
gladiatorial fantasies, and a cruelty

00:33:07.077 --> 00:33:09.627
that shocked even a jaded Roman world.

00:33:10.407 --> 00:33:12.387
And that, my friends, is what we

00:33:12.387 --> 00:33:14.197
have waiting for us next time.

00:33:16.077 --> 00:33:17.917
OK, then, that is it for

00:33:17.917 --> 00:33:19.867
today's episode on Nero.

00:33:20.137 --> 00:33:21.477
I hope it's been an interesting one

00:33:21.717 --> 00:33:23.387
and that you've learnt something new.

00:33:24.127 --> 00:33:25.937
As a final reminder in case it

00:33:25.947 --> 00:33:27.917
hadn’t sunk in yet, this was part

00:33:27.967 --> 00:33:30.007
two of a three-part mini-series.

00:33:30.307 --> 00:33:32.627
The first one was on Caligula, and next

00:33:32.627 --> 00:33:34.477
up we are going to meet an emperor with

00:33:34.557 --> 00:33:37.406
even fewer redeeming qualities, Commodus.

00:33:38.107 --> 00:33:39.907
You've been listening to English Learning

00:33:39.907 --> 00:33:42.547
for Curious Minds by Leonardo English.

00:33:42.997 --> 00:33:45.797
I'm Alastair Budge, you stay safe, and

00:33:45.797 --> 00:33:48.217
I'll catch you in the next episode.
