Hello, hello, hello, and welcome

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:09.560
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.370
Minds, by Leonardo English, the show

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.100
where you can listen to fascinating

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.510
stories and learn weird and wonderful

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.540
things about the world at the same

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.380
time as improving your English.

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.700
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is part

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.530
three of our three-part mini-series

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.070
on the theme of “Modern Egypt”.

00:00:29.438 --> 00:00:31.587
In case you missed them, in part one,

00:00:31.807 --> 00:00:33.847
we talked about the Egyptian Revolution,

00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:36.326
the circumstances leading up to it,

00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:39.396
what actually happened, and how, in many

00:00:39.396 --> 00:00:42.376
ways, it fell short of its lofty ideals.

00:00:42.716 --> 00:00:45.246
In part two, we talked about the New

00:00:45.426 --> 00:00:48.046
Administrative Capital, the city Egypt

00:00:48.046 --> 00:00:49.826
is trying to build in the desert,

00:00:50.082 --> 00:00:53.127
and how its critics suggest that it

00:00:53.127 --> 00:00:55.157
is about more than urban planning.

00:00:55.537 --> 00:00:58.407
And in today’s episode, part three, we

00:00:58.407 --> 00:01:00.857
are going to talk about the murder of

00:01:00.857 --> 00:01:03.868
an Italian PhD student called Giulio

00:01:03.868 --> 00:01:06.697
Regeni, a young man who lost his life

00:01:06.707 --> 00:01:09.437
in a horrific way, almost certainly

00:01:09.617 --> 00:01:12.147
at the hands of the Egyptian state.

00:01:12.917 --> 00:01:14.827
Just as a little disclaimer before

00:01:14.827 --> 00:01:17.257
we start, this episode will have

00:01:17.257 --> 00:01:19.447
some descriptions that some listeners

00:01:19.447 --> 00:01:21.817
might find unsettling, because the

00:01:21.827 --> 00:01:23.757
subject matter is pretty nasty,

00:01:23.937 --> 00:01:26.417
so please take this as a polite

00:01:26.457 --> 00:01:28.157
warning before we get started.

00:01:28.767 --> 00:01:31.487
And also, this episode will assume that

00:01:31.487 --> 00:01:33.677
you’ve listened to part one, on the

00:01:33.677 --> 00:01:36.117
Egyptian Revolution, or at least you know

00:01:36.137 --> 00:01:38.327
quite a bit about that period, as I’ll be

00:01:38.327 --> 00:01:41.247
referencing some key people from that era.

00:01:41.697 --> 00:01:43.877
So, with that out of the way,

00:01:44.067 --> 00:01:46.187
let’s get started and talk about

00:01:46.197 --> 00:01:48.281
the murder of Giulio Regeni.

00:01:49.967 --> 00:01:52.417
If you walk around the city of Trieste,

00:01:52.577 --> 00:01:54.997
in north-eastern Italy, you might

00:01:54.997 --> 00:01:57.377
be surprised at some of the banners

00:01:57.547 --> 00:01:59.537
you see hanging from the windows.

00:02:00.507 --> 00:02:03.147
One you see just off the main square

00:02:03.217 --> 00:02:06.207
reads, “Free Territory of Trieste”,

00:02:06.587 --> 00:02:08.527
with the subheader, in English, I

00:02:08.527 --> 00:02:12.807
should add, “USA AND UK COME BACK!”

00:02:13.797 --> 00:02:16.797
This is a nod to the unusual period

00:02:16.977 --> 00:02:20.127
after World War II, when the city and

00:02:20.127 --> 00:02:22.597
its surrounding area wasn’t part of

00:02:22.627 --> 00:02:25.757
Italy; it was its own, “free state”,

00:02:26.034 --> 00:02:28.144
administered by the Allied countries,

00:02:28.544 --> 00:02:30.774
a little like post-war Berlin.

00:02:31.797 --> 00:02:34.997
This poster is more of a historical

00:02:35.017 --> 00:02:37.377
curiosity, of course; there are few

00:02:37.407 --> 00:02:39.917
calling for an actual split with Italy

00:02:40.067 --> 00:02:42.007
and the return of British and American

00:02:42.007 --> 00:02:45.497
troops, but it is an important reminder of

00:02:45.497 --> 00:02:48.317
this unusual period in the city’s history.

00:02:49.677 --> 00:02:51.867
Another poster that you see around the

00:02:51.867 --> 00:02:55.647
city is no mere historical curiosity.

00:02:56.707 --> 00:02:59.644
In big black letters against a yellow

00:02:59.654 --> 00:03:03.394
background, it reads “Verità per Giulio

00:03:03.394 --> 00:03:06.704
Regeni” - “Truth for Giulio Regeni”,

00:03:07.194 --> 00:03:09.564
or you might translate it as something

00:03:09.564 --> 00:03:12.744
like “Giulio Regeni Deserves The Truth”.

00:03:14.684 --> 00:03:17.994
Next year, it will be 10 years since this

00:03:17.994 --> 00:03:22.084
man was last seen alive, and although some

00:03:22.114 --> 00:03:24.894
truth has come to light, unfortunately,

00:03:25.224 --> 00:03:27.694
justice has not been served.

00:03:29.034 --> 00:03:32.429
So, what is known about Giulio Regeni?

00:03:32.884 --> 00:03:37.139
He was born in Trieste, in Italy, in 1988.

00:03:37.683 --> 00:03:40.644
He studied abroad, in Leeds and Cambridge

00:03:40.644 --> 00:03:43.264
in the UK, and in Vienna, in Austria,

00:03:43.634 --> 00:03:46.394
and became particularly interested in

00:03:46.394 --> 00:03:48.674
the burgeoning political movements in

00:03:48.674 --> 00:03:51.614
the Middle East, particularly in Egypt.

00:03:53.044 --> 00:03:56.144
As part of his PhD at Cambridge,

00:03:56.444 --> 00:03:59.054
he travelled to Egypt to research

00:03:59.124 --> 00:04:01.434
trade unions, which he thought

00:04:01.674 --> 00:04:04.164
could be a fundamental part of new

00:04:04.364 --> 00:04:06.194
democratic movements in the country.

00:04:07.194 --> 00:04:10.764
Trade unions were highly regulated under

00:04:10.764 --> 00:04:14.294
Mubarak, but when his regime fell, there

00:04:14.294 --> 00:04:16.554
was a growing feeling that workers'

00:04:16.554 --> 00:04:19.404
rights now had the chance to improve,

00:04:19.754 --> 00:04:22.164
and with this, there was a growth in

00:04:22.164 --> 00:04:24.864
the number and strength of trade unions.

00:04:25.604 --> 00:04:28.174
But, as you’ll remember from part one,

00:04:28.594 --> 00:04:31.534
just three years after Mubarak resigned,

00:04:31.808 --> 00:04:35.445
in 2014, Egypt got another military

00:04:35.445 --> 00:04:38.442
dictator in the form of General Abdel

00:04:38.442 --> 00:04:41.345
Fattah el-Sisi, or Sisi for short.

00:04:42.375 --> 00:04:46.035
The police state was back, and Sisi

00:04:46.325 --> 00:04:48.875
and his secret police kept a close

00:04:48.925 --> 00:04:51.715
eye on Egypt’s growing trade unions.

00:04:53.105 --> 00:04:55.415
This was the environment in which

00:04:55.425 --> 00:04:57.765
Regeni found himself when he moved

00:04:57.815 --> 00:05:00.795
to Cairo in September of 2015.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.556
It wasn’t his first

00:05:02.566 --> 00:05:03.926
time in Egypt, mind you.

00:05:04.216 --> 00:05:06.506
He had spent time there as an intern

00:05:06.536 --> 00:05:09.976
for the United Nations back in 2013,

00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:12.396
during the military coup against Morsi,

00:05:12.666 --> 00:05:15.556
so he was no stranger to Egyptian life.

00:05:16.657 --> 00:05:19.936
Regeni initially focussed his research

00:05:20.016 --> 00:05:22.806
on trade unions for street vendors.

00:05:23.736 --> 00:05:25.966
Like in much of the Middle East, there

00:05:25.966 --> 00:05:28.826
is a huge informal economy in Egypt,

00:05:29.176 --> 00:05:32.316
and there are an estimated 5 to 6

00:05:32.386 --> 00:05:34.986
million street vendors in the country.

00:05:35.876 --> 00:05:38.786
These street vendors, who would lug their

00:05:38.786 --> 00:05:41.506
wares to and fro every morning and try

00:05:41.516 --> 00:05:42.816
to make enough money by the end of the

00:05:42.816 --> 00:05:45.626
day to support their family, well, they

00:05:45.626 --> 00:05:48.086
were clearly in a precarious position.

00:05:49.292 --> 00:05:51.512
You’ll remember Mohamed Bouazizi

00:05:51.532 --> 00:05:54.372
from part one, the Tunisian street

00:05:54.382 --> 00:05:56.534
vendor who set himself on fire in

00:05:56.534 --> 00:05:59.184
December of 2010 after being habitually

00:05:59.184 --> 00:06:01.291
abused and extorted by the police.

00:06:02.221 --> 00:06:05.261
As individuals, these street vendors

00:06:05.281 --> 00:06:07.655
were powerless against Egypt’s

00:06:07.771 --> 00:06:11.331
police state, but as a group, as a

00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:14.051
trade union, well, they were in a

00:06:14.071 --> 00:06:16.371
somewhat stronger bargaining position.

00:06:17.641 --> 00:06:20.581
This was the focus of Regeni’s research.

00:06:21.026 --> 00:06:23.746
And this wasn’t desk-based research,

00:06:23.956 --> 00:06:26.256
him sitting at home on a laptop or

00:06:26.466 --> 00:06:28.456
leafing through books in the library.

00:06:28.866 --> 00:06:31.206
He was out in the streets, going

00:06:31.206 --> 00:06:33.136
to trade union meetings, getting

00:06:33.136 --> 00:06:34.696
to know the people involved.

00:06:35.116 --> 00:06:38.516
It was proper, in-person field research.

00:06:40.069 --> 00:06:41.719
Most of the people he dealt with

00:06:41.999 --> 00:06:44.409
were, reportedly, very friendly.

00:06:45.109 --> 00:06:47.679
Egyptians have a reputation in the

00:06:47.679 --> 00:06:49.929
Arab world for being friendly and

00:06:49.929 --> 00:06:53.119
welcoming, and for the most part, this

00:06:53.129 --> 00:06:55.399
seems to have been Regeni’s experience.

00:06:55.989 --> 00:06:58.309
He had got into a few sticky

00:06:58.309 --> 00:07:00.119
situations, where people had

00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:02.589
pressured him for money, but it was

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:04.259
nothing he hadn’t bargained for.

00:07:05.269 --> 00:07:07.839
The research was going well, and

00:07:07.999 --> 00:07:10.209
after five months in Cairo, he was

00:07:10.209 --> 00:07:11.779
coming to the end of his time there.

00:07:12.599 --> 00:07:14.269
In fact, he had already

00:07:14.279 --> 00:07:16.349
booked a plane ticket back.

00:07:17.529 --> 00:07:21.639
And then, at 7.41 pm on the 25th of

00:07:21.639 --> 00:07:24.669
January–the fifth anniversary of the

00:07:24.669 --> 00:07:28.119
2011 uprising–he sent a text to his

00:07:28.129 --> 00:07:30.639
long-distance girlfriend, telling her

00:07:30.919 --> 00:07:33.259
he was going out to meet some friends.

00:07:34.779 --> 00:07:36.349
His friends waited for him.

00:07:37.139 --> 00:07:37.819
And waited.

00:07:38.639 --> 00:07:39.289
And waited.

00:07:40.739 --> 00:07:41.739
He never arrived.

00:07:42.679 --> 00:07:45.099
His friends grew worried and started

00:07:45.099 --> 00:07:48.189
calling around, but no one had seen him.

00:07:49.019 --> 00:07:51.449
His family back in Italy got involved,

00:07:51.669 --> 00:07:54.719
and soon the Italian embassy in Cairo was

00:07:54.759 --> 00:07:56.989
pressing Egyptian authorities for answers.

00:07:57.999 --> 00:08:00.479
Had he been kidnapped by Islamic

00:08:00.479 --> 00:08:03.059
radicals, and he would appear on a grainy

00:08:03.059 --> 00:08:05.246
video being beheaded in the desert?

00:08:05.629 --> 00:08:07.679
Had he been robbed and

00:08:07.699 --> 00:08:08.799
thrown into the Nile?

00:08:09.666 --> 00:08:11.826
For eight long days, there

00:08:11.826 --> 00:08:14.346
was nothing—just silence.

00:08:15.576 --> 00:08:18.976
Then, on February the 3rd, a bus

00:08:18.976 --> 00:08:21.766
driver on the Cairo-Alexandria desert

00:08:21.766 --> 00:08:25.629
highway–about 130km away from where Regeni

00:08:25.706 --> 00:08:29.066
was last seen–slammed on the brakes.

00:08:29.763 --> 00:08:32.349
He got out of the truck, and in a

00:08:32.369 --> 00:08:34.969
ditch by the side of the road, he

00:08:34.969 --> 00:08:37.449
found Giulio Regeni’s dead body.

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:40.269
He was naked from the waist down,

00:08:40.519 --> 00:08:42.529
and his body showed signs of

00:08:42.529 --> 00:08:44.189
having been horrifically beaten.

00:08:45.259 --> 00:08:47.493
His body bore the marks of

00:08:47.569 --> 00:08:49.979
unimaginable cruelty: cigarette

00:08:49.979 --> 00:08:52.609
burns, broken bones, cuts all over

00:08:52.609 --> 00:08:55.459
his skin, and his teeth smashed in.

00:08:56.749 --> 00:08:59.219
This was all before the blow that’s

00:08:59.219 --> 00:09:01.499
believed to have killed him: a blow to

00:09:01.499 --> 00:09:03.629
the back of his neck, fracturing his

00:09:03.629 --> 00:09:06.479
spine, and putting him out of his misery.

00:09:07.479 --> 00:09:10.119
His body was so battered that his

00:09:10.129 --> 00:09:11.779
mother could barely recognise him;

00:09:12.119 --> 00:09:13.689
she was only able to determine it

00:09:13.689 --> 00:09:15.939
was him by the tip of his nose.

00:09:17.229 --> 00:09:21.169
This wasn’t a random act of violence;

00:09:21.469 --> 00:09:23.939
it had all the hallmarks of something

00:09:23.999 --> 00:09:26.229
deliberate, something professional.

00:09:27.539 --> 00:09:29.729
The discovery was just the beginning

00:09:29.979 --> 00:09:31.849
of a mystery that only deepened.

00:09:32.519 --> 00:09:36.299
So, what happened between that text on

00:09:36.299 --> 00:09:39.869
the evening of January 25 and the moment

00:09:39.989 --> 00:09:42.539
his body was found on February 3rd?

00:09:42.779 --> 00:09:45.269
What happened in those eight days?

00:09:46.653 --> 00:09:49.773
The Egyptian authorities had some answers,

00:09:50.163 --> 00:09:52.083
none of them particularly convincing.

00:09:52.883 --> 00:09:54.483
They first claimed he had

00:09:54.493 --> 00:09:56.073
died in a traffic accident.

00:09:56.453 --> 00:09:57.863
Hit by a car, they said.

00:09:58.703 --> 00:10:01.303
That story fell apart fast when the

00:10:01.333 --> 00:10:04.633
autopsy showed torture, not tyre marks.

00:10:05.233 --> 00:10:07.513
Then they suggested it was a robbery

00:10:07.513 --> 00:10:10.579
gone wrong or maybe a personal dispute.

00:10:11.133 --> 00:10:13.643
Perhaps Regeni was gay, they said,

00:10:13.813 --> 00:10:16.003
and this was a crime of passion.

00:10:16.823 --> 00:10:19.673
He had met up with a man for sex,

00:10:19.743 --> 00:10:21.593
perhaps even a man who was hiding

00:10:21.593 --> 00:10:23.993
his homosexuality, and out of

00:10:23.993 --> 00:10:26.299
shame, he had murdered Regeni.

00:10:26.953 --> 00:10:28.173
That’s why he wasn’t wearing

00:10:28.173 --> 00:10:29.613
any trousers,  that’s why he

00:10:29.613 --> 00:10:31.373
was naked from the waist down.

00:10:32.673 --> 00:10:34.843
This was ridiculous, Regeni’s

00:10:34.853 --> 00:10:36.573
friends and family protested.

00:10:36.643 --> 00:10:38.863
He wasn’t gay, he had a girlfriend,

00:10:38.863 --> 00:10:41.143
and what’s more, this level

00:10:41.153 --> 00:10:43.463
of barbarity didn’t match any

00:10:43.463 --> 00:10:45.393
kind of “crime of passion”.

00:10:46.849 --> 00:10:49.019
Then, the Egyptian authorities

00:10:49.279 --> 00:10:51.269
suggested yet more possibilities.

00:10:52.169 --> 00:10:54.779
Perhaps he was a drug addict, and

00:10:54.979 --> 00:10:56.729
this was a drug deal gone wrong?

00:10:57.841 --> 00:10:58.866
Few believed them.

00:10:59.976 --> 00:11:02.206
A few weeks later the authorities

00:11:02.246 --> 00:11:04.426
even floated the idea that

00:11:04.426 --> 00:11:06.266
he’d been killed by a gang of

00:11:06.286 --> 00:11:08.516
criminals who targeted foreigners.

00:11:09.006 --> 00:11:11.776
He had been abducted, they said, tortured

00:11:11.986 --> 00:11:14.816
for his material posessions, and when they

00:11:14.816 --> 00:11:17.546
found out that he was a mere PhD student,

00:11:17.856 --> 00:11:20.096
they killed him and dumped his body.

00:11:21.156 --> 00:11:23.953
The Egyptians even had the names and

00:11:23.963 --> 00:11:27.256
details of the gang, but, and here

00:11:27.256 --> 00:11:28.963
is where it gets particularly fishy,

00:11:29.413 --> 00:11:32.243
unfortunately, they had all been killed in

00:11:32.243 --> 00:11:34.943
a police shootout a few weeks beforehand.

00:11:35.593 --> 00:11:38.363
The Egyptian authorities knew that

00:11:38.373 --> 00:11:40.709
this criminal gang was guilty because

00:11:40.709 --> 00:11:42.699
the police had raided the gang’s

00:11:42.699 --> 00:11:46.476
apartment and “ found” Regeni’s personal

00:11:46.486 --> 00:11:49.136
belongings, including his passport.

00:11:50.066 --> 00:11:52.066
Now, there is a lot about this

00:11:52.096 --> 00:11:54.906
particular theory that doesn’t stack up.

00:11:55.935 --> 00:11:58.216
Firstly, there are eyewitness accounts

00:11:58.216 --> 00:11:59.776
of the shooting of the gang members

00:12:00.046 --> 00:12:02.856
that suggest there was no shootout;

00:12:03.211 --> 00:12:06.311
the police shot them, then dragged

00:12:06.381 --> 00:12:08.451
them back into their van to make

00:12:08.451 --> 00:12:10.491
it look like it was a shootout.

00:12:11.561 --> 00:12:14.721
These people, whether real gang members

00:12:14.761 --> 00:12:17.391
or not, were murdered by the police.

00:12:18.481 --> 00:12:20.811
And it gets even more fishy.

00:12:21.521 --> 00:12:24.187
On the date of Regeni’s disappearance, the

00:12:24.187 --> 00:12:27.217
leader of this gang wasn’t even in Cairo,

00:12:27.537 --> 00:12:29.577
so he couldn’t have been responsible.

00:12:31.107 --> 00:12:34.547
And if this gang wasn’t responsible

00:12:34.587 --> 00:12:37.267
for Regeni’s murder, how did the police

00:12:37.577 --> 00:12:40.917
“find” his passport in their apartment?

00:12:41.527 --> 00:12:44.867
And if his mother even had trouble

00:12:44.867 --> 00:12:47.267
recognising her son’s body, how did

00:12:47.267 --> 00:12:49.447
the Egyptian authorities immediately

00:12:49.447 --> 00:12:51.791
know the dead man was Regeni?

00:12:53.177 --> 00:12:55.194
It looked like an increasingly

00:12:55.214 --> 00:12:58.514
messy cover-up, and all fingers

00:12:58.794 --> 00:13:00.934
pointed at the Egyptian state.

00:13:02.434 --> 00:13:04.954
After all, the way the young researcher

00:13:05.074 --> 00:13:07.464
was tortured matched a pattern.

00:13:08.134 --> 00:13:11.044
Human rights activists had long documented

00:13:11.244 --> 00:13:13.444
how Sisi’s regime dealt with perceived

00:13:13.444 --> 00:13:16.004
threats: activists, journalists,

00:13:16.314 --> 00:13:18.374
anyone asking too many questions.

00:13:18.924 --> 00:13:20.924
They would disappear into secret

00:13:20.944 --> 00:13:23.834
detention centres, often called “black

00:13:23.844 --> 00:13:26.634
sites,” where they’d be interrogated,

00:13:26.924 --> 00:13:29.251
tortured, and often murdered.

00:13:30.621 --> 00:13:34.394
And, unfortunately, this was what Regeni’s

00:13:34.394 --> 00:13:36.817
family and the Italian authorities

00:13:36.917 --> 00:13:39.067
immediately thought had happened to him.

00:13:40.487 --> 00:13:42.681
After all, he would almost certainly

00:13:42.857 --> 00:13:44.947
have been on the Egyptian police’s radar.

00:13:45.457 --> 00:13:47.837
He wasn’t just studying trade unions

00:13:47.837 --> 00:13:50.517
from afar; he was meeting people,

00:13:50.877 --> 00:13:52.717
asking questions about wages,

00:13:53.007 --> 00:13:55.647
working conditions, and how these

00:13:55.647 --> 00:13:57.547
vendors felt about the government.

00:13:58.387 --> 00:14:00.207
These were all things that were

00:14:00.207 --> 00:14:02.527
very dangerous in Sisi’s Egypt.

00:14:03.647 --> 00:14:05.257
And indeed, the Egyptian

00:14:05.287 --> 00:14:07.487
authorities then admitted that,

00:14:07.957 --> 00:14:11.027
yes, they were watching Regeni.

00:14:12.187 --> 00:14:14.857
It turned out that one of the leaders

00:14:14.997 --> 00:14:17.337
of a trade union that Regeni was

00:14:17.337 --> 00:14:20.647
affiliated with was a police informant.

00:14:21.427 --> 00:14:23.587
He was passing on information to

00:14:23.587 --> 00:14:26.017
the Egyptian secret police, and

00:14:26.127 --> 00:14:28.577
a few weeks prior to Regeni’s

00:14:28.607 --> 00:14:31.147
disappearance, he had told them

00:14:31.527 --> 00:14:34.047
that he thought Regeni was a spy.

00:14:35.587 --> 00:14:37.887
And Regeni had been followed

00:14:37.927 --> 00:14:39.567
and tracked by the secret police

00:14:39.827 --> 00:14:41.677
for a few weeks at a minimum.

00:14:42.267 --> 00:14:44.007
He had noticed a woman taking a

00:14:44.007 --> 00:14:46.077
photo of him at a trade union event

00:14:46.267 --> 00:14:49.247
a few weeks prior, and he sensed that

00:14:49.247 --> 00:14:51.037
he might have been being followed.

00:14:52.357 --> 00:14:54.777
The Egyptian state admitted as much

00:14:54.827 --> 00:14:56.841
but claimed that they had only tracked

00:14:56.841 --> 00:14:59.261
him for a few days before coming

00:14:59.261 --> 00:15:02.181
to the conclusion that he was not

00:15:02.181 --> 00:15:04.811
a spy; he was no-one of importance.

00:15:05.621 --> 00:15:08.801
Back in Italy, Regeni’s family and friends

00:15:09.171 --> 00:15:12.831
were heartbroken but determined to get

00:15:12.841 --> 00:15:16.271
some kind of justice, some form of truth.

00:15:17.231 --> 00:15:18.821
They teamed up with human

00:15:18.821 --> 00:15:20.521
rights lawyers and pressured

00:15:20.731 --> 00:15:22.871
the Italian government to act.

00:15:23.842 --> 00:15:26.684
In Italy, “Verità per Giulio Regeni”

00:15:27.014 --> 00:15:30.284
became a rallying cry; those yellow

00:15:30.304 --> 00:15:33.008
banners started popping up everywhere, not

00:15:33.008 --> 00:15:35.678
just in Trieste but across the country.

00:15:36.758 --> 00:15:39.058
The Italian government recalled its

00:15:39.058 --> 00:15:41.398
ambassador from Cairo in protest

00:15:41.618 --> 00:15:44.508
and demanded a proper investigation.

00:15:45.488 --> 00:15:47.778
They pressed for more evidence that

00:15:47.938 --> 00:15:50.198
might help unravel the mystery, such

00:15:50.198 --> 00:15:52.788
as CCTV footage from outside the

00:15:52.788 --> 00:15:54.858
metro station where he was last seen.

00:15:55.668 --> 00:15:57.760
Mysteriously, this evidence

00:15:57.832 --> 00:16:00.595
went missing or was refused on

00:16:00.595 --> 00:16:02.295
the grounds of data protection.

00:16:03.741 --> 00:16:06.081
As the years ticked by, a

00:16:06.081 --> 00:16:07.781
few things became clearer.

00:16:09.011 --> 00:16:12.702
In 2017, Italian prosecutors started

00:16:12.712 --> 00:16:15.032
building a case, pointing the finger

00:16:15.242 --> 00:16:17.972
at Egypt’s National Security Agency.

00:16:19.252 --> 00:16:21.472
They identified four Egyptian

00:16:21.472 --> 00:16:23.862
security officers as suspects,

00:16:24.162 --> 00:16:26.142
accusing them of kidnapping,

00:16:26.592 --> 00:16:29.012
torturing, and murdering Regeni.

00:16:30.342 --> 00:16:31.872
Witnesses came forward, too.

00:16:32.442 --> 00:16:34.822
One said he’d overheard an Egyptian

00:16:34.822 --> 00:16:36.832
policeman bragging about grabbing

00:16:37.152 --> 00:16:39.392
“the Italian” at a metro station.

00:16:40.162 --> 00:16:42.522
Another claimed Regeni had been

00:16:42.522 --> 00:16:44.672
betrayed by someone close to his

00:16:44.672 --> 00:16:47.442
research, possibly a trade union

00:16:47.442 --> 00:16:50.262
contact pressured into informing on him.

00:16:50.952 --> 00:16:53.492
There was even video footage of this

00:16:53.492 --> 00:16:56.202
man trying to get money from Regeni,

00:16:56.482 --> 00:16:59.242
which was used against Regeni to try

00:16:59.292 --> 00:17:01.402
to put forward the idea that he was a

00:17:01.412 --> 00:17:04.362
spy and was trying to buy information.

00:17:05.962 --> 00:17:08.822
But Egypt wouldn’t cooperate.

00:17:09.512 --> 00:17:11.322
Those officers were never

00:17:11.402 --> 00:17:13.352
questioned, let alone arrested.

00:17:14.392 --> 00:17:15.512
And they weren’t just

00:17:15.622 --> 00:17:17.162
any security officers.

00:17:17.655 --> 00:17:20.935
Their names were Major General Tarek

00:17:20.935 --> 00:17:23.495
Saber and Major Sherif Magdy, who

00:17:23.495 --> 00:17:25.955
were both high-ranking members of

00:17:25.955 --> 00:17:28.055
Egypt’s National Security Agency.

00:17:29.005 --> 00:17:31.425
And they named two high-ranking members

00:17:31.425 --> 00:17:33.575
of the police force, too: Colonel

00:17:33.725 --> 00:17:36.515
Hesham Helmy and Colonel Acer Kamal.

00:17:37.695 --> 00:17:40.155
These were not random, rogue

00:17:40.175 --> 00:17:42.615
officers who picked up a foreigner

00:17:42.765 --> 00:17:44.505
and gave him a bit of a beating.

00:17:44.875 --> 00:17:47.225
They were high-ranking officers of

00:17:47.225 --> 00:17:50.105
the Egyptian state, and the fact that

00:17:50.105 --> 00:17:52.815
they were being so protected suggests

00:17:52.975 --> 00:17:55.035
that senior leaders in Egypt were

00:17:55.045 --> 00:17:57.423
fully aware of what was going on.

00:17:58.323 --> 00:18:00.793
And here’s where it gets murkier still.

00:18:02.283 --> 00:18:05.293
Mahmoud Sisi, the son of General

00:18:05.323 --> 00:18:07.533
Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, the President of

00:18:07.533 --> 00:18:10.413
Egypt, was the deputy head of one of

00:18:10.413 --> 00:18:13.263
Egypt’s main secret police agencies.

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:17.540
Now, this is not to suggest that Regeni

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:20.100
was murdered on the direct orders of

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:22.920
Mahmoud Sisi, or his father, the Egyptian

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:25.780
president, but that it seems highly

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:28.970
likely they know exactly what happened

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:31.760
and may even have given the order to

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:34.680
protect these men and bury the truth.

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:37.870
Still, this didn’t stop the Italian

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:40.010
authorities from trying to find it.

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:45.117
Finally, in 2021, the case went to trial.

00:18:45.667 --> 00:18:48.567
An Italian court tried to prosecute

00:18:48.807 --> 00:18:51.797
those four Egyptian officers in absentia,

00:18:52.127 --> 00:18:53.817
without them appearing in court.

00:18:54.657 --> 00:18:56.997
But the case never went anywhere.

00:18:57.557 --> 00:19:00.027
Of course, the men accused denied

00:19:00.037 --> 00:19:02.517
everything and didn’t attend the trial.

00:19:03.417 --> 00:19:05.907
The Egyptian authorities said there

00:19:05.907 --> 00:19:07.847
was insufficient evidence, they

00:19:07.847 --> 00:19:10.647
refused to extradite the men, and they

00:19:10.647 --> 00:19:13.177
even refused to provide their home

00:19:13.217 --> 00:19:15.867
addresses or any way of contacting them.

00:19:17.307 --> 00:19:20.047
What’s more, the defense claimed

00:19:20.277 --> 00:19:22.487
there was no evidence that these men

00:19:22.527 --> 00:19:24.687
even knew that they were on trial.

00:19:26.297 --> 00:19:29.357
This seemed bizarre, as the case was

00:19:29.407 --> 00:19:31.807
all over the news, the Egyptian state

00:19:32.067 --> 00:19:33.727
could clearly have informed them if

00:19:33.727 --> 00:19:36.697
they wanted, and the men had denied

00:19:36.737 --> 00:19:39.747
committing the crime, but the law is the

00:19:39.757 --> 00:19:42.230
law - there was no definitive proof that

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:45.330
the men knew they were being tried, so

00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:48.130
legally the trial could not continue.

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:52.630
This was in 2021, and it was a bitter

00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:55.030
blow to Regeni’s family, and for

00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:58.060
justice, for truth for Giulio Regeni.

00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:02.170
But there has since been some progress.

00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:06.480
In September of 2023, Italy’s top

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:08.860
court ruled that the men could

00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:11.440
stand trial, despite the lack of

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:13.690
cooperation from Egyptian authorities.

00:20:14.485 --> 00:20:16.693
A trial resumed in February

00:20:16.693 --> 00:20:19.733
last year, February of 2024, but

00:20:20.043 --> 00:20:22.563
it too has not gone anywhere.

00:20:23.563 --> 00:20:25.703
The defense for the men claimed

00:20:25.943 --> 00:20:27.613
there is still no evidence that the

00:20:27.623 --> 00:20:29.623
men know they are on trial, their

00:20:29.623 --> 00:20:31.893
addresses or whereabouts are still

00:20:31.923 --> 00:20:34.803
unknown, and the court didn’t even

00:20:34.803 --> 00:20:36.773
know if the men were still alive.

00:20:37.893 --> 00:20:40.203
According to the lawyer assigned to

00:20:40.203 --> 00:20:42.203
defend them, “They are absolutely

00:20:42.567 --> 00:20:45.603
untraceable”, and even if they were

00:20:45.623 --> 00:20:47.873
convicted, they would “certainly

00:20:47.893 --> 00:20:49.433
not serve their sentences”.

00:20:50.873 --> 00:20:53.353
The probability of true justice

00:20:53.663 --> 00:20:55.573
ever coming for Giulio Regeni

00:20:55.803 --> 00:20:58.293
is, unfortunately, minimal.

00:20:59.561 --> 00:21:02.427
And despite the banners that hang from

00:21:02.427 --> 00:21:05.637
windows in Trieste, and all over Italy for

00:21:05.637 --> 00:21:08.547
that matter, normal diplomatic relations

00:21:08.707 --> 00:21:11.573
between Italy and Egypt have resumed.

00:21:12.983 --> 00:21:15.513
Egypt has become the biggest buyer

00:21:15.607 --> 00:21:18.333
of Italian weapons, with a billion

00:21:18.333 --> 00:21:20.973
Euros of weapons being sold by Italian

00:21:20.973 --> 00:21:23.163
companies to the Egyptian state.

00:21:24.213 --> 00:21:26.807
Just a few kilometres to the west of

00:21:26.807 --> 00:21:29.877
Trieste, and in fact very close to the

00:21:29.877 --> 00:21:32.897
village where Regeni grew up, is a small

00:21:32.897 --> 00:21:36.207
town called Monfalcone, which is the home

00:21:36.387 --> 00:21:39.197
of the shipbuilding company, Fincantieri.

00:21:40.407 --> 00:21:42.677
If you go to the Fincantieri website,

00:21:43.087 --> 00:21:45.647
you can find press releases proudly

00:21:45.647 --> 00:21:48.577
boasting of multimillion-dollar contracts

00:21:48.867 --> 00:21:51.537
providing ships to the Egyptian navy,

00:21:51.877 --> 00:21:54.417
selling weapons to the military that

00:21:54.447 --> 00:21:57.157
almost certainly murdered a young man

00:21:57.327 --> 00:21:59.507
who grew up just a few kilometres away.

00:22:00.824 --> 00:22:04.217
It is a cruel irony, but so long as

00:22:04.227 --> 00:22:07.407
the banners remain, and his name is not

00:22:07.407 --> 00:22:10.307
forgotten, there is still a slither of

00:22:10.317 --> 00:22:13.730
possibility for justice for Giulio Regeni.

00:22:15.657 --> 00:22:18.427
OK then, that is it for today's episode

00:22:18.667 --> 00:22:20.447
on the state-sponsored murder of Giulio

00:22:20.447 --> 00:22:23.457
Regeni, and with it comes the end of this

00:22:23.467 --> 00:22:25.997
three-part mini-series on modern Egypt.

00:22:26.427 --> 00:22:27.693
I hope it's been an interesting one,

00:22:27.943 --> 00:22:29.483
and that you've learnt something new.

00:22:30.083 --> 00:22:31.803
As always, I would love to know

00:22:31.803 --> 00:22:33.183
what you thought of this episode.

00:22:33.583 --> 00:22:34.793
Did you know about the case

00:22:34.793 --> 00:22:36.403
of Giulio Regeni before this?

00:22:36.823 --> 00:22:38.803
Do you think justice will ever be served?

00:22:39.153 --> 00:22:40.453
And what ideas do you

00:22:40.453 --> 00:22:41.803
have for more mini-series?

00:22:42.003 --> 00:22:43.674
I would love to know, so let’s

00:22:43.674 --> 00:22:44.964
get this discussion started.

00:22:45.194 --> 00:22:46.244

00:22:46.244 --> 00:22:47.834

00:22:58.434 --> 00:23:01.264

00:23:01.264 --> 00:23:03.674
