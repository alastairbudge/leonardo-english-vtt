Hello, hello, hello, and welcome

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.889
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:12.669
Minds, by Leonardo English, the show

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:14.450
where you can listen to fascinating

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.049
stories and learn weird and wonderful

00:00:17.059 --> 00:00:19.230
things about the world at the same

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.090
time as improving your English.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.310
I'm Alastair Budge, and today it’s

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.720
the start of another three-part

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.220
mini-series, this time on the

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.129
theme of citizenship and identity.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.749
In part one, today’s episode, we are

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.980
going to talk about the case of Italy

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.370
and the country’s recent referendum

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.050
on easing the rules on citizenship.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.059
In part two, we’ll talk about the

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:49.150
Windrush scandal, a recent British

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.700
political scandal in which tens of

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.169
thousands of people, mostly from

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.800
former British colonies in the

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.425
Caribbean, found themselves treated

00:00:58.645 --> 00:01:01.085
as outcasts in their own country.

00:01:01.675 --> 00:01:04.205
And in part three, we will talk about

00:01:04.215 --> 00:01:06.455
the battle between the Mediterranean

00:01:06.495 --> 00:01:09.645
island of Malta and the European Union, a

00:01:09.655 --> 00:01:13.115
battle for the right to sell citizenship.

00:01:14.053 --> 00:01:17.063
OK then, let’s get right into it, and

00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:20.183
ask ourselves what makes an Italian.

00:01:21.383 --> 00:01:23.793
Now I want to start this episode

00:01:24.043 --> 00:01:26.123
by telling you something about me.

00:01:27.083 --> 00:01:29.107
It’s not a secret, and I’m

00:01:29.107 --> 00:01:30.677
certainly not ashamed of it.

00:01:31.237 --> 00:01:33.627
But it’s not something that everyone

00:01:33.627 --> 00:01:35.837
knows, and it’s not something

00:01:35.837 --> 00:01:37.387
that’s immediately obvious.

00:01:38.007 --> 00:01:39.407
It’s not something that you

00:01:39.407 --> 00:01:41.177
would guess by looking at me.

00:01:41.817 --> 00:01:43.047
It’s not something that you

00:01:43.047 --> 00:01:44.717
would guess by hearing my voice.

00:01:45.197 --> 00:01:46.707
It’s not something that you would

00:01:46.717 --> 00:01:49.117
guess if I told you about my parents,

00:01:49.337 --> 00:01:51.297
my brother and sister, my cousins,

00:01:51.687 --> 00:01:53.637
or anything about my childhood.

00:01:54.337 --> 00:01:57.677
It’s this: I am Italian.

00:01:58.727 --> 00:02:01.657
I have an Italian passport; I am,

00:02:02.127 --> 00:02:04.557
legally speaking at least, as Italian

00:02:04.817 --> 00:02:07.297
as Giorgio Armani or Sophia Loren.

00:02:08.157 --> 00:02:11.617
And in fact, I am more Italian than tens

00:02:11.627 --> 00:02:13.947
of thousands of people who were born and

00:02:13.947 --> 00:02:16.437
raised in Italy, who speak no language

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:19.647
other than Italian, know no other country

00:02:19.647 --> 00:02:22.747
but Italy, but are not Italian citizens.

00:02:23.887 --> 00:02:26.067
I have Italian citizenship

00:02:26.277 --> 00:02:27.267
through marriage.

00:02:27.517 --> 00:02:29.607
My wife is Italian, which allowed

00:02:29.617 --> 00:02:31.717
me to become an Italian citizen.

00:02:32.537 --> 00:02:34.587
There are a few technicalities to

00:02:34.587 --> 00:02:37.527
this–different waiting periods depending

00:02:37.527 --> 00:02:39.397
on whether you live in Italy or not,

00:02:39.747 --> 00:02:41.887
and whether you have children, and

00:02:41.887 --> 00:02:43.497
then you have to pass a language test

00:02:43.497 --> 00:02:46.587
and not have a criminal record–but in

00:02:46.587 --> 00:02:49.437
my case at least, I was eligible to

00:02:49.437 --> 00:02:52.227
become an Italian citizen after three

00:02:52.237 --> 00:02:54.767
years of marriage, despite not living

00:02:54.767 --> 00:02:57.257
or working in Italy or having any

00:02:57.257 --> 00:02:59.987
connection to Italy apart from my wife.

00:03:01.057 --> 00:03:03.867
Interestingly enough, for my wife, the

00:03:03.867 --> 00:03:06.947
reverse is not true; it is significantly

00:03:06.947 --> 00:03:09.437
more difficult and expensive for her

00:03:09.637 --> 00:03:12.137
to become a UK citizen than it is

00:03:12.137 --> 00:03:14.547
for me to become an Italian citizen.

00:03:15.667 --> 00:03:17.807
Now, especially for the Italians

00:03:17.827 --> 00:03:20.207
listening to this, you might think this

00:03:20.207 --> 00:03:22.217
is perfectly fair, you might think it

00:03:22.217 --> 00:03:25.707
is grossly unfair, but it is the law.

00:03:26.907 --> 00:03:29.297
As you will know, a country has

00:03:29.297 --> 00:03:31.757
the right to set its laws on

00:03:31.787 --> 00:03:34.127
who is entitled to citizenship.

00:03:35.067 --> 00:03:38.437
At birth, citizenship is typically granted

00:03:38.727 --> 00:03:42.097
based either on jus soli, where a child

00:03:42.127 --> 00:03:43.767
becomes a citizen of the country they

00:03:43.767 --> 00:03:46.727
were born in, or jus sanguinis, where

00:03:46.727 --> 00:03:48.747
the child becomes a citizen by blood,

00:03:48.957 --> 00:03:50.797
because their mother or father was a

00:03:50.797 --> 00:03:53.437
citizen, or some combination of the two.

00:03:54.557 --> 00:03:57.657
Most countries in the Americas, like the

00:03:57.657 --> 00:04:01.123
US, Mexico and Brazil, prioritise jus

00:04:01.123 --> 00:04:04.317
soli, where anyone born in the country is

00:04:04.317 --> 00:04:07.467
a citizen, regardless of the citizenship

00:04:07.567 --> 00:04:10.107
of their parents, while most European

00:04:10.107 --> 00:04:13.127
countries–like Italy and the UK–are

00:04:13.167 --> 00:04:15.737
much more restrictive, and prioritise

00:04:16.057 --> 00:04:18.717
citizenship through descent; you become a

00:04:18.717 --> 00:04:21.667
citizen through ancestry, through blood.

00:04:23.117 --> 00:04:26.497
And globally, most countries also offer

00:04:26.517 --> 00:04:29.587
some form of pathway to citizenship,

00:04:29.848 --> 00:04:32.118
even if you weren’t born in that country

00:04:32.368 --> 00:04:34.948
or have no ancestry in that country.

00:04:36.028 --> 00:04:38.768
Typically, this is through either

00:04:38.778 --> 00:04:41.038
marriage, as it was in my case,

00:04:41.288 --> 00:04:43.487
or an extended period of time

00:04:43.687 --> 00:04:45.497
spent living in that country.

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:48.617
But there are other ways, such as the

00:04:48.627 --> 00:04:50.117
topic we’ll cover in part three of

00:04:50.117 --> 00:04:52.537
this mini-series: paying lots of money.

00:04:53.387 --> 00:04:56.297
In the case of Italy, the country has

00:04:56.327 --> 00:04:59.007
relatively loose restrictions when

00:04:59.007 --> 00:05:01.027
it comes to acquiring citizenship

00:05:01.307 --> 00:05:03.247
through ancestry or marriage,

00:05:03.617 --> 00:05:06.727
but much stricter rules regarding

00:05:06.727 --> 00:05:08.817
citizenship through residency.

00:05:09.957 --> 00:05:12.297
Or to translate that into plain English,

00:05:12.817 --> 00:05:15.177
I was able to become an Italian citizen

00:05:15.497 --> 00:05:17.847
after just three years of being married,

00:05:18.337 --> 00:05:21.607
but someone who was born in Italy and

00:05:21.747 --> 00:05:23.807
had lived in Italy their entire life

00:05:24.157 --> 00:05:26.307
but whose parents weren’t Italian

00:05:26.307 --> 00:05:29.577
citizens, well unless they had applied

00:05:29.597 --> 00:05:31.977
for citizenship between their 18th

00:05:32.197 --> 00:05:34.807
and 19th birthdays, they might find

00:05:34.807 --> 00:05:37.287
it very difficult to become Italian.

00:05:38.437 --> 00:05:40.627
And it was this that was one of the

00:05:40.627 --> 00:05:44.012
key focuses of a referendum put to the

00:05:44.012 --> 00:05:46.927
Italian public in early June this year.

00:05:47.977 --> 00:05:50.027
The referendum actually had 5

00:05:50.117 --> 00:05:52.757
questions, with 4 of them relating to

00:05:52.757 --> 00:05:55.197
labour laws, but the most important

00:05:55.197 --> 00:05:57.767
question was one on citizenship.

00:05:58.657 --> 00:06:01.577
The public was asked to vote on whether

00:06:01.577 --> 00:06:04.487
the time limit for non-EU citizens

00:06:04.517 --> 00:06:06.476
living in Italy to become Italian

00:06:06.476 --> 00:06:09.596
citizens should be reduced from 10

00:06:09.606 --> 00:06:12.559
years to 5 years, which would bring it

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:15.019
in line with other European countries,

00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:18.249
such as France, Germany, and the UK.

00:06:19.329 --> 00:06:22.409
Now, as a quick side note, Italy has

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:24.249
quite a strong tradition of holding

00:06:24.249 --> 00:06:26.679
referendums, and an equally strong

00:06:26.679 --> 00:06:29.649
tradition of those referendums failing to

00:06:29.649 --> 00:06:32.269
reach the required turnout rate of 50%.

00:06:32.819 --> 00:06:35.409
So they are often used more like

00:06:35.499 --> 00:06:38.259
political tools to express unhappiness

00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:40.699
at government policy and direction rather

00:06:40.699 --> 00:06:43.429
than genuine vehicles of political change.

00:06:44.459 --> 00:06:47.559
So, who exactly was pushing

00:06:47.579 --> 00:06:48.759
for this referendum?

00:06:49.569 --> 00:06:52.589
And perhaps more importantly, why now?

00:06:53.819 --> 00:06:56.489
Well, the short answer is: the political

00:06:56.489 --> 00:06:59.919
left, trade unions, and a coalition of

00:06:59.999 --> 00:07:02.659
pro-immigration and civil rights groups.

00:07:03.749 --> 00:07:06.799
Italy, like much of Europe, has seen

00:07:06.809 --> 00:07:09.359
significant immigration over the past

00:07:09.359 --> 00:07:12.023
30 years, and many of the children of

00:07:12.063 --> 00:07:14.713
these immigrants, these second-generation

00:07:14.713 --> 00:07:17.863
Italians, have grown up in Italy, speak

00:07:17.923 --> 00:07:21.013
only Italian, go to Italian schools, and

00:07:21.233 --> 00:07:24.193
consider themselves Italian in every way.

00:07:25.103 --> 00:07:27.211
But, in the eyes of the law,

00:07:27.941 --> 00:07:29.833
they're not; they are foreigners.

00:07:30.823 --> 00:07:32.983
For years, there have been growing

00:07:32.983 --> 00:07:35.113
calls to make it easier for these

00:07:35.113 --> 00:07:37.543
people to obtain Italian citizenship,

00:07:37.873 --> 00:07:40.303
to officially recognise their Italian

00:07:40.303 --> 00:07:43.343
identity, not just socially or culturally.

00:07:45.043 --> 00:07:47.583
Supporters of the reform argued

00:07:47.763 --> 00:07:50.613
that the existing system is unfair

00:07:50.873 --> 00:07:53.203
and out of touch with modern Italy.

00:07:54.113 --> 00:07:56.393
After all, they say, if someone has

00:07:56.403 --> 00:07:58.513
lived in Italy for most of their life,

00:07:58.733 --> 00:08:01.163
paid taxes, gone to school, speaks

00:08:01.163 --> 00:08:03.673
the language fluently, and calls Italy

00:08:03.673 --> 00:08:06.053
home, doesn’t this make them Italian?

00:08:07.283 --> 00:08:09.603
And this question of citizenship

00:08:09.863 --> 00:08:12.263
has also become wrapped up in

00:08:12.263 --> 00:08:14.683
wider debates about Italy’s ageing

00:08:14.723 --> 00:08:17.233
population and its future workforce.

00:08:18.393 --> 00:08:20.848
The country, as you may know, has

00:08:20.858 --> 00:08:22.658
one of the lowest birth rates in

00:08:22.658 --> 00:08:25.668
Europe, with 1.24 births per woman,

00:08:26.078 --> 00:08:28.098
and hundreds of thousands of young

00:08:28.098 --> 00:08:30.308
people leaving for other countries.

00:08:31.108 --> 00:08:34.548
Its population is ageing and shrinking,

00:08:35.018 --> 00:08:37.478
with a quarter of the population aged

00:08:37.518 --> 00:08:42.108
over 65 and just 12% under the age of 14.

00:08:43.418 --> 00:08:46.048
Its economy increasingly depends on

00:08:46.058 --> 00:08:48.488
migrant labour to keep key sectors

00:08:48.488 --> 00:08:51.118
running, everything from agriculture

00:08:51.148 --> 00:08:53.638
to elderly care to logistics.

00:08:54.948 --> 00:08:57.868
From this perspective, making it easier

00:08:58.038 --> 00:08:59.808
for long-term residents and their

00:08:59.808 --> 00:09:02.228
children to become citizens isn’t just

00:09:02.228 --> 00:09:04.428
a question of fairness, so the argument

00:09:04.438 --> 00:09:06.998
goes; it’s also a practical solution

00:09:07.258 --> 00:09:09.598
to a looming demographic crisis.

00:09:10.588 --> 00:09:13.158
In short, Italy needs more people,

00:09:13.518 --> 00:09:15.768
and many argue that it should

00:09:15.768 --> 00:09:18.078
start by giving citizenship to

00:09:18.078 --> 00:09:19.728
people who are already there.

00:09:20.968 --> 00:09:22.738
But, as you might expect,

00:09:23.068 --> 00:09:24.818
not everyone agrees.

00:09:25.588 --> 00:09:28.218
Opposition to the reform comes mainly

00:09:28.238 --> 00:09:30.558
from the right, where political leaders

00:09:30.568 --> 00:09:32.978
have consistently argued against any

00:09:32.988 --> 00:09:35.308
loosening of the rules around citizenship.

00:09:35.888 --> 00:09:38.098
For these parties, citizenship

00:09:38.458 --> 00:09:40.648
is not simply an administrative

00:09:40.648 --> 00:09:43.248
label, a matter of residency, or

00:09:43.358 --> 00:09:45.828
a tool to secure economic growth.

00:09:46.368 --> 00:09:48.648
It’s about identity, history,

00:09:49.228 --> 00:09:52.308
culture — and, in their eyes, about

00:09:52.308 --> 00:09:54.638
protecting what it means to be Italian.

00:09:55.738 --> 00:09:58.468
They argue that Italian identity is

00:09:58.468 --> 00:10:00.548
something inherited through blood

00:10:00.752 --> 00:10:03.493
and tradition, not simply acquired

00:10:03.713 --> 00:10:05.323
by living in the country for a few

00:10:05.323 --> 00:10:07.683
years and being able to correctly

00:10:07.683 --> 00:10:09.873
identify the difference between an

00:10:09.883 --> 00:10:12.043
espresso macchiato and a cappuccino.

00:10:13.343 --> 00:10:15.823
There’s also the question of control.

00:10:16.483 --> 00:10:19.233
Like in much of Europe, in Italy,

00:10:19.313 --> 00:10:20.983
immigration has been one of the

00:10:20.983 --> 00:10:22.993
most polarising political issues

00:10:23.173 --> 00:10:25.933
for years, particularly since the

00:10:25.933 --> 00:10:29.043
European migrant crisis of 2015.

00:10:30.723 --> 00:10:33.003
The right argues that relaxing

00:10:33.003 --> 00:10:35.873
citizenship rules could act as a pull

00:10:35.883 --> 00:10:38.393
factor, encouraging more immigration,

00:10:38.843 --> 00:10:40.766
and that the system should remain

00:10:40.776 --> 00:10:43.846
strict to prevent abuse and protect

00:10:43.866 --> 00:10:45.496
the country’s “social cohesion”.

00:10:46.906 --> 00:10:49.776
And beyond ideology, there is,

00:10:49.776 --> 00:10:51.756
of course, political calculation.

00:10:52.716 --> 00:10:54.146
The issue of citizenship

00:10:54.486 --> 00:10:56.566
divides public opinion quite

00:10:56.566 --> 00:10:58.596
neatly along political lines.

00:10:59.616 --> 00:11:02.076
For the right, opposing reforms like

00:11:02.076 --> 00:11:05.096
this is a way to mobilise their base,

00:11:05.176 --> 00:11:07.436
to present themselves as defenders of

00:11:07.456 --> 00:11:10.336
tradition, of the nation, of Italian

00:11:10.336 --> 00:11:12.906
values, however you might define those.

00:11:13.777 --> 00:11:16.740
And while supporters framed this reform

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:20.040
as modern, inclusive, and pragmatic,

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:22.840
opponents presented it as rushed,

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:25.350
dangerous, and as something that could

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:28.500
erode and dilute Italian identity.

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:31.330
So, what happened?

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:34.590
Well, the referendum, in the great

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:36.700
tradition of Italian referendums, was

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:39.935
declared void after only around 30% of

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:42.320
the eligible population turned up to vote.

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:47.870
Of those who voted, around 65% voted to

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:51.400
reduce the term limit, with 35% voting

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:54.180
against it, but this was to be expected;

00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:56.770
the Prime Minister, Giorgia Meloni,

00:11:56.835 --> 00:11:58.740
who was one of the major critics of the

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:01.610
proposal, encouraged her supporters to

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:04.620
boycott the referendum, so it was hardly

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:07.330
surprising that more “yes” supporters

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:09.850
turned up to vote than the “no” side.

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:12.960
And anyway, legally, a minimum

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:15.350
turnout of 50% is required for a

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:18.250
referendum to be binding, so the entire

00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:20.820
thing was declared null and void.

00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:24.850
The result was met with cheers by

00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:26.760
Meloni and her supporters on the

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:29.610
right, and with dismay by those who

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:31.270
had campaigned for the referendum,

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:33.650
who were mainly on the political left.

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:36.720
Now, without getting too dragged

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:38.900
into the topic of Italian politics,

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:40.950
I think it’s useful to look at this

00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:43.570
referendum and the case of Italy as an

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:46.190
example of the question of citizenship.

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:47.870
What makes one person

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:49.690
Italian and another not?

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:52.340
What does this mean, and what

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:54.320
implications does it have for

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:55.500
the future of the country?

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:59.520
In the case of Italy, the country has

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:02.550
historically had very generous rules

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:05.910
on citizenship by ancestry, by descent.

00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:08.800
In other words, there was a strong

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:11.380
preference for the idea that citizenship

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:13.920
is something that is passed down from

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:16.620
generation to generation, not easily

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:19.050
acquired by cultural assimilation.

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:23.850
In fact, until May of 2025,

00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:26.230
there were no generational limits

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:28.480
for jus sanguinis citizenship.

00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:32.390
Let’s say someone emigrated from Italy in

00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:36.210
1861–the year of unification–to America,

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:38.980
and they and all of their descendants

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:41.910
lived in the US, never setting foot in

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:44.540
Italy again and never speaking a word

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:47.140
of Italian, and to make it even more

00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:49.060
dramatic, let’s say they renounced

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:51.190
all Italian culture and traditional

00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:53.620
Italian food, and to make it even worse,

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:56.090
their favourite pizza was Hawaiian.

00:13:57.470 --> 00:14:01.570
Their descendant born in 2011, 150

00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:04.150
years later, could, if there was an

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:06.470
unbroken chain of direct relatives

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:08.010
who had claimed Italian citizenship,

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:11.120
also apply for Italian citizenship.

00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:14.610
If this sounds theoretical,

00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:15.970
it really isn’t.

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:19.520
An estimated 1.2 million people

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:22.030
in Argentina are Italian citizens,

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.790
including the President, Javier Milei,

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:27.360
who has never lived or worked in Italy.

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:30.560
Now, contrast this with the

00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:33.430
estimated 2.5 million foreigners

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:34.840
who have been living and working

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:37.100
in Italy for more than 5 years.

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:40.390
The recent referendum was about the

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:42.950
question of whether they should have

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:45.880
the right to Italian citizenship, and

00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:48.180
indirectly, whether their children

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:50.480
should also become Italian citizens.

00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:53.130
To give you an example, let’s say a

00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:55.450
couple from China have been living and

00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:58.270
working in Rome for the past 9 years.

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:01.140
They have no Italian ancestors or

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.790
heritage, but they speak fluent Italian,

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.920
they also have a couple of kids who were

00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:08.440
born and raised in Italy, and they can

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:11.170
correctly tell you what kind of pasta goes

00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:13.280
with what kind of sauce, and they would

00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:15.850
never dream of using cream in a carbonara.

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:20.160
If the referendum had passed, the couple

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:22.370
would have been able to apply for Italian

00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:24.860
citizenship, and their children could

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:27.000
become Italian, rather than having

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.290
to wait until they were 18 to apply.

00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:32.840
As you heard, the referendum didn’t

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:35.911
pass; it failed badly, and there

00:15:35.911 --> 00:15:37.661
are even suspicions that there will

00:15:37.661 --> 00:15:39.971
be another referendum on whether to

00:15:39.991 --> 00:15:43.131
raise the limit from 10 to 12 years,

00:15:43.441 --> 00:15:45.601
making it even more difficult to

00:15:45.621 --> 00:15:47.721
become a citizen by naturalisation.

00:15:49.181 --> 00:15:51.251
And of course, Italy isn’t

00:15:51.251 --> 00:15:52.911
the only country grappling

00:15:52.921 --> 00:15:54.251
with these kinds of questions.

00:15:54.941 --> 00:15:56.681
Take Germany, for example.

00:15:57.361 --> 00:15:59.771
Up until the year 2000, German

00:15:59.771 --> 00:16:02.051
citizenship law was based almost

00:16:02.051 --> 00:16:05.611
entirely on jus sanguinis, on ancestry.

00:16:06.851 --> 00:16:10.491
But in 2000, things started to change.

00:16:11.331 --> 00:16:14.081
Children born in Germany to foreign

00:16:14.081 --> 00:16:16.191
parents can now receive German

00:16:16.191 --> 00:16:17.711
citizenship, as long as their

00:16:17.711 --> 00:16:19.711
parents have been legal residents

00:16:19.811 --> 00:16:21.261
for a certain period of time.

00:16:22.231 --> 00:16:24.721
And the limit for citizenship by residency

00:16:24.921 --> 00:16:28.661
was reduced from 15 years to 8, and in

00:16:28.661 --> 00:16:32.481
2024, it was reduced again, to 5 years.

00:16:33.321 --> 00:16:35.351
In fact, my sister, who lives

00:16:35.351 --> 00:16:37.281
in Germany, is in the process

00:16:37.401 --> 00:16:39.051
of becoming a German citizen.

00:16:40.291 --> 00:16:43.257
France, for its part, has long operated

00:16:43.527 --> 00:16:45.707
under a more inclusive model, with

00:16:45.917 --> 00:16:48.627
automatic or semi-automatic citizenship

00:16:48.784 --> 00:16:50.747
for children born in France to foreign

00:16:50.747 --> 00:16:52.547
parents who have lived in the country.

00:16:53.077 --> 00:16:55.697
Even countries like Switzerland, which are

00:16:55.927 --> 00:16:58.097
traditionally seen as quite restrictive,

00:16:58.447 --> 00:17:01.157
have gradually eased their naturalisation

00:17:01.157 --> 00:17:03.677
rules for second-generation immigrants.

00:17:04.577 --> 00:17:07.767
Italy, by contrast, has held on tightly

00:17:07.767 --> 00:17:10.607
to the idea that citizenship is primarily

00:17:10.607 --> 00:17:12.687
something passed down through blood.

00:17:13.857 --> 00:17:16.457
And in many ways, this reflects

00:17:16.457 --> 00:17:17.987
the country’s own history.

00:17:18.887 --> 00:17:20.207
For most of its modern

00:17:20.217 --> 00:17:22.707
existence, Italy was a country

00:17:22.707 --> 00:17:25.247
of emigration, not immigration.

00:17:25.947 --> 00:17:28.397
Millions of Italians left for

00:17:28.607 --> 00:17:30.467
North and South America, for

00:17:30.607 --> 00:17:32.587
Australia, for parts of Europe.

00:17:33.207 --> 00:17:35.527
The Italian state made a conscious

00:17:35.557 --> 00:17:38.277
choice to maintain legal ties to these

00:17:38.277 --> 00:17:40.387
people and their descendants, even

00:17:40.597 --> 00:17:43.547
generations later — hence the extremely

00:17:43.557 --> 00:17:46.527
generous rules on citizenship by descent.

00:17:47.557 --> 00:17:50.737
But now, as Italy has become a country

00:17:50.737 --> 00:17:53.487
of immigration, with millions of people

00:17:53.487 --> 00:17:56.407
from Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and

00:17:56.407 --> 00:17:58.487
the Middle East settling and raising

00:17:58.487 --> 00:18:01.577
children in the country, this old legal

00:18:01.587 --> 00:18:04.347
framework is starting to show its cracks.

00:18:05.932 --> 00:18:09.221
And at its core, this is a debate

00:18:09.401 --> 00:18:11.841
about what citizenship really means.

00:18:12.661 --> 00:18:15.141
Is it a legal status passed down

00:18:15.141 --> 00:18:17.281
from your ancestors, even if you’ve

00:18:17.431 --> 00:18:18.921
never set foot in the country?

00:18:19.621 --> 00:18:22.521
Is it a reflection of cultural belonging,

00:18:22.531 --> 00:18:26.451
of language, school, work, and daily life?

00:18:27.201 --> 00:18:30.481
Or is it something else entirely, a

00:18:30.481 --> 00:18:33.641
contract, a symbol of participation, of

00:18:33.871 --> 00:18:36.531
being part of a shared national project?

00:18:37.901 --> 00:18:39.551
In the case of Italy, these

00:18:39.551 --> 00:18:41.831
questions remain unresolved.

00:18:42.481 --> 00:18:45.211
And, if the result of the referendum is

00:18:45.241 --> 00:18:47.421
anything to go by, they are likely to

00:18:47.421 --> 00:18:50.381
remain unresolved for some time to come.

00:18:51.721 --> 00:18:54.421
OK, then, that is it for today's episode

00:18:54.591 --> 00:18:56.781
on the question of Italian citizenship.

00:18:57.201 --> 00:18:59.091
To everyone, and especially to the

00:18:59.091 --> 00:19:00.761
Italians listening, I hope it was

00:19:00.761 --> 00:19:02.181
an interesting one and that you

00:19:02.181 --> 00:19:03.631
might have learnt something new.

00:19:04.275 --> 00:19:05.840
As always, I would love to know

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:07.230
what you thought of this episode.

00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:09.820
What do you think is “the right” way

00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:12.700
to define who becomes a citizen or not?

00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:15.180
Do I deserve my Italian citizenship,

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:17.320
or is the country handing

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:18.910
out passports too liberally?

00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:21.080
I would love to know, so let’s

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:22.470
get this discussion started.

00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:24.190
Let me know in the comments below,

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:25.960
if you're listening to this somewhere

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:27.910
where you can comment, and for the

00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:29.530
members among you, you can head right

00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:31.460
into our community forum, which is at

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:34.180
community.leonardoenglish.com and get

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:36.360
chatting away to other curious minds.

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:39.200
And as a final reminder, this is

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:41.570
part one of a three-part mini-series.

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:43.650
Next up we’ll be talking about the

00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:46.260
Windrush Scandal, and in part three

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:47.820
we’ll be looking at a country that

00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:49.500
wants to keep selling its passports

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:51.360
to the highest bidder, and talk about

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:53.720
Malta’s battle with the European Union.

00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:56.310
