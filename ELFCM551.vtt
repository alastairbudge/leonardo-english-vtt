Hello, hello, hello, and welcome

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.780
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.570
Minds, by Leonardo English, the show

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.379
where you can listen to fascinating

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.800
stories and learn weird and wonderful

00:00:16.809 --> 00:00:18.840
things about the world at the same

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.660
time as improving your English.

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.409
I'm Alastair Budge, and today

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.970
is part two of our three-part

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.310
mini-series on Modern Egypt.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.980
In part one, in case you missed

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.009
it, we talked about the Egyptian

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.480
Revolution, how Mubarak was toppled,

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.670
and how what ultimately came

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.949
next wasn’t all that different.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.670
In part three, we will talk about the

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.419
murder of the Italian PhD student,

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.406
Giulio Regeni, almost certainly at

00:00:48.406 --> 00:00:50.696
the hands of the Egyptian police.

00:00:51.406 --> 00:00:53.886
And today, in part two, we are

00:00:53.886 --> 00:00:56.136
going to talk about Egypt’s plan

00:00:56.316 --> 00:00:58.526
to build a new administrative

00:00:58.526 --> 00:01:01.049
capital in the middle of the desert.

00:01:01.506 --> 00:01:03.346
Is it bold and necessary?

00:01:03.666 --> 00:01:06.406
Is it foolish and a waste of money, or

00:01:06.616 --> 00:01:09.536
is it simply a way for President Sisi to

00:01:09.536 --> 00:01:12.126
make sure he doesn’t end up like Mubarak?

00:01:12.756 --> 00:01:15.756
Let’s not waste a minute and find out.

00:01:17.416 --> 00:01:19.136
It’s hard to overstate

00:01:19.386 --> 00:01:21.766
quite how big Cairo is.

00:01:22.446 --> 00:01:24.866
By some measures, it’s the sixth

00:01:24.946 --> 00:01:26.916
most populous city in the world,

00:01:27.146 --> 00:01:29.596
with over 21 million people.

00:01:30.626 --> 00:01:32.786
It’s also one of the world’s most

00:01:32.816 --> 00:01:35.236
densely populated cities, with

00:01:35.236 --> 00:01:38.516
the Cairo urban area having 10,000

00:01:38.516 --> 00:01:40.236
people per kilometre squared.

00:01:41.666 --> 00:01:43.566
As a point of reference, this

00:01:43.566 --> 00:01:46.966
number for Paris is 3,800

00:01:47.726 --> 00:01:51.576
. Cairo is massive, very densely populated,

00:01:51.992 --> 00:01:54.891
and with the population of Egypt growing

00:01:54.901 --> 00:01:58.981
at almost 2% a year, well, this situation

00:01:59.065 --> 00:02:01.305
isn’t going to change any time soon.

00:02:02.175 --> 00:02:05.085
Traffic clogs the streets for hours,

00:02:05.475 --> 00:02:07.635
air pollution chokes the lungs,

00:02:07.895 --> 00:02:10.419
and housing struggles to keep up

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:12.539
with a population that grows by

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:15.449
roughly two million every year.

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:20.399
And while Cairo might be sprawling

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:22.999
and densely populated, most

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:25.329
of the rest of Egypt…isn’t.

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:30.669
99% of the population of Egypt lives

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:34.269
in about 5.5% of the country’s area.

00:02:35.352 --> 00:02:37.541
There is a perfectly good reason for this,

00:02:37.721 --> 00:02:41.538
of course; most of Egypt is arid desert.

00:02:42.651 --> 00:02:45.221
It’s hard to build on, hostile

00:02:45.221 --> 00:02:48.241
to live in, and has no water.

00:02:49.501 --> 00:02:52.311
The lifeblood of the country is, as

00:02:52.311 --> 00:02:54.521
you will know, the river that runs

00:02:54.551 --> 00:02:57.511
almost vertically through it: The Nile.

00:02:58.861 --> 00:03:01.591
As a quick side note, we have a three-part

00:03:01.591 --> 00:03:04.295
mini-series all about the amazing story

00:03:04.305 --> 00:03:06.305
of the quest to find the origin of the

00:03:06.305 --> 00:03:11.345
Nile; that’s episodes 414 through to 416,

00:03:11.515 --> 00:03:13.105
if you haven’t listened to those already.

00:03:14.205 --> 00:03:17.635
Anyway, unsurprisingly, population centres

00:03:17.655 --> 00:03:21.025
in Egypt all cluster around the Nile.

00:03:21.925 --> 00:03:23.615
And Cairo is no exception.

00:03:24.025 --> 00:03:26.175
The Nile runs right through it.

00:03:26.675 --> 00:03:29.885
But there is a plan to separate

00:03:30.175 --> 00:03:32.715
Egyptian centres of population from

00:03:32.715 --> 00:03:34.705
the river that has been the lifeblood

00:03:34.735 --> 00:03:36.915
of the country for thousands of years.

00:03:37.835 --> 00:03:41.155
If you go 45 kilometres east

00:03:41.225 --> 00:03:43.375
of Cairo, right out towards the

00:03:43.375 --> 00:03:45.665
desert, on the way to the port

00:03:45.675 --> 00:03:48.185
city of Suez, you will find it.

00:03:49.505 --> 00:03:51.975
In fact, one sign in particular

00:03:52.285 --> 00:03:54.241
will not be difficult to spot.

00:03:55.395 --> 00:03:57.415
Shooting up into the sky,

00:03:57.725 --> 00:04:00.365
like a 21st-century gleaming

00:04:00.575 --> 00:04:03.445
obelisk, is The Iconic Tower.

00:04:04.685 --> 00:04:08.015
It’s 77 storeys high, making it

00:04:08.025 --> 00:04:10.181
the tallest building not just in

00:04:10.301 --> 00:04:13.311
Egypt but in the whole of Africa.

00:04:14.691 --> 00:04:17.711
It is the centrepiece of a city called

00:04:17.931 --> 00:04:20.965
“New Administrative Capital”, a project

00:04:20.965 --> 00:04:24.351
so ambitious it’s almost hard to fathom.

00:04:25.231 --> 00:04:28.321
60 billion dollars, an entire city

00:04:28.651 --> 00:04:31.348
built from scratch in the desert.

00:04:32.541 --> 00:04:34.831
The idea for the city was first

00:04:34.881 --> 00:04:39.081
unveiled in 2015 at a high-profile

00:04:39.121 --> 00:04:41.121
conference in Sharm el-Sheikh.

00:04:42.001 --> 00:04:42.591
Its name?

00:04:42.971 --> 00:04:44.421
Well, that's a good question.

00:04:44.941 --> 00:04:46.811
They hadn’t quite decided on the name

00:04:46.811 --> 00:04:49.641
yet, but as a placeholder, it would

00:04:49.641 --> 00:04:51.801
be called the New Administrative

00:04:51.801 --> 00:04:54.611
Capital, or NAC for short.

00:04:55.971 --> 00:04:58.941
The idea was to relocate the government,

00:04:59.481 --> 00:05:03.171
ease Cairo’s overcrowding, and project

00:05:03.201 --> 00:05:06.081
an image of modernity and control.

00:05:07.501 --> 00:05:10.291
Building started in 2016,

00:05:10.831 --> 00:05:12.505
first with official government

00:05:12.505 --> 00:05:15.145
buildings, offices, and some of

00:05:15.145 --> 00:05:17.435
the signature mosques and churches.

00:05:18.335 --> 00:05:20.725
There are, as of the time of writing

00:05:20.725 --> 00:05:23.538
this episode, almost 50,000 government

00:05:23.538 --> 00:05:25.488
workers who have moved into new

00:05:25.508 --> 00:05:27.918
offices there, although it’s not

00:05:27.948 --> 00:05:30.528
clear how many actually live there.

00:05:31.278 --> 00:05:33.408
According to most reports, most

00:05:33.418 --> 00:05:35.038
still live in Cairo proper,

00:05:35.378 --> 00:05:37.688
and commute out every day.

00:05:38.738 --> 00:05:40.938
But this is just the beginning.

00:05:41.468 --> 00:05:43.548
By the time the city is completed,

00:05:43.868 --> 00:05:46.598
it is slated to go over an area of

00:05:46.598 --> 00:05:50.441
950 square kilometres and have space

00:05:50.601 --> 00:05:53.621
for up to 8 million residents, almost

00:05:53.681 --> 00:05:56.021
half the current population of Cairo.

00:05:56.881 --> 00:05:58.891
If you look at the plans, of

00:05:58.891 --> 00:06:00.681
course, it looks pretty fantastic:

00:06:01.171 --> 00:06:03.591
an artificial river that meanders

00:06:03.601 --> 00:06:06.371
through the city, surrounded by a lush

00:06:06.391 --> 00:06:09.111
green park projected to be six times

00:06:09.111 --> 00:06:11.251
bigger than New York’s Central Park.

00:06:11.841 --> 00:06:14.851
Vast mosques, churches, clean

00:06:14.851 --> 00:06:17.411
streets, modern schools, a new

00:06:17.421 --> 00:06:19.681
airport, even a theme park.

00:06:20.851 --> 00:06:23.411
Boasts that it will set a new standard

00:06:23.611 --> 00:06:25.971
of what it means to be a “smart city”,

00:06:26.632 --> 00:06:29.711
or to quote its brochure, “Experience a

00:06:29.711 --> 00:06:32.701
city that seamlessly blends cutting-edge

00:06:32.751 --> 00:06:35.291
urban planning, smart designs, and

00:06:35.291 --> 00:06:37.571
advanced technologies to ensure the

00:06:37.571 --> 00:06:40.421
safety, efficiency, and vitality

00:06:40.598 --> 00:06:42.718
of both our cherished residents

00:06:42.918 --> 00:06:45.548
and esteemed visitors.” End quote.

00:06:46.808 --> 00:06:48.828
If it all sounds too good to be

00:06:48.828 --> 00:06:51.708
true, that’s because it is too good

00:06:51.708 --> 00:06:53.728
to be true, at least at the moment.

00:06:54.448 --> 00:06:56.258
There are posts on social media

00:06:56.558 --> 00:06:59.208
from curious tourists who popped in

00:06:59.208 --> 00:07:02.388
for a visit but found…nobody there.

00:07:03.258 --> 00:07:06.928
Huge wide boulevards, spotless streets,

00:07:07.278 --> 00:07:09.718
but no signs of life whatsoever.

00:07:11.235 --> 00:07:13.235
Egyptian authorities say that

00:07:13.245 --> 00:07:14.905
this is all to be expected.

00:07:14.995 --> 00:07:16.375
It’s part of the plan.

00:07:16.935 --> 00:07:19.665
Of course, millions of people aren’t going

00:07:19.695 --> 00:07:23.015
to flood in at once, but over time, the

00:07:23.015 --> 00:07:26.105
population will grow, to an estimated 6 or

00:07:26.325 --> 00:07:30.175
7 million by the year 2030, and there will

00:07:30.175 --> 00:07:33.535
be capacity for more, up to 8 if required.

00:07:34.805 --> 00:07:37.245
If this happens, it will relieve a

00:07:37.255 --> 00:07:39.575
huge amount of pressure from Cairo.

00:07:40.155 --> 00:07:42.755
The air quality will improve, people

00:07:42.915 --> 00:07:45.025
will live in better housing conditions,

00:07:45.305 --> 00:07:47.945
they’ll have access to better parks,

00:07:48.195 --> 00:07:50.725
schools, hospitals, you name it.

00:07:51.465 --> 00:07:53.325
It will be good for people who choose

00:07:53.325 --> 00:07:55.635
to stay in Cairo, and it will be

00:07:55.635 --> 00:07:57.865
good for those who decide to move.

00:07:58.255 --> 00:07:59.455
A win-win.

00:08:00.965 --> 00:08:03.225
But sceptics point out that

00:08:03.225 --> 00:08:04.905
the motivations for this city

00:08:05.225 --> 00:08:07.865
go beyond mere urban planning.

00:08:08.775 --> 00:08:11.405
Moving the capital 45 kilometres

00:08:11.415 --> 00:08:14.025
from Cairo isn’t just about space;

00:08:14.385 --> 00:08:16.885
it’s about security and control.

00:08:18.265 --> 00:08:21.225
As we talked about in the last episode,

00:08:21.565 --> 00:08:24.205
Cairo was the centre of the 2011

00:08:24.205 --> 00:08:27.595
revolution, and Tahrir Square an almost

00:08:27.645 --> 00:08:30.705
indestructible monument to civil unrest.

00:08:31.585 --> 00:08:33.945
By shifting the government to a

00:08:33.945 --> 00:08:36.365
remote desert site, the critics

00:08:36.365 --> 00:08:39.245
argue, Sisi is signaling that he

00:08:39.245 --> 00:08:42.205
wants to start afresh, away from

00:08:42.205 --> 00:08:44.185
the revolutionary energy of Cairo.

00:08:44.775 --> 00:08:47.675
It signals a reset, a chance

00:08:47.855 --> 00:08:49.635
to leave that chaos behind.

00:08:50.845 --> 00:08:54.415
When Sisi won re-election in 2018,

00:08:54.675 --> 00:08:56.955
he chose to take his constitutional

00:08:56.985 --> 00:08:59.215
oath outside the new parliament

00:08:59.425 --> 00:09:02.355
in the NAC, not in Cairo.

00:09:03.275 --> 00:09:06.855
He repeated this in 2024, swearing in

00:09:07.015 --> 00:09:10.005
for his third term under the desert sky.

00:09:10.885 --> 00:09:14.195
This is Egypt’s future, he seemed to say.

00:09:14.425 --> 00:09:18.005
Forget Tahrir; power lives here now.

00:09:19.135 --> 00:09:22.135
The city’s very design reinforces

00:09:22.145 --> 00:09:25.055
this idea, of power and authority.

00:09:25.935 --> 00:09:28.615
Wide boulevards and sprawling plazas

00:09:28.865 --> 00:09:31.735
dominate the layout, which a cynic

00:09:31.735 --> 00:09:33.585
might say have been deliberately

00:09:33.595 --> 00:09:35.955
planned to make it easier to put down

00:09:36.015 --> 00:09:37.955
any kind of public demonstration.

00:09:39.145 --> 00:09:41.725
Narrow streets, like those in Cairo

00:09:41.735 --> 00:09:43.655
where protesters once vanished

00:09:43.655 --> 00:09:45.725
into alleys or swelled out of

00:09:45.725 --> 00:09:47.895
sight, are nowhere to be found.

00:09:48.625 --> 00:09:50.185
Crowds would struggle to

00:09:50.185 --> 00:09:52.595
gather or hide in the NAC.

00:09:53.545 --> 00:09:54.895
That’s if they could get

00:09:54.895 --> 00:09:56.115
there in the first place.

00:09:57.075 --> 00:09:59.805
Unlike Cairo, where anyone could

00:09:59.805 --> 00:10:01.971
flood the streets, the NAC’s

00:10:01.971 --> 00:10:04.765
remoteness and planned zones make

00:10:04.765 --> 00:10:07.165
it easier to gate off any trouble.

00:10:07.955 --> 00:10:10.555
The army can just close the roads,

00:10:10.725 --> 00:10:12.985
effectively blocking off the city.

00:10:14.305 --> 00:10:16.805
And of course, any trouble is likely

00:10:16.805 --> 00:10:19.365
to be noticed and swiftly dealt with

00:10:19.595 --> 00:10:22.085
before it has the chance to bubble up.

00:10:22.595 --> 00:10:26.465
With 6,000 CCTV cameras spread throughout

00:10:26.475 --> 00:10:29.615
the NAC, every corner is watched, every

00:10:29.635 --> 00:10:32.415
step tracked, a stark warning that

00:10:32.425 --> 00:10:35.135
the state is watching your every move.

00:10:36.355 --> 00:10:38.415
Indeed, the entire project,

00:10:38.705 --> 00:10:40.465
or rather the company that is

00:10:40.675 --> 00:10:43.105
administering the project, is majority

00:10:43.125 --> 00:10:45.205
owned by the Egyptian military.

00:10:45.955 --> 00:10:48.205
This is a military city.

00:10:49.525 --> 00:10:51.715
But it is also President

00:10:51.725 --> 00:10:53.685
Sisi’s signature project.

00:10:54.355 --> 00:10:56.635
It’s a city to represent his

00:10:56.635 --> 00:10:59.058
vision of modern Egypt, and

00:10:59.068 --> 00:11:01.188
ensure his political survival.

00:11:02.468 --> 00:11:06.678
In 2015, when Sisi unveiled the plan, the

00:11:06.678 --> 00:11:09.588
country had endured years of upheaval.

00:11:09.961 --> 00:11:12.321
Thousands had been killed in clashes,

00:11:12.611 --> 00:11:15.581
tens of thousands more jailed, and the

00:11:15.581 --> 00:11:18.101
Muslim Brotherhood outlawed and hunted.

00:11:19.081 --> 00:11:21.521
Relocating to the desert, far

00:11:21.521 --> 00:11:24.481
from Tahrir’s symbolic pull, lets

00:11:24.501 --> 00:11:27.011
him redraw the map of control.

00:11:27.991 --> 00:11:31.551
The NAC isn’t just a new address; it’s a

00:11:31.551 --> 00:11:34.911
fortress, isolating power from the urban

00:11:34.911 --> 00:11:38.101
chaos that fuelled the 2011 protests.

00:11:39.071 --> 00:11:42.511
So, there is this criticism, that it is

00:11:42.521 --> 00:11:45.301
a cynical ploy to reduce the potential

00:11:45.321 --> 00:11:48.461
for future civil unrest and build a city

00:11:48.631 --> 00:11:50.721
that makes it a breeze to contain it.

00:11:51.945 --> 00:11:53.955
There is also the criticism that

00:11:53.965 --> 00:11:56.455
building cities in unnatural places

00:11:56.845 --> 00:12:00.295
never works, and this is a fool’s errand.

00:12:01.155 --> 00:12:03.355
There are countless examples throughout

00:12:03.355 --> 00:12:06.825
history of failed “new cities”, and

00:12:06.825 --> 00:12:09.575
indeed, this isn’t Egypt’s first stab

00:12:09.785 --> 00:12:11.915
at building a new city in the desert.

00:12:12.945 --> 00:12:15.925
Back in the 1970s, President Sadat

00:12:16.105 --> 00:12:18.885
had a similar idea, and it seems

00:12:18.885 --> 00:12:20.865
that he was not much more imaginative

00:12:21.085 --> 00:12:23.135
in his naming than Sisi is.

00:12:24.075 --> 00:12:26.035
He proudly announced Sadat

00:12:26.095 --> 00:12:28.775
City, which was to be about 90

00:12:28.775 --> 00:12:30.725
kilometres northwest of Cairo.

00:12:32.085 --> 00:12:35.905
Its aim, like that of the NAC, was to

00:12:35.915 --> 00:12:38.925
draw people away from the capital, but

00:12:39.305 --> 00:12:42.085
this was to work in factories and farms

00:12:42.305 --> 00:12:44.295
rather than to be a seat of government.

00:12:45.465 --> 00:12:47.415
It was meant to house half a

00:12:47.415 --> 00:12:50.615
million people; today, it’s home to

00:12:50.615 --> 00:12:53.705
fewer than 100,000, an industrial

00:12:53.725 --> 00:12:56.075
outpost that never really took off.

00:12:57.005 --> 00:13:00.015
Then there’s Toshka, a 1990s dream

00:13:00.175 --> 00:13:02.615
under Mubarak to divert the Nile

00:13:02.925 --> 00:13:05.165
and turn the southern desert into a

00:13:05.385 --> 00:13:08.585
“New Valley” with canals and crops.

00:13:10.195 --> 00:13:13.465
Billions were spent, but the water never

00:13:13.495 --> 00:13:17.004
flowed right, and now it’s a scattering of

00:13:17.034 --> 00:13:19.754
half-finished projects baking in the sun.

00:13:20.924 --> 00:13:22.694
These weren’t small plans either;

00:13:23.204 --> 00:13:26.304
Sadat City got 1.5 billion dollars

00:13:26.304 --> 00:13:28.174
in its day, and Toshka is believed

00:13:28.194 --> 00:13:29.734
to have swallowed even more.

00:13:30.714 --> 00:13:33.234
Both stumbled over funding, poor

00:13:33.234 --> 00:13:36.024
planning, and just a lack of people

00:13:36.184 --> 00:13:38.774
willing to leave the Nile’s cool embrace.

00:13:40.271 --> 00:13:42.691
Yes, the New Administrative Capital

00:13:42.851 --> 00:13:46.341
has glossier PR and more money behind

00:13:46.341 --> 00:13:49.011
it, but the ghosts of these earlier

00:13:49.011 --> 00:13:51.841
failures still linger; desert cities

00:13:52.081 --> 00:13:54.641
are easier to announce than to fill.

00:13:56.127 --> 00:13:58.427
And there is the other issue that

00:13:58.437 --> 00:14:00.417
building a city in the desert is

00:14:00.417 --> 00:14:02.667
a constant fight against nature.

00:14:04.047 --> 00:14:07.407
Outside the Nile Valley, Egypt gets

00:14:07.417 --> 00:14:10.247
less than 20 millilitres of rain a year,

00:14:10.797 --> 00:14:14.207
3% of the rainfall you get in London.

00:14:14.997 --> 00:14:17.567
Now, I know people always complain about

00:14:17.577 --> 00:14:20.517
the rain in the UK, but if you want a

00:14:20.517 --> 00:14:23.337
functioning city, some rain is good.

00:14:24.007 --> 00:14:25.257
At least you need more

00:14:25.257 --> 00:14:26.797
than 20 millilitres a year.

00:14:27.657 --> 00:14:29.957
And you certainly do if you have

00:14:29.977 --> 00:14:32.831
plans as ambitious as the NAC.

00:14:33.757 --> 00:14:36.897
The Green River and those lush parks

00:14:37.127 --> 00:14:40.037
need millions of litres every single day,

00:14:40.577 --> 00:14:43.447
piped in from the Nile or desalinated

00:14:43.457 --> 00:14:46.727
from the Red Sea, both costly options.

00:14:47.767 --> 00:14:50.817
In 2024, officials bragged about

00:14:50.827 --> 00:14:53.527
a new treatment plant to recycle

00:14:53.527 --> 00:14:56.117
wastewater, but it’s nowhere near

00:14:56.117 --> 00:14:58.487
enough for 6.5 million people.

00:14:59.557 --> 00:15:01.467
Then there’s the sand.

00:15:02.157 --> 00:15:04.527
Desert storms carry sand into the

00:15:04.527 --> 00:15:07.647
city every day, which not only gets

00:15:07.647 --> 00:15:09.527
in the way of construction during

00:15:09.527 --> 00:15:11.767
the building phase, but will be a

00:15:11.807 --> 00:15:13.787
constant feature of life in the city.

00:15:14.907 --> 00:15:17.007
Sure, other cities in the Middle

00:15:17.007 --> 00:15:19.267
East have similar issues, whether

00:15:19.267 --> 00:15:22.757
that’s Dubai or Riyadh, but these are

00:15:22.757 --> 00:15:25.137
also in countries with much deeper

00:15:25.137 --> 00:15:27.307
pockets than Egypt’s, much greater

00:15:27.307 --> 00:15:29.707
financial resources, thanks to oil.

00:15:30.567 --> 00:15:32.667
And, of course, we need to talk

00:15:32.677 --> 00:15:34.207
about the cost of all of this.

00:15:34.847 --> 00:15:37.807
As you might imagine, it is eye-watering.

00:15:39.207 --> 00:15:42.177
It’s officially pegged at 59 billion

00:15:42.177 --> 00:15:45.237
dollars, but some estimates suggest

00:15:45.247 --> 00:15:47.867
it could climb closer to 100 billion.

00:15:49.177 --> 00:15:52.227
The money for it comes from land sales,

00:15:52.607 --> 00:15:54.697
property development, and a large

00:15:54.697 --> 00:15:57.567
loan from China, but the Egyptian

00:15:57.567 --> 00:16:00.167
economy is not in a particularly strong

00:16:00.167 --> 00:16:02.587
place to be taking on so much debt.

00:16:03.497 --> 00:16:05.287
After increasing Houthi attacks

00:16:05.327 --> 00:16:07.967
in the Red Sea last year, revenue

00:16:07.977 --> 00:16:11.027
from the Suez Canal dropped by 60%.

00:16:11.617 --> 00:16:16.127
Inflation sits at 25.5%, and

00:16:16.144 --> 00:16:18.357
Egypt’s foreign debt has climbed

00:16:18.367 --> 00:16:21.197
to more than 165 billion dollars.

00:16:22.267 --> 00:16:24.787
And this is all in a country where

00:16:24.787 --> 00:16:27.807
30% of the population is below

00:16:27.837 --> 00:16:30.581
the poverty line, and 50% of the

00:16:30.737 --> 00:16:33.917
population makes less than $5 a day.

00:16:34.977 --> 00:16:38.267
So, to its critics, this all represents

00:16:38.307 --> 00:16:41.237
a massive financial commitment at a time

00:16:41.367 --> 00:16:43.567
when ordinary Egyptians are struggling.

00:16:44.697 --> 00:16:47.047
It is a luxury for the elite,

00:16:47.347 --> 00:16:49.407
disconnected from the needs of the

00:16:49.407 --> 00:16:52.297
poor who still crowd Cairo’s slums.

00:16:52.977 --> 00:16:54.747
While billions are being poured

00:16:54.777 --> 00:16:57.257
into wide boulevards and gleaming

00:16:57.427 --> 00:16:59.647
empty skyscrapers, Cairo’s

00:16:59.647 --> 00:17:01.817
infrastructure continues to crumble.

00:17:02.827 --> 00:17:05.837
This is Sisi’s Egypt, the critics say.

00:17:06.367 --> 00:17:08.817
A divided country: the planned,

00:17:09.197 --> 00:17:11.157
orderly city for the rich and

00:17:11.157 --> 00:17:14.287
powerful, and the chaotic, neglected

00:17:14.287 --> 00:17:16.187
metropolis for everyone else.

00:17:17.417 --> 00:17:20.027
So what are we to make of all of this?

00:17:20.707 --> 00:17:22.947
The New Administrative Capital is

00:17:22.977 --> 00:17:26.107
undeniably bold, a statement of

00:17:26.107 --> 00:17:29.027
intent etched in glass and steel.

00:17:29.827 --> 00:17:32.217
But its vast expense and

00:17:32.487 --> 00:17:35.197
strategic design raise questions.

00:17:36.147 --> 00:17:38.027
Is it a necessary step to

00:17:38.027 --> 00:17:40.657
relieve Cairo’s burden or a

00:17:40.657 --> 00:17:42.927
wasteful monument to Sisi’s ego?

00:17:44.337 --> 00:17:46.487
Perhaps it’s a bit of both.

00:17:47.187 --> 00:17:49.267
Cairo is bursting at the seams,

00:17:49.587 --> 00:17:52.367
but this doesn’t stop the NAC from

00:17:52.367 --> 00:17:54.437
being a calculated move by Sisi

00:17:54.887 --> 00:17:57.107
to ensure his political survival.

00:17:58.501 --> 00:18:01.307
And as for whether it ever really

00:18:01.307 --> 00:18:04.117
takes off, only time will tell if

00:18:04.117 --> 00:18:06.217
this desert city becomes Egypt’s

00:18:06.217 --> 00:18:09.207
future or joins the list of grand

00:18:09.237 --> 00:18:11.687
projects abandoned to the sands.

00:18:13.387 --> 00:18:16.297
OK then, that’s it for today’s episode on

00:18:16.307 --> 00:18:18.837
Egypt’s New Administrative Capital, part

00:18:18.837 --> 00:18:21.447
two of our mini-series on Modern Egypt.

00:18:21.907 --> 00:18:24.297
In part one, in case you missed it, we

00:18:24.297 --> 00:18:26.187
talked about the Egyptian Revolution.

00:18:26.527 --> 00:18:29.137
And next time, in part three, we’ll

00:18:29.177 --> 00:18:31.687
uncover an even darker side of Sisi’s

00:18:31.707 --> 00:18:34.917
regime with the murder of Giulio Regeni.

00:18:35.907 --> 00:18:37.807
You’ve been listening to English Learning

00:18:37.807 --> 00:18:40.457
for Curious Minds by Leonardo English.

00:18:40.767 --> 00:18:43.587
I’m Alastair Budge, you stay safe, and

00:18:43.587 --> 00:18:45.977
I’ll catch you in the next episode.
