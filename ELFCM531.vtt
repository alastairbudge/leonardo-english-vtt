Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:16.800
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.990
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.370
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is part two of our

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.530
three-part mini-series on the theme of “Putin and Poison”.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:37.709
In part one, we got an overview of the life of Vladimir Putin, his unlikely rise to power, and how

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:44.760
he has consolidated that power to be one of, if not the, most powerful men in the history of Russia.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:51.770
In parts two and three, this episode and the next episode, we are going to look in detail at two

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:58.069
incidents widely believed to have been approved, if not ordered personally, by the man himself.

00:00:58.529 --> 00:01:02.714
The first is the murder of his critic and former colleague, Alexander

00:01:02.714 --> 00:01:07.699
Litvinenko, and the second is the attempted and unsuccessful murder

00:01:07.849 --> 00:01:11.869
of a former Russian military intelligence officer, Sergey Skripal.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.629
They are both fascinating and terrifying incidents that give us an insight

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:21.110
into the mind of Vladimir Putin and the lengths that he is prepared to go to.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.329
So, let’s not waste a minute, and get right into it.

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:32.540
If you have ever travelled to Japan, or been to a place with exceptionally fresh fish,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.420
you will probably have tasted the difference between average and fantastic sushi.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:45.460
Sushi, when fresh that day and prepared properly, is on a completely different level.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:52.259
And bad sushi, well, it can leave more than an unsatisfactory taste in your mouth.

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.490
It can make you feel pretty unwell indeed.

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:02.250
And on the 1st of November, 2006, a man went for sushi

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:05.640
at a well-known sushi chain in London called itsu.

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:13.530
Later that day, he started to feel stomach pain, he started vomiting and had diarrhoea.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.280
As the hours passed, the pain worsened.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.670
He began sweating profusely and felt an overwhelming sense that something was very wrong.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.630
The pain didn’t let up, it didn’t die down, and in fact, it

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.480
got so bad that he asked his wife to call him an ambulance.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:39.047
He was whisked away to hospital and treated for suspected gastroenteritis.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:46.090
He spoke with a foreign accent, but he told the doctors his name was Edwin Carter.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.870
Mr Carter’s gastroenteritis showed no signs of getting better.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.600
In fact, it got worse, much worse.

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.760
It got so bad that he was transferred to a larger,

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.549
specialised hospital, University College London Hospital.

00:03:04.779 --> 00:03:07.209
Five days later, he was dead.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.270
The man’s name, as you might have guessed, was not really Edwin Carter.

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.309
It was Alexander Litvinenko.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.132
And this wasn’t gastroentiritis.

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.580
In fact, it had nothing to do with sushi at all.

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:31.329
He was poisoned by a radioactive substance called Polonium-210, a substance

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.560
that it is thought could only have come from a highly secure nuclear facility

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:41.520
in Russia and been administered to him, right slap bang in the centre of the

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.730
capital of the UK, on the orders of the Russian President, Vladimir Putin.

00:03:48.191 --> 00:03:54.981
On his deathbed, surrounded by his wife and doctors, as he knew he had but hours to

00:03:54.981 --> 00:04:01.120
live, he had a powerful message to the man he believed had ordered his assassination.

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:08.440
“…this may be the time to say one or two things to the person responsible for my present condition.

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:13.740
You may succeed in silencing me but that silence comes at a price.

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:20.570
You have shown yourself to be as barbaric and ruthless as your most hostile critics have claimed.

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:26.970
You have shown yourself to have no respect for life, liberty or any civilised value.

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.320
You have shown yourself to be unworthy of your office,

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.610
to be unworthy of the trust of civilised men and women.

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:41.240
You may succeed in silencing one man but the howl of protest from around the

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:46.880
world will reverberate, Mr Putin, in your ears for the rest of your life.

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.010
May God forgive you for what you have done, not only

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:56.620
to me but to beloved Russia and its people.” End quote.

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:04.040
To understand how it got to this point, we must go back in time, to the early 1990s.

00:05:05.607 --> 00:05:10.710
Alexander Litvinenko was, in fact, an indirect colleague of

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:15.532
Vladimir Putin at the KGB and then its successor, the FSB.

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:21.330
He had first been assigned to investigate a failed assassination attempt

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:26.380
on a man called Boris Berezovsky, who was one of Russia’s most powerful

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:31.400
oligarchs and had made a fortune importing cars, amongst other things.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.916
Berezovsky immediately liked Litvinenko.

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.730
He was honest, diligent, and hard-working.

00:05:40.432 --> 00:05:44.690
Berezovsky suggested that the young man go and meet Vladimir Putin.

00:05:45.489 --> 00:05:49.310
Berezovsky had helped Putin rise to power, and knew

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:52.360
that he was someone worth knowing in modern Russia.

00:05:53.450 --> 00:06:02.740
This was 1998, and Putin had just been made head of the FSB, the successor agency to the KGB.

00:06:03.798 --> 00:06:09.730
Litvinenko thought that Putin, as head of the FSB, would be interested in hearing

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:14.180
about the widespread corruption that Litvinenko had discovered at the bureau.

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:18.900
In particular, Litvinenko had been investigating the

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:23.350
FSB protecting Uzbek drug barons in exchange for money.

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:29.490
When Litvinenko first met Putin, he reported on these discoveries.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:35.580
Putin was utterly uninterested and closed down the investigation.

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:42.750
Later that year, in November 1998, Litvinenko and several colleagues at the

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:48.350
FSB held a press conference in which they claimed that they had received orders

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:54.230
to kill several prominent Russian businessmen, including Boris Berezovsky.

00:06:55.490 --> 00:07:00.100
Litvinenko was immediately sacked from his position at the FSB.

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:07.180
He was ordered not to leave Moscow, but he fled the country, fearing for his life.

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:13.040
He knew that when you got on the wrong side of Vladimir Putin, you didn’t

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:17.990
go to work quietly in a library or spend your days tending your garden.

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:22.290
It was, in all probability, a death sentence.

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:27.340
He first tried to claim political asylum in Turkey.

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:28.900
It was rejected.

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:37.890
He then bought a plane ticket back to Moscow, but importantly, the ticket involved a stop in London.

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:43.240
When he arrived at London Heathrow Airport, he claimed

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:46.890
political asylum, and this time it was granted.

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:54.250
He lived in exile in London, but he didn’t shy away from publicity, he didn’t

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:59.110
spend his days painting watercolours or teaching piano to schoolchildren.

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:03.460
He continued to publicly criticise Putin from what

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:06.970
he might have thought was a suitably safe distance.

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:14.210
And the intensity of his criticism only increased as time went by.

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:19.720
It wasn’t criticism only of the corruption that Putin allowed on his watch,

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:25.480
of which there was more than enough to complain about, but it became personal.

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:33.660
Litvinenko wrote an article on his blog alleging that Putin was a paedophile and that

00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:39.760
there was video footage of him having sex with young boys from his early days in the KGB.

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:47.890
Putin, Litvinenko alleged, had destroyed all of this evidence when he became head of the FSB.

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:57.970
This deeply inflammatory blog article was published in July of 2006, and Litvinenko chose to

00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:05.150
push it live after a video emerged of Putin kissing the stomach of a young boy in a crowd.

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:10.190
It is a real video, it’s on YouTube and is very unsettling.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:13.170
Putin is visiting a crowd.

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:18.320
There’s a young boy, who’s probably 5 or 6, and Putin

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:22.410
pulls up the boy’s shirt and kisses him on the stomach.

00:09:23.275 --> 00:09:29.940
Litvinenko took this as supporting evidence of his theory, and decided to publish this

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:36.490
article on a website called Chechenpress, which is the news agency of the Chechen separatists.

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:42.440
The allegation was unsubstantiated, there was no evidence for it.

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:46.380
And it didn’t make much of a dent abroad.

00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:51.130
But it was most definitely noticed by the Kremlin.

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:59.240
Shortly afterwards there was a new law passed that made defamation of the President a federal crime.

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:05.650
Now, before we continue, let’s just remind ourselves of exactly

00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:10.350
what’s going on in Russia and with Vladimir Putin during this period.

00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:19.150
In 1999, he was made Prime Minster, and a year later, in 2000, he became the president.

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:25.980
By the time this article was published, he had cracked down on the oligarchs, making it clear

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:32.810
that they could get rich in Russia but it was with his blessing, and playing by his rules.

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:39.370
He was also re-elected by a large majority in 2004.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.510
He was the undisputed modern tsar, and had taken steps

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:48.500
to silence anyone who had the tenacity to question him.

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:55.080
So, let’s move forward to November the 1st, 2006.

00:10:56.180 --> 00:11:01.440
For much of his time in London, Litvinenko had been pretty happy to meet with

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:08.350
journalists, other dissidents, and former colleagues without any formal private security.

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:13.260
He was an enemy of the Russian state, but on the streets

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:17.040
of London, he behaved just like any normal citizen.

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:24.338
And in the morning of the 1st of November, he met an Italian security consultant

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:30.344
called Mario Scaramella, at Itsu, a sushi restaurant in Piccadilly, in London.

00:11:31.454 --> 00:11:35.524
He ordered sushi and green tea, and then went on his way.

00:11:36.584 --> 00:11:42.534
Later that afternoon, at 4.30 to be precise, he went to the Millennium Hotel in

00:11:42.534 --> 00:11:49.034
London Mayfair, where he met two former associates: Andrey Lugovoy and Dmitry Kovtun.

00:11:50.004 --> 00:11:54.624
Both had ties to Russian intelligence, but they were keen to chat

00:11:54.634 --> 00:11:57.924
about potential business opportunities while they were in town.

00:11:58.677 --> 00:12:03.317
The reason for them being in London, by the way, was to watch the UEFA Cup match

00:12:03.427 --> 00:12:08.677
between Arsenal and CSKA Moscow, which was taking place later that evening.

00:12:10.167 --> 00:12:15.977
The match ended 0-0, and by all accounts was a pretty dull game.

00:12:17.497 --> 00:12:25.047
While this unexciting 0-0 draw was unfolding, Litvinenko was at home feeling awful.

00:12:25.597 --> 00:12:29.487
It was like no other sickness he had felt before, and he

00:12:29.507 --> 00:12:32.357
immediately said to his wife that he had been poisoned.

00:12:33.917 --> 00:12:37.277
At first, doctors couldn’t figure out what it was.

00:12:37.957 --> 00:12:43.327
Nothing seemed to be working, and his condition continued to worsen.

00:12:44.427 --> 00:12:49.427
He was transferred to University College London Hospital, but by this

00:12:49.427 --> 00:12:55.297
point he was deathly weak, and tufts of his hair had started to fall out.

00:12:56.577 --> 00:13:03.357
Now, if you have seen a picture of Alexander Litvinenko, the most recognisable one is probably

00:13:03.397 --> 00:13:10.287
of him in his hospital bed in a green smock, with all sorts of medical drips attached to him.

00:13:11.397 --> 00:13:15.347
And he is completely bald, there is no hair on his head.

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:23.736
Litvinenko was not a bald man, at least he wasn’t until the last few days of his life.

00:13:24.996 --> 00:13:32.076
Losing your hair, as well as your skin falling off, is a common symptom of radiation poisoning.

00:13:33.466 --> 00:13:37.416
But when the British doctors tested Litvinenko for signs

00:13:37.416 --> 00:13:40.706
of radiation, they found nothing out of the ordinary.

00:13:41.636 --> 00:13:45.566
It wasn’t until samples of his blood were sent to a specialist

00:13:45.596 --> 00:13:50.096
nuclear research facility that scientists noticed something unusual.

00:13:51.116 --> 00:13:56.076
There were extraordinarily high levels of a particular type of radiation

00:13:56.386 --> 00:14:01.739
that they knew could only come from a substance called Polonium-210.

00:14:02.752 --> 00:14:07.276
Now, this is not a poison you can buy in a shop or make by

00:14:07.306 --> 00:14:10.866
ordering the right compounds online and brewing up in your kitchen.

00:14:11.546 --> 00:14:15.616
It needs to be made in a nuclear reactor, and is one

00:14:15.616 --> 00:14:18.856
of the rarest and most expensive substances on Earth.

00:14:20.036 --> 00:14:22.426
It is also one of the most deadly.

00:14:23.716 --> 00:14:29.566
To give you an idea of how potent it is, just one microgram – a

00:14:29.566 --> 00:14:33.646
millionth of a gram – is enough to kill an adult human.

00:14:35.156 --> 00:14:39.746
The production of Polonium-210 is limited to highly secure nuclear

00:14:39.746 --> 00:14:46.159
facilities, and all signs pointed to one specific source: Russia.

00:14:47.679 --> 00:14:52.769
As Litvinenko lay dying in hospital, British investigators began

00:14:52.819 --> 00:14:56.809
piecing together how the Polonium-210 had been administered.

00:14:57.929 --> 00:15:03.319
It was, in all probability, slipped into Litvinenko’s green tea at the Millennium

00:15:03.319 --> 00:15:08.517
Hotel, where he met Lugovoy and Kovtun on the afternoon of November 1st.

00:15:09.231 --> 00:15:15.171
And sure enough, the teapot he used had extremely high levels of radiation.

00:15:16.251 --> 00:15:22.841
This was where the radioactive trail started, but further traces were found on the chairs

00:15:22.841 --> 00:15:28.251
the two likely assassins sat on, in their hotel rooms, and everywhere they had gone.

00:15:29.151 --> 00:15:34.651
Traces were even found on the plane they had flown into the UK on and on the

00:15:34.651 --> 00:15:39.121
plane they used to travel back to Russia, both commercial planes, by the way.

00:15:40.511 --> 00:15:44.261
Everywhere the Russians had gone, they left behind a poisonous

00:15:44.281 --> 00:15:47.831
trail, leaving little doubt about who was responsible.

00:15:49.501 --> 00:15:56.121
The sheer amount of Polonium-210 that investigators found suggested that it had not been handled

00:15:56.121 --> 00:16:02.481
very carefully—perhaps the operatives were sloppy, perhaps they didn’t know quite how dangerous the

00:16:02.481 --> 00:16:08.811
substance they were handling was, or perhaps they simply didn’t care about covering their tracks.

00:16:10.491 --> 00:16:16.481
Lugovoy and Kovtun denied any involvement, but the evidence was damning.

00:16:17.321 --> 00:16:22.281
Now, the Polonium-210 poisoning was no ordinary assassination attempt.

00:16:22.931 --> 00:16:28.211
The logistics involved in transporting such a deadly substance–on a commercial

00:16:28.231 --> 00:16:34.061
aeroplane no less–the willingness to deploy it in a foreign country and the utter

00:16:34.151 --> 00:16:39.861
disregard for potential collateral damage all pointed to state-level involvement.

00:16:41.451 --> 00:16:45.681
And while the Kremlin denied any involvement, Litvinenko

00:16:45.681 --> 00:16:48.271
himself had no doubt about who was responsible.

00:16:49.421 --> 00:16:55.081
On his deathbed, as you heard, he directly accused Vladimir Putin of ordering his

00:16:55.081 --> 00:17:01.001
assassination, a charge that Putin and the Russian government have, of course, always denied.

00:17:02.408 --> 00:17:05.548
In the UK, at least, few believe this.

00:17:06.398 --> 00:17:13.858
In 2016, after a long public inquiry, it was concluded by British authorities that Litvinenko’s

00:17:13.878 --> 00:17:21.922
murder was “probably approved” by President Putin and the then-FSB head Nikolai Patrushev.

00:17:23.062 --> 00:17:27.515
The inquiry stopped short of saying it was definitively proven

00:17:27.835 --> 00:17:31.755
but left little doubt about where the responsibility lay.

00:17:33.005 --> 00:17:38.199
So, why go to such extreme lengths to kill Alexander Litvinenko?

00:17:38.695 --> 00:17:42.965
Why use a rare radioactive substance, leaving behind a radioactive

00:17:42.965 --> 00:17:47.465
trail that, if discovered, pointed directly back to Russia?

00:17:48.525 --> 00:17:53.435
The answer perhaps lies in the nature of Vladimir Putin’s leadership.

00:17:54.275 --> 00:17:59.115
Litvinenko wasn’t just a critic of Putin; he had humiliated him.

00:18:00.105 --> 00:18:03.880
From accusing Putin of corruption to publicly calling him a

00:18:03.955 --> 00:18:08.705
paedophile, Litvinenko had crossed a line that few dared to.

00:18:09.765 --> 00:18:15.195
For Putin, this wasn’t just about silencing a critic; it was about sending a

00:18:15.195 --> 00:18:20.545
message—a message to anyone, at home or abroad, who dared to challenge him.

00:18:21.405 --> 00:18:28.015
Defiance would not be tolerated, and the consequences would be brutal and public.

00:18:29.295 --> 00:18:32.165
And, they would be slow and agonising.

00:18:32.905 --> 00:18:38.125
Radiation poisoning is a horrific way to die, and perhaps Putin thought

00:18:38.175 --> 00:18:43.445
that Litvinenko didn’t deserve the quick and more deniable death that a fall

00:18:43.665 --> 00:18:48.235
from a fifth-floor window or being strangled at home might have provided.

00:18:49.695 --> 00:18:55.284
As you might remember, or could certainly imagine, the murder of Alexander Litvinenko

00:18:55.575 --> 00:19:02.255
caused an international outcry and severely damaged relations between the UK and Russia.

00:19:03.415 --> 00:19:09.525
The UK expelled several Russian diplomats, imposed sanctions, and called for justice.

00:19:10.675 --> 00:19:14.782
But Russia refused to extradite Lugovoy and Kovtun,

00:19:15.085 --> 00:19:17.905
who remained in Russia under the Kremlin’s protection.

00:19:19.595 --> 00:19:23.885
Lugovoy, bizarrely enough, even went on to become a member

00:19:24.075 --> 00:19:28.105
of the Russian parliament, and he is still serving today.

00:19:29.545 --> 00:19:33.265
For Litvinenko’s family, the fight for justice continues.

00:19:33.885 --> 00:19:38.245
His wife, Marina, has become a vocal advocate, demanding

00:19:38.275 --> 00:19:42.575
accountability and shining a light on the Kremlin’s actions.

00:19:43.675 --> 00:19:49.785
But for the Russian government, Litvinenko’s death was a demonstration of its power—a

00:19:49.785 --> 00:19:55.173
chilling reminder that critics could be reached, no matter where they were in the world.

00:19:56.593 --> 00:20:00.833
The assassination of Alexander Litvinenko is one of the most brazen

00:20:01.093 --> 00:20:05.053
and horrifying examples of state-sponsored murder in recent history.

00:20:05.533 --> 00:20:08.243
It highlighted the lengths Vladimir Putin and his regime would

00:20:08.243 --> 00:20:11.903
go to silence dissent and protect their image of strength.

00:20:13.333 --> 00:20:19.583
And, unfortunately, it's just one of many, a pattern of poisonings, assassinations,

00:20:19.793 --> 00:20:24.333
and brutal tactics that have come to define modern Russia under Vladimir Putin.

00:20:25.508 --> 00:20:31.715
A few years after the death of Litvinenko, his former boss, the exiled oligarch

00:20:31.725 --> 00:20:36.255
Boris Berezovsky, was found dead in his mansion in the English countryside.

00:20:36.985 --> 00:20:40.705
It was ruled as suicide, but there have been multiple

00:20:40.705 --> 00:20:44.045
question marks over whether other factors were at play.

00:20:45.445 --> 00:20:51.305
And moving into the recent past, in 2018, there was another, perhaps

00:20:51.555 --> 00:20:56.295
even more audacious poisoning attempt—one that failed but was just as

00:20:56.295 --> 00:21:01.065
brazen: the attempted murder of Sergey Skripal in Salisbury, England.

00:21:01.985 --> 00:21:06.655
And that, my friends, is what we have to look forward to in the next episode.

00:21:08.335 --> 00:21:12.285
OK, that is it for today’s episode on Alexander Litvinenko.

00:21:12.795 --> 00:21:17.665
To state the obvious, this is a tragic and horrifying story, but it’s

00:21:17.675 --> 00:21:22.165
also a fascinating insight into the way that Vladimir Putin operates

00:21:22.435 --> 00:21:26.345
and the lengths to which he will go to maintain power and control.

00:21:27.309 --> 00:21:32.026
As a reminder, this is part two of our three-part mini-series on “Putin and

00:21:32.046 --> 00:21:36.124
Poison”, and in part three, we’ll look at the failed attempt to poison Sergey

00:21:36.124 --> 00:21:40.930
Skripal and what it reveals about the evolution of Russian tactics under Putin.

00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:46.070
