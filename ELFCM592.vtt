Hello, hello, hello, and welcome

00:00:08.225 --> 00:00:10.005
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:12.765
Minds, by Leonardo English, the show

00:00:12.775 --> 00:00:14.535
where you can listen to fascinating

00:00:14.535 --> 00:00:16.915
stories and learn weird and wonderful

00:00:16.925 --> 00:00:18.845
things about the world at the same

00:00:18.845 --> 00:00:20.555
time as improving your English.

00:00:20.905 --> 00:00:23.475
I'm Alastair Budge, and today

00:00:23.665 --> 00:00:25.595
we are going to be talking about

00:00:25.595 --> 00:00:27.625
something that millions of people

00:00:27.695 --> 00:00:30.125
have strong opinions about, yet

00:00:30.135 --> 00:00:32.755
surprisingly few could explain clearly.

00:00:33.255 --> 00:00:34.235
British politics.

00:00:34.785 --> 00:00:37.505
We’ll talk about how the British political

00:00:37.505 --> 00:00:40.255
system works, where it comes from, why

00:00:40.255 --> 00:00:42.975
it looks the way it does, and some of

00:00:42.975 --> 00:00:45.385
the quirky features that make it very

00:00:45.425 --> 00:00:48.155
different to politics in other countries.

00:00:48.355 --> 00:00:51.485
From how voting works to why this

00:00:51.495 --> 00:00:53.825
means British politics has historically

00:00:53.825 --> 00:00:56.135
been dominated by two parties, as

00:00:56.135 --> 00:00:57.785
well as where Scotland and Wales

00:00:57.825 --> 00:01:00.325
all fit in, I’m going to try to make

00:01:00.325 --> 00:01:02.465
it all make a little more sense.

00:01:02.885 --> 00:01:06.005
And perhaps oddly enough, in an episode

00:01:06.075 --> 00:01:08.445
about politics, I am going to make

00:01:08.445 --> 00:01:11.495
this as apolitical as possible, so

00:01:11.695 --> 00:01:14.225
this isn’t about saying one party is

00:01:14.225 --> 00:01:16.715
good and another is bad, but rather

00:01:16.715 --> 00:01:19.665
explaining how the entire system works.

00:01:20.188 --> 00:01:22.408
OK then, let's not waste a

00:01:22.468 --> 00:01:24.481
minute and get right into it.

00:01:26.308 --> 00:01:28.801
If you asked someone from outside

00:01:28.801 --> 00:01:31.718
the UK to describe British politics,

00:01:32.308 --> 00:01:33.668
you might hear something like this:

00:01:34.408 --> 00:01:37.648
“There’s a Prime Minister… and a King… and

00:01:37.668 --> 00:01:40.078
Lords…and something called Westminster…

00:01:40.498 --> 00:01:42.758
and people shouting at each other across

00:01:42.758 --> 00:01:44.698
an old room that looks far too small…

00:01:45.268 --> 00:01:47.828
and Scotland wants independence… and then

00:01:47.828 --> 00:01:50.038
there was Brexit…and there seems to be a

00:01:50.038 --> 00:01:52.308
new Prime Minister every five minutes.”

00:01:53.668 --> 00:01:55.918
And to be fair, that’s not an

00:01:55.918 --> 00:01:58.488
entirely inaccurate summary.

00:01:59.228 --> 00:02:01.998
British politics is unusual.

00:02:02.508 --> 00:02:05.578
It’s old, it’s full of quirky

00:02:05.628 --> 00:02:08.488
traditions, and it’s based far

00:02:08.488 --> 00:02:11.008
more on customs and conventions

00:02:11.258 --> 00:02:13.508
than on a single written rulebook.

00:02:14.098 --> 00:02:17.408
So over the next 20 minutes or so, I

00:02:17.408 --> 00:02:20.358
will try to explain how it works, so

00:02:20.558 --> 00:02:22.928
the next time you hear about an MP

00:02:22.928 --> 00:02:26.208
or the Commons or devolution, well,

00:02:26.498 --> 00:02:28.728
it might just be a little clearer.

00:02:29.798 --> 00:02:32.198
The first thing to talk about is a little

00:02:32.388 --> 00:02:36.008
history, as there are two key events

00:02:36.168 --> 00:02:38.688
that shaped the modern political system.

00:02:39.548 --> 00:02:43.538
The first was all the way back in 1215,

00:02:43.808 --> 00:02:47.638
when the then King John I was forced by

00:02:47.638 --> 00:02:51.128
a group of powerful English barons to

00:02:51.128 --> 00:02:54.698
sign a document called the Magna Carta.

00:02:55.278 --> 00:02:57.758
What this did was establish the

00:02:57.758 --> 00:03:01.208
principle that the king [or queen] was

00:03:01.208 --> 00:03:03.928
not above the law, that the monarch

00:03:04.128 --> 00:03:06.718
couldn’t just do whatever they wanted.

00:03:07.368 --> 00:03:09.228
I mean, they were still the most

00:03:09.238 --> 00:03:10.688
powerful person in the country,

00:03:10.988 --> 00:03:13.418
but it was the first time there

00:03:13.418 --> 00:03:15.938
were limits placed on this power.

00:03:17.258 --> 00:03:20.858
Fifty years later, in 1265, the

00:03:20.858 --> 00:03:23.438
first “semi-modern” parliament was

00:03:23.438 --> 00:03:26.548
called, when an English Earl called

00:03:26.558 --> 00:03:29.238
for representatives from counties, or

00:03:29.408 --> 00:03:32.288
districts, up and down the country, to

00:03:32.308 --> 00:03:34.708
come to the Palace of Westminster to

00:03:34.708 --> 00:03:36.988
discuss the management of the country.

00:03:38.108 --> 00:03:41.748
And this, more than 760 years ago,

00:03:42.208 --> 00:03:44.668
was the basis for the political

00:03:44.668 --> 00:03:47.078
system that still exists today.

00:03:48.324 --> 00:03:51.194
It has evolved significantly since

00:03:51.214 --> 00:03:53.544
then, with power shifting steadily

00:03:53.754 --> 00:03:56.144
from the monarch to Parliament, through

00:03:56.164 --> 00:03:58.884
civil wars, reforms, and revolutions.

00:03:59.174 --> 00:04:02.274
But today the country still has a

00:04:02.284 --> 00:04:04.214
monarch, there is still a parliament,

00:04:04.464 --> 00:04:06.304
which meets at Westminster, and

00:04:06.304 --> 00:04:08.244
is formed of representatives

00:04:08.374 --> 00:04:09.654
from up and down the country.

00:04:10.424 --> 00:04:12.674
So, let’s talk about Westminster,

00:04:12.834 --> 00:04:15.374
where it all began, and the tiny

00:04:15.414 --> 00:04:17.774
area of the country that is still,

00:04:17.952 --> 00:04:19.984
for better or for worse, the

00:04:19.994 --> 00:04:22.364
centre of British political power.

00:04:23.524 --> 00:04:25.644
If you have been to London, you

00:04:25.644 --> 00:04:27.564
will probably have seen the British

00:04:27.574 --> 00:04:30.034
Parliament; it’s in the Palace of

00:04:30.034 --> 00:04:32.444
Westminster, beside the River Thames.

00:04:32.774 --> 00:04:35.064
It’s the big building with Big

00:04:35.084 --> 00:04:38.004
Ben, the clock tower, at one end.

00:04:39.344 --> 00:04:42.084
Inside, parliament has two

00:04:42.084 --> 00:04:43.944
what's called chambers.

00:04:44.724 --> 00:04:47.754
The first is The House of Commons.

00:04:48.204 --> 00:04:51.184
And here “common” is short for

00:04:51.374 --> 00:04:53.744
commoner, just meaning a normal,

00:04:54.004 --> 00:04:56.788
non-titled or royal person.

00:04:57.678 --> 00:05:00.268
This is the heart of British

00:05:00.288 --> 00:05:04.068
politics, and where the 650 elected

00:05:04.088 --> 00:05:07.448
Members of Parliament, or MPs, sit.

00:05:08.498 --> 00:05:11.438
The other chamber is called the House

00:05:11.498 --> 00:05:15.158
of Lords, which has around 800 members.

00:05:16.148 --> 00:05:19.438
Importantly, these Lords are not

00:05:19.758 --> 00:05:21.658
elected by the public; they can

00:05:21.698 --> 00:05:24.191
only be appointed by the monarch–the

00:05:24.448 --> 00:05:27.058
king or queen–but they are typically

00:05:27.188 --> 00:05:29.328
proposed by the Prime Minister.

00:05:30.848 --> 00:05:33.348
Historically they were chosen because they

00:05:33.348 --> 00:05:36.281
were Lords, your father was a lord, so

00:05:36.411 --> 00:05:39.141
you would inherit his title after he died.

00:05:39.991 --> 00:05:42.601
This, clearly, was not a very

00:05:42.601 --> 00:05:45.411
democratic system, so it was reformed,

00:05:45.751 --> 00:05:47.461
and the number of what’s called

00:05:47.601 --> 00:05:50.361
hereditary peers was greatly reduced.

00:05:51.381 --> 00:05:55.251
Most members are now life peers, so

00:05:55.761 --> 00:05:57.821
people appointed for their expertise

00:05:57.841 --> 00:06:00.291
or their long public service, and

00:06:00.291 --> 00:06:03.481
importantly appointed for life; that’s

00:06:03.491 --> 00:06:05.681
why there isn’t a fixed number of them.

00:06:06.381 --> 00:06:09.111
They might be former politicians,

00:06:09.271 --> 00:06:12.134
scientists, lawyers, businesspeople,

00:06:12.171 --> 00:06:14.291
campaigners, or academics.

00:06:15.361 --> 00:06:18.841
Unlike hereditary peers, they cannot pass

00:06:18.841 --> 00:06:21.651
their title on to their children, and they

00:06:21.661 --> 00:06:24.671
usually serve until retirement or death.

00:06:25.571 --> 00:06:28.871
So although the House of Lords still

00:06:28.871 --> 00:06:32.001
sounds aristocratic, and it’s clearly

00:06:32.161 --> 00:06:34.031
less democratic than the Commons,

00:06:34.461 --> 00:06:36.861
the modern version is more like a

00:06:36.921 --> 00:06:39.291
chamber of appointed specialists.

00:06:40.151 --> 00:06:43.651
And the business of governing the country

00:06:43.991 --> 00:06:46.821
is split between these two houses: the

00:06:46.821 --> 00:06:49.871
House of Commons and the House of Lords.

00:06:50.821 --> 00:06:54.211
Typically the House of Commons will

00:06:54.251 --> 00:06:56.991
propose new laws, and it’s the House of

00:06:57.001 --> 00:07:00.511
Lords job to review and approve them.

00:07:01.171 --> 00:07:03.391
But crucially, it cannot block

00:07:03.571 --> 00:07:06.321
legislation indefinitely, forever.

00:07:07.141 --> 00:07:09.871
If the elected House of Commons

00:07:10.031 --> 00:07:13.621
insists, its decision ultimately wins.

00:07:15.071 --> 00:07:17.991
And then there is a third part of

00:07:17.991 --> 00:07:20.001
this political system, and that’s the

00:07:20.011 --> 00:07:23.011
monarch, the sitting king or queen.

00:07:24.471 --> 00:07:26.841
To an outsider, it might look like

00:07:26.851 --> 00:07:29.441
the monarch’s job is just to turn

00:07:29.481 --> 00:07:32.511
up in fancy clothes and a crown, and

00:07:32.691 --> 00:07:34.911
there is an element of truth to that.

00:07:35.621 --> 00:07:37.871
But the monarch still technically

00:07:37.891 --> 00:07:40.011
appoints the Prime Minister, opens

00:07:40.011 --> 00:07:41.971
Parliament, dissolves Parliament,

00:07:42.201 --> 00:07:44.171
meets the Prime Minister every week to

00:07:44.171 --> 00:07:46.301
discuss the state of the country, and

00:07:46.521 --> 00:07:49.361
gives the final say on any new laws.

00:07:50.161 --> 00:07:53.831
But, and this is an important but, the

00:07:53.831 --> 00:07:56.621
monarch will never go against Parliament.

00:07:57.191 --> 00:08:00.391
To do so would be suicidal for the

00:08:00.391 --> 00:08:02.801
monarchy, and it has been more than

00:08:02.891 --> 00:08:05.841
three centuries since a British monarch

00:08:05.981 --> 00:08:08.171
went against an act of parliament.

00:08:08.631 --> 00:08:12.061
So it is essentially ceremonial, although

00:08:12.101 --> 00:08:14.361
officially the monarch could say no.

00:08:15.711 --> 00:08:19.291
Supporters of this monarchical system

00:08:19.701 --> 00:08:21.731
argue that it provides stability,

00:08:22.081 --> 00:08:24.851
continuity, and a sense of national

00:08:24.881 --> 00:08:27.931
identity that’s above party politics.

00:08:28.811 --> 00:08:31.211
Critics say it's outdated and

00:08:31.441 --> 00:08:34.141
fundamentally undemocratic to have

00:08:34.141 --> 00:08:36.641
a king or queen that is in any way

00:08:36.761 --> 00:08:38.441
involved in the political system.

00:08:39.351 --> 00:08:41.481
Whatever your view, the practical

00:08:41.481 --> 00:08:44.111
reality is straightforward: The

00:08:44.111 --> 00:08:46.821
real political power in the UK lies

00:08:46.831 --> 00:08:48.811
with Parliament and the elected

00:08:48.821 --> 00:08:50.921
government, not with the crown.

00:08:51.331 --> 00:08:53.561
The monarch is the constitutional

00:08:53.821 --> 00:08:56.861
figurehead, the symbolic centre of the

00:08:56.861 --> 00:08:59.231
system, but not the one making decisions.

00:08:59.471 --> 00:09:01.621
They reign but not rule,

00:09:01.861 --> 00:09:03.011
so the expression goes.

00:09:03.811 --> 00:09:05.911
So, who does rule?

00:09:06.361 --> 00:09:07.941
Well, the government.

00:09:08.771 --> 00:09:10.721
And here, we must talk about how

00:09:10.721 --> 00:09:13.011
the British voting system works,

00:09:13.321 --> 00:09:15.871
how a party gains power, and how

00:09:15.871 --> 00:09:17.681
the Prime Minister is chosen.

00:09:19.311 --> 00:09:22.251
Unlike many democratic systems where

00:09:22.281 --> 00:09:25.461
citizens directly vote for the national

00:09:25.461 --> 00:09:30.001
leader, in the UK people do not vote for

00:09:30.001 --> 00:09:32.821
a Prime Minister, not directly at least.

00:09:34.051 --> 00:09:36.671
The British Prime Minister as of the time

00:09:36.701 --> 00:09:39.991
of recording this episode is Keir Starmer,

00:09:40.431 --> 00:09:44.471
and in the 2024 national elections, he

00:09:44.471 --> 00:09:50.601
received a grand total of 18,884 votes.

00:09:51.471 --> 00:09:52.551
You didn’t mishear that.

00:09:52.991 --> 00:09:55.858
18,884.

00:09:56.624 --> 00:09:58.121
Now, you might be wondering

00:09:58.811 --> 00:09:59.891
how that’s possible.

00:10:00.191 --> 00:10:03.031
A country of 70 million people, and

00:10:03.031 --> 00:10:05.521
the Prime Minister only received enough

00:10:05.621 --> 00:10:08.341
votes to fit a small football stadium.

00:10:09.101 --> 00:10:10.721
Well, the British voting

00:10:10.721 --> 00:10:11.931
system is different.

00:10:12.737 --> 00:10:16.847
The country is split into 650 areas,

00:10:17.017 --> 00:10:19.457
or constituencies as they are called.

00:10:20.267 --> 00:10:24.117
These are divided broadly by the number of

00:10:24.117 --> 00:10:27.757
people in each area, so Greater London has

00:10:27.757 --> 00:10:32.617
75, but the whole of Scotland only has 57.

00:10:33.787 --> 00:10:36.727
And at an election, British

00:10:36.797 --> 00:10:38.637
citizens registered in that

00:10:38.637 --> 00:10:40.907
constituency vote for candidates

00:10:41.237 --> 00:10:43.867
in that constituency, in that area.

00:10:44.837 --> 00:10:47.617
Typically each political party will

00:10:47.617 --> 00:10:51.147
propose one candidate per constituency,

00:10:51.697 --> 00:10:54.107
and the candidate who receives the

00:10:54.107 --> 00:10:57.187
most votes is elected the Member of

00:10:57.187 --> 00:10:59.337
Parliament for that constituency.

00:11:00.067 --> 00:11:02.707
So going back to Keir Starmer for a

00:11:02.707 --> 00:11:07.217
moment, he is the Labour MP for an area

00:11:07.217 --> 00:11:10.157
of London called Holborn and St Pancras.

00:11:10.977 --> 00:11:14.867
That constituency only has around 75,000

00:11:15.137 --> 00:11:17.937
registered voters, and he received

00:11:18.157 --> 00:11:21.527
just shy of 19,000 votes in the last

00:11:21.527 --> 00:11:23.757
election; he didn’t even receive a

00:11:23.757 --> 00:11:26.727
majority of votes in his own constituency.

00:11:27.987 --> 00:11:31.857
So, you have 650 constituencies, each

00:11:31.917 --> 00:11:35.077
of which votes for its MP, and most

00:11:35.127 --> 00:11:37.617
MPs are part of a political party.

00:11:38.347 --> 00:11:40.247
A party has a leader, and the

00:11:40.247 --> 00:11:42.287
leader of the party with the most

00:11:42.317 --> 00:11:44.447
MPs will become Prime Minister.

00:11:45.147 --> 00:11:49.047
So in practice, yes, Keir Starmer might

00:11:49.047 --> 00:11:51.627
have only got fewer than 19,000 votes

00:11:51.667 --> 00:11:55.687
directly, but everyone voting for a Labour

00:11:55.687 --> 00:11:59.957
MP in their constituency was indirectly

00:12:00.167 --> 00:12:01.877
voting for him as Prime Minister,

00:12:02.167 --> 00:12:04.177
because he was the Labour leader.

00:12:05.647 --> 00:12:07.787
The consequence of this system,

00:12:08.127 --> 00:12:10.737
the so-called “first past the post”

00:12:10.747 --> 00:12:13.927
system, is that it disproportionately

00:12:14.177 --> 00:12:16.137
rewards larger parties.

00:12:16.797 --> 00:12:20.527
For example, if, theoretically, one

00:12:20.597 --> 00:12:25.067
large party wins 51% of the votes in

00:12:25.177 --> 00:12:28.187
every constituency, and the remaining

00:12:28.377 --> 00:12:32.247
49% of the votes are split between

00:12:32.397 --> 00:12:35.347
two smaller parties, that large party

00:12:35.567 --> 00:12:39.717
would receive 100% of the MPs, and

00:12:39.717 --> 00:12:42.837
the smaller parties would receive 0%.

00:12:44.257 --> 00:12:46.417
And this advantage shows

00:12:46.417 --> 00:12:48.267
up in a few different ways.

00:12:49.137 --> 00:12:51.977
First, millions of votes can end

00:12:51.977 --> 00:12:53.887
up making no difference at all.

00:12:54.619 --> 00:12:57.407
A party whose support is spread thinly

00:12:57.637 --> 00:12:59.777
across the whole country might get

00:12:59.787 --> 00:13:02.197
a respectable share of the national

00:13:02.207 --> 00:13:04.867
vote but still fail to win a single

00:13:05.147 --> 00:13:07.867
parliamentary seat, simply because it

00:13:07.867 --> 00:13:10.257
never comes first in any constituency.

00:13:11.783 --> 00:13:14.683
Second, the opposite can also be true:

00:13:15.343 --> 00:13:17.993
a party with support concentrated

00:13:18.013 --> 00:13:20.693
in one region can win a large

00:13:20.693 --> 00:13:22.703
number of seats with a relatively

00:13:22.713 --> 00:13:25.283
small share of the national vote.

00:13:26.073 --> 00:13:28.873
This is why regional parties—like the

00:13:29.043 --> 00:13:31.923
Scottish National Party—often do well

00:13:32.263 --> 00:13:34.093
under the First Past the Post system.

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:38.540
Third, the system means that the national

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:41.320
vote share and the number of MPs a party

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:44.780
wins can look wildly out of proportion.

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:48.490
A party might win a comfortable majority

00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:51.390
in Parliament with well under half

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:53.500
of the popular vote, while another

00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:56.270
might win millions of votes and end up

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:58.900
with almost no representation at all.

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:01.380
This actually happened in

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:03.737
the last election, in 2024.

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:07.270
The Labour Party won what was called a

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:12.040
landslide victory, with 63% of the seats,

00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:16.290
but only won 34% of the popular vote.

00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:20.440
These are all variations of the same

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:24.150
point: First Past the Post rewards parties

00:14:24.327 --> 00:14:26.490
that can win lots of constituencies,

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:29.160
not necessarily lots of votes.

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:33.430
Supporters say this delivers clear

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:36.430
winners and stable governments; in

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:39.750
the UK coalitions are quite rare,

00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:43.014
with only 19 of the past 100 years

00:14:43.244 --> 00:14:44.944
having a coalition in government.

00:14:45.774 --> 00:14:48.614
Critics, on the other hand, say it’s

00:14:48.694 --> 00:14:52.044
unfair and distorts the democratic will.

00:14:52.664 --> 00:14:54.594
And this debate comes up

00:14:54.654 --> 00:14:56.514
at almost every election.

00:14:58.024 --> 00:15:00.504
Whatever your opinion, First Past

00:15:00.504 --> 00:15:02.544
the Post is one of the defining

00:15:02.544 --> 00:15:05.394
features of British politics, and it

00:15:05.394 --> 00:15:08.114
shapes almost everything about how

00:15:08.114 --> 00:15:10.384
politicians campaign, governments are

00:15:10.384 --> 00:15:13.164
formed and how power changes hands.

00:15:14.104 --> 00:15:17.234
So, there is a national election–or

00:15:17.434 --> 00:15:19.454
general election–which typically

00:15:19.454 --> 00:15:21.384
happens every five years.

00:15:22.064 --> 00:15:24.694
British citizens vote for their regional

00:15:24.724 --> 00:15:27.844
MP, the results come in, and typically

00:15:27.844 --> 00:15:30.794
one political party will win a majority,

00:15:31.044 --> 00:15:34.524
more than 325, of the electoral seats.

00:15:35.784 --> 00:15:38.154
Its leader will become Prime Minister,

00:15:38.434 --> 00:15:41.354
and he or she will appoint ministers

00:15:41.594 --> 00:15:43.164
to various positions of power.

00:15:44.224 --> 00:15:46.874
Of course, this is politics, so they’ll

00:15:46.884 --> 00:15:49.334
choose this strategically based on

00:15:49.384 --> 00:15:52.504
alliances, rewarding supporters, punishing

00:15:52.504 --> 00:15:55.144
critics, and perhaps putting rivals

00:15:55.284 --> 00:15:57.334
in token positions of responsibility

00:15:57.624 --> 00:15:59.484
from where they cannot mount an attack.

00:15:59.874 --> 00:16:01.824
But this certainly isn’t

00:16:01.864 --> 00:16:03.674
unique to British politics.

00:16:04.494 --> 00:16:07.174
Now, let’s talk about what

00:16:07.194 --> 00:16:09.504
these MPs actually do.

00:16:10.784 --> 00:16:12.994
Every MP, whether that is the

00:16:12.994 --> 00:16:15.514
Prime Minister, a government MP,

00:16:15.906 --> 00:16:18.974
or a member of a minor party, they

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:21.634
are the elected representative of

00:16:21.634 --> 00:16:23.994
the people in their constituency.

00:16:24.844 --> 00:16:27.774
This means that they have a duty to

00:16:27.774 --> 00:16:30.474
represent the interests and concerns

00:16:30.594 --> 00:16:31.664
of the people living in their

00:16:31.703 --> 00:16:34.014
area; they aren’t just representing

00:16:34.014 --> 00:16:35.754
their party or the country.

00:16:37.324 --> 00:16:39.984
How this works in practice is that

00:16:40.034 --> 00:16:42.704
anyone can write to their MP about

00:16:42.734 --> 00:16:45.134
a concern they have, whether that’s

00:16:45.144 --> 00:16:47.344
something as weighty as government

00:16:47.354 --> 00:16:49.594
foreign policy or simply that the

00:16:49.594 --> 00:16:51.714
local post office is closing down.

00:16:52.414 --> 00:16:55.484
And it’s the MP’s job to take these

00:16:55.484 --> 00:16:58.564
concerns to parliament, through some

00:16:58.564 --> 00:17:00.244
sort of filtering system, of course.

00:17:01.554 --> 00:17:04.724
And if you’ve seen clips of people

00:17:04.744 --> 00:17:07.824
standing up in an old-looking room with

00:17:07.834 --> 00:17:10.794
wooden benches with green fabric, shouting

00:17:10.794 --> 00:17:13.364
at each other, this is what’s happening.

00:17:14.794 --> 00:17:16.954
The highlight of this is every

00:17:16.954 --> 00:17:19.764
Wednesday, at 12pm: Prime

00:17:19.764 --> 00:17:22.874
Minister’s Questions, or PMQs.

00:17:23.634 --> 00:17:27.264
This is when MPs have the chance to

00:17:27.354 --> 00:17:29.404
ask the Prime Minister questions,

00:17:29.744 --> 00:17:31.454
questions that are typically

00:17:31.454 --> 00:17:33.524
intended to catch them out.

00:17:34.594 --> 00:17:36.394
It’s here that you have the most

00:17:36.404 --> 00:17:39.034
heated debate, and this is all

00:17:39.044 --> 00:17:41.714
broadcast live, for anyone to see.

00:17:42.694 --> 00:17:44.664
It’s a fundamental part of the

00:17:44.674 --> 00:17:47.144
British political system, requiring

00:17:47.144 --> 00:17:49.574
the Prime Minister to respond to

00:17:49.574 --> 00:17:52.164
unscripted questions about his

00:17:52.304 --> 00:17:53.794
or her government’s performance

00:17:54.194 --> 00:17:56.204
every week that Parliament is open.

00:17:57.064 --> 00:17:58.464
It certainly keeps the

00:17:58.464 --> 00:17:59.674
government on its toes.

00:18:00.484 --> 00:18:02.584
And this isn’t the only thing.

00:18:03.214 --> 00:18:05.714
The Prime Minister is only Prime Minister

00:18:06.054 --> 00:18:08.934
because he or she has the support of

00:18:08.934 --> 00:18:11.434
their party, the moment they lose that

00:18:11.434 --> 00:18:14.134
support is the moment they lose their job.

00:18:15.624 --> 00:18:18.314
This can happen in a couple of ways.

00:18:19.064 --> 00:18:20.704
Most commonly, it comes

00:18:20.704 --> 00:18:22.904
from inside their own party.

00:18:24.074 --> 00:18:27.274
Political parties in the UK can remove

00:18:27.324 --> 00:18:30.564
their leader if enough of their MPs

00:18:30.794 --> 00:18:32.424
decide they no longer support them.

00:18:33.594 --> 00:18:35.534
Different parties have different

00:18:35.804 --> 00:18:39.264
internal rules, but in practice it

00:18:39.264 --> 00:18:41.874
usually begins with a group of unhappy

00:18:41.874 --> 00:18:44.614
MPs writing to party authorities

00:18:44.874 --> 00:18:47.124
to demand a leadership contest.

00:18:48.144 --> 00:18:50.894
If the leader loses that contest, they

00:18:50.894 --> 00:18:53.734
step down as party leader, and because

00:18:53.734 --> 00:18:56.014
the Prime Minister must be the leader of

00:18:56.014 --> 00:18:58.454
the governing party, they automatically

00:18:58.604 --> 00:19:00.694
stop being Prime Minister as well.

00:19:01.664 --> 00:19:04.874
Alternatively, a Prime Minister can lose

00:19:04.884 --> 00:19:07.434
support in the House of Commons itself.

00:19:08.254 --> 00:19:11.054
The opposition can call what is known

00:19:11.084 --> 00:19:13.944
as a vote of no confidence, a formal

00:19:13.944 --> 00:19:16.424
test of whether the government still

00:19:16.434 --> 00:19:19.494
has the backing of a majority of MPs.

00:19:20.314 --> 00:19:22.964
If the government loses such a vote,

00:19:23.424 --> 00:19:25.844
convention says the Prime Minister must

00:19:25.874 --> 00:19:28.824
either resign or call a general election.

00:19:30.004 --> 00:19:32.444
Both of these mechanisms — internal

00:19:32.444 --> 00:19:34.914
revolts within the governing party, or

00:19:34.934 --> 00:19:37.694
formal votes in Parliament — mean that a

00:19:37.754 --> 00:19:40.414
Prime Minister is never entirely secure.

00:19:41.054 --> 00:19:43.124
They must constantly maintain the

00:19:43.144 --> 00:19:44.594
confidence of their colleagues

00:19:44.854 --> 00:19:46.614
and the support of the Commons.

00:19:47.624 --> 00:19:50.824
And it’s this reliance on maintaining

00:19:50.854 --> 00:19:53.254
confidence that makes British politics

00:19:53.444 --> 00:19:56.164
so lively, for want of a better word.

00:19:56.924 --> 00:19:58.954
Governments that appear strong

00:19:59.314 --> 00:20:02.024
can unravel quickly, and Prime

00:20:02.024 --> 00:20:04.404
Ministers can go from untouchable

00:20:04.614 --> 00:20:07.244
to unemployed in a matter of days.

00:20:07.974 --> 00:20:09.804
Or in the case of Liz Truss,

00:20:10.084 --> 00:20:11.634
who was Prime Minister back in

00:20:11.634 --> 00:20:15.604
2022, she lasted a mere 44 days.

00:20:16.484 --> 00:20:18.924
Now, let’s move on and talk

00:20:18.944 --> 00:20:21.004
about the main political parties.

00:20:21.884 --> 00:20:25.004
For much of the past 100 years,

00:20:25.584 --> 00:20:27.974
British politics has been dominated

00:20:28.024 --> 00:20:30.864
by two political parties: The Labour

00:20:30.864 --> 00:20:33.184
Party, which is currently in power,

00:20:33.594 --> 00:20:35.754
and the Conservative Party, which

00:20:35.814 --> 00:20:38.164
was in power for the last decade.

00:20:38.894 --> 00:20:41.354
No other party has had a majority

00:20:41.554 --> 00:20:43.614
since before the First World War.

00:20:44.874 --> 00:20:47.144
The Labour Party is traditionally

00:20:47.334 --> 00:20:50.054
centre-left, and is associated

00:20:50.054 --> 00:20:52.164
with workers’ rights, social

00:20:52.164 --> 00:20:54.324
equality, and public services.

00:20:55.084 --> 00:20:56.904
The Conservative party is

00:20:56.934 --> 00:20:59.634
centre-right, and is associated

00:20:59.634 --> 00:21:01.914
with free markets, limited

00:21:01.914 --> 00:21:04.144
government, and social conservatism.

00:21:05.444 --> 00:21:07.804
For much of the 20th century,

00:21:08.284 --> 00:21:11.054
British politics was a back-and-forth

00:21:11.074 --> 00:21:13.734
contest between these two giants.

00:21:14.094 --> 00:21:16.444
One would win an election and govern

00:21:16.444 --> 00:21:18.374
for a decade; then the other would

00:21:18.374 --> 00:21:20.444
return and reverse many of the

00:21:20.444 --> 00:21:23.334
policies, and depending on the mood

00:21:23.354 --> 00:21:26.254
at the time, both parties might shift

00:21:26.264 --> 00:21:28.764
slightly to the left or to the right.

00:21:29.734 --> 00:21:32.554
This created a political rhythm:

00:21:32.944 --> 00:21:34.684
Left, right, left, right.

00:21:34.974 --> 00:21:37.844
And this comes from the first past

00:21:37.844 --> 00:21:39.464
the post voting system that we

00:21:39.464 --> 00:21:40.884
talked about a few minutes ago.

00:21:41.824 --> 00:21:44.104
But it looks very possible

00:21:44.234 --> 00:21:46.044
that things might change.

00:21:47.014 --> 00:21:48.874
The most popular political party

00:21:49.154 --> 00:21:51.604
according to current polls is not

00:21:51.614 --> 00:21:54.604
Labour or Conservatives, or even the

00:21:54.604 --> 00:21:57.194
historically small-but-sometimes-important

00:21:57.384 --> 00:21:59.234
Liberal Democrats; it’s a

00:21:59.244 --> 00:22:02.224
relatively new party called Reform.

00:22:02.924 --> 00:22:05.654
Now, Reform was originally called the

00:22:05.664 --> 00:22:08.954
Brexit Party, a party which will, to

00:22:08.954 --> 00:22:11.394
quote its website directly, “stand up

00:22:11.394 --> 00:22:13.904
for British culture, identity and values.

00:22:14.204 --> 00:22:16.344
Freeze immigration and stop the boats.

00:22:16.684 --> 00:22:18.084
Restore law and order.

00:22:18.384 --> 00:22:20.594
Repair our broken public services.

00:22:20.914 --> 00:22:22.974
Cut taxes to make work pay.

00:22:23.314 --> 00:22:24.504
End government waste.

00:22:24.864 --> 00:22:26.224
Slash energy bills.

00:22:26.534 --> 00:22:28.604
Unlock real economic growth.”

00:22:30.044 --> 00:22:33.124
Its critics paint it as a far-right

00:22:33.234 --> 00:22:35.944
populist party, but its supporters

00:22:36.194 --> 00:22:38.894
say it is the only party capable of

00:22:38.894 --> 00:22:40.814
fixing a broken political system.

00:22:41.914 --> 00:22:44.044
It certainly is increasingly popular,

00:22:44.504 --> 00:22:47.194
and the most recent opinion poll has

00:22:47.194 --> 00:22:50.884
it far ahead, with 27% vote share, to

00:22:50.884 --> 00:22:54.857
Labour’s 19% and The Conservatives 18%.

00:22:55.714 --> 00:22:57.784
The next general election is not

00:22:57.804 --> 00:23:01.254
scheduled to be held until 2029, so

00:23:01.424 --> 00:23:03.554
there is a long time for those numbers

00:23:03.554 --> 00:23:06.114
to move, and they most likely will have

00:23:06.114 --> 00:23:08.294
shifted by the time you listen to this.

00:23:08.754 --> 00:23:11.564
But if it continues this way, it may

00:23:11.574 --> 00:23:14.144
just be the first time in a century

00:23:14.354 --> 00:23:16.674
that the UK will not have a Labour

00:23:16.854 --> 00:23:18.424
or Conservative Prime Minister.

00:23:19.354 --> 00:23:21.984
Now, there is one final thing to mention,

00:23:22.394 --> 00:23:25.354
and that is an additional complication to

00:23:25.354 --> 00:23:28.124
do with the unusual structure of the UK.

00:23:29.144 --> 00:23:31.744
And this is something called devolution.

00:23:32.664 --> 00:23:35.034
The United Kingdom is formed of

00:23:35.054 --> 00:23:37.644
four countries: England, Wales,

00:23:37.824 --> 00:23:39.794
Scotland and Northern Ireland.

00:23:40.674 --> 00:23:42.964
In response to growing calls for

00:23:43.224 --> 00:23:45.454
greater autonomy, especially in

00:23:45.454 --> 00:23:47.514
Scotland, starting in the late

00:23:47.544 --> 00:23:51.334
1990s the UK started to transfer

00:23:51.574 --> 00:23:53.714
certain powers away from the central

00:23:53.724 --> 00:23:56.094
government to regional parliaments.

00:23:57.084 --> 00:23:58.544
This means that there are

00:23:58.544 --> 00:24:00.594
regional parliaments in Scotland,

00:24:00.854 --> 00:24:02.834
Wales and Northern Ireland.

00:24:03.934 --> 00:24:06.904
Each of these have slightly different

00:24:06.904 --> 00:24:09.624
powers to change laws, but they

00:24:09.624 --> 00:24:12.404
typically can pass laws on issues

00:24:12.674 --> 00:24:14.624
that affect that region, such as

00:24:14.624 --> 00:24:17.024
on education and health systems.

00:24:18.304 --> 00:24:20.784
Interestingly enough, England, which

00:24:20.804 --> 00:24:23.654
is by far the largest part of the UK,

00:24:24.114 --> 00:24:26.724
has no devolved parliament of its own.

00:24:27.154 --> 00:24:29.604
Its laws are made by Westminster.

00:24:30.704 --> 00:24:32.954
This creates a tension called

00:24:32.984 --> 00:24:34.864
the “West Lothian Question”.

00:24:35.614 --> 00:24:38.354
Scottish MPs can vote on laws

00:24:38.484 --> 00:24:40.574
that only affect England, such

00:24:40.574 --> 00:24:42.864
as English schools or hospitals.

00:24:43.114 --> 00:24:46.794
But English MPs cannot vote on similar

00:24:46.794 --> 00:24:49.264
laws for Scotland, because Scotland

00:24:49.434 --> 00:24:51.234
controls those matters itself.

00:24:51.954 --> 00:24:54.284
It's a small but important question.

00:24:55.204 --> 00:24:57.944
So, to wrap things up, the British

00:24:57.964 --> 00:25:00.154
political system is not perfect.

00:25:00.394 --> 00:25:02.664
It's a patchwork of rituals,

00:25:02.894 --> 00:25:04.454
culture, and history.

00:25:04.974 --> 00:25:08.297
But at its core there are some important

00:25:08.314 --> 00:25:11.371
principles: nobody is above the law,

00:25:11.824 --> 00:25:14.434
Members of Parliament exist to serve

00:25:14.434 --> 00:25:16.904
the people, and there are checks and

00:25:16.924 --> 00:25:19.654
balances to ensure that anyone not

00:25:19.694 --> 00:25:22.564
doing a good job is swiftly sacked.

00:25:23.284 --> 00:25:26.634
It is imperfect, but to quote the

00:25:26.674 --> 00:25:29.534
two-time British Prime Minister, Winston

00:25:29.534 --> 00:25:32.054
Churchill, “Many forms of Government

00:25:32.214 --> 00:25:34.204
have been tried, and will be tried

00:25:34.454 --> 00:25:37.584
in this world of sin and woe. No one

00:25:37.584 --> 00:25:40.374
pretends that democracy is perfect or

00:25:40.374 --> 00:25:43.524
all-wise. Indeed it has been said that

00:25:43.524 --> 00:25:46.364
democracy is the worst form of Government

00:25:46.784 --> 00:25:49.464
except for all those other forms that

00:25:49.474 --> 00:25:51.634
have been tried from time to time.”

00:25:53.334 --> 00:25:56.054
OK, then, that is it for today's episode

00:25:56.294 --> 00:25:58.814
on the weird and wacky, and sometimes

00:25:58.814 --> 00:26:01.054
wonderful, world of British politics.

00:26:01.274 --> 00:26:02.584
I hope it's been an interesting one

00:26:02.814 --> 00:26:04.414
and that you've learnt something new.

00:26:04.994 --> 00:26:06.544
As always, I would love to know

00:26:06.544 --> 00:26:08.064
what you thought of this episode.

00:26:08.544 --> 00:26:09.934
What was surprising to you

00:26:10.194 --> 00:26:11.394
about British politics?

00:26:11.554 --> 00:26:13.744
If you live in the UK, what do you

00:26:13.744 --> 00:26:15.934
think will happen in the next election?

00:26:16.364 --> 00:26:18.484
And how does the political system in

00:26:18.484 --> 00:26:21.474
the UK differ from that in your country?

00:26:21.754 --> 00:26:23.514
I would love to know, so let’s

00:26:23.514 --> 00:26:24.854
get this discussion started.

00:26:25.114 --> 00:26:26.704
