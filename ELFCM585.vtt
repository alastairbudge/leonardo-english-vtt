Hello, hello, hello, and welcome

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:09.790
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.720
Minds, by Leonardo English, the show

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.649
where you can listen to fascinating

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.170
stories and learn weird and wonderful

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:19.289
things about the world at the same

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.160
time as improving your English.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.980
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.430
going to be talking about Artificial

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.720
Intelligence and the environment.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.209
It has been billed as a disaster in

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.540
plain sight, technology pointlessly

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.279
destroying the planet, but is there

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.493
actually any substance behind it?

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.160
Why are some environmental activists

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.010
highly critical of things like ChatGPT?

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.319
Are they right to be critical, and

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:52.319
what does this all mean for you?

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.639
OK then, let's not waste a

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.941
minute and get right into it.

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.370
There was a report from BBC Scotland a few

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.160
weeks ago with the title “Scottish data

00:01:07.169 --> 00:01:11.500
centres powering AI already using enough

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.500
water to fill 27 million bottles a year”.

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.650
The headline was deliberately provocative.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.219
27 million bottles sounds like…a lot.

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.190
And if AI is responsible for using all

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.380
of this, does this mean 27 fewer bottles

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.650
of water for the good people of Scotland?

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.410
For the story, the reporter had taken

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.520
to the streets to ask people whether

00:01:44.769 --> 00:01:47.839
they used tools like ChatGPT, and

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.259
whether they knew “it could be bad

00:01:50.269 --> 00:01:52.660
for the environment”, using that

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:55.310
exact phrasing of the sentence.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.590
A loaded question, as we say in English.

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:01.490
Of course, most said they were

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.669
not, and agreed that people

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.443
should be more aware of it.

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:09.099
And the general reaction is probably

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.750
best summed up by the end of the

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.920
clip, where an elderly gentleman

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.420
commented, “one day you’re waking up

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.160
and you cannae have a shower because

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.969
there’s no water because it’s cooling

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.660
down some computer somewhere”.

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:25.199
So, is this actually true?

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:27.859
Are the good people of Scotland in

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.260
danger of having to go without a

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.880
shower because the water has all been

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.359
used for your and my ChatGPT queries?

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:41.079
In a word, no, especially not in Scotland.

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:45.210
As one user on Facebook humorously

00:02:45.249 --> 00:02:47.609
put it, “I live in Scotland.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.329
I often think “if only we had more

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:53.840
water, I mean if just for once it

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.829
could fall out of the sky or something.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.260
I’m burning up here””.

00:02:58.711 --> 00:03:02.061
To be fair, if you clicked into the BBC

00:03:02.101 --> 00:03:04.231
article and didn’t just watch the video,

00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:08.501
the article did admit that water use for

00:03:08.511 --> 00:03:11.571
data centres had increased significantly,

00:03:11.741 --> 00:03:15.101
but was still only responsible for

00:03:15.111 --> 00:03:19.871
0.005% of the water supply in Scotland.

00:03:21.041 --> 00:03:24.291
And anyone who lives in Scotland or who

00:03:24.291 --> 00:03:27.231
has visited Scotland will probably be

00:03:27.231 --> 00:03:29.611
able to tell you, without reaching for

00:03:29.621 --> 00:03:32.601
any official dataset or doing complicated

00:03:32.621 --> 00:03:35.361
calculations on Excel, that Scotland

00:03:36.081 --> 00:03:39.051
has many problems, but water does not

00:03:39.051 --> 00:03:42.021
seem to be one of them; if Scotland

00:03:42.231 --> 00:03:44.601
were an independent country, it would

00:03:44.601 --> 00:03:47.681
be the second wettest country in Europe.

00:03:48.401 --> 00:03:50.881
So, as far as Scotland is concerned,

00:03:51.121 --> 00:03:53.961
they could build 100 times as many data

00:03:53.961 --> 00:03:59.241
centres, and it would still only use 0.5%

00:03:59.251 --> 00:04:02.391
of the Scottish water supply, and that’s

00:04:02.391 --> 00:04:04.551
assuming there are no improvements in

00:04:04.551 --> 00:04:07.391
efficiency in how this water is used.

00:04:08.401 --> 00:04:11.511
Now, before we get into some of the

00:04:11.521 --> 00:04:14.711
details of the other environmental

00:04:14.711 --> 00:04:18.071
concerns around AI, it’s first worth

00:04:18.071 --> 00:04:20.671
spending a few minutes clarifying

00:04:21.081 --> 00:04:22.441
exactly what we’re talking about,

00:04:22.891 --> 00:04:27.041
how AI uses energy, and why this is

00:04:27.141 --> 00:04:29.801
different from previous technologies.

00:04:31.051 --> 00:04:33.451
For starters, using any kind

00:04:33.451 --> 00:04:35.721
of technology uses energy.

00:04:35.991 --> 00:04:38.491
When you send an email, search for

00:04:38.491 --> 00:04:40.261
something on Google, listen to this

00:04:40.261 --> 00:04:43.401
podcast, or do almost anything that

00:04:43.401 --> 00:04:46.721
connects to the Internet, information

00:04:47.001 --> 00:04:48.971
is being transferred between

00:04:48.971 --> 00:04:51.331
your computer and somewhere else.

00:04:52.071 --> 00:04:55.701
That “somewhere else” isn’t a mysterious

00:04:55.811 --> 00:04:57.861
cloud floating above your head.

00:04:58.631 --> 00:05:01.061
In most cases, it's a physical

00:05:01.091 --> 00:05:03.701
location called a data centre.

00:05:04.671 --> 00:05:07.641
A data centre is, essentially, a

00:05:07.661 --> 00:05:10.481
giant warehouse full of computers,

00:05:10.701 --> 00:05:13.271
tens of thousands of them, all

00:05:13.301 --> 00:05:16.291
stacked up in metal racks, blinking

00:05:16.291 --> 00:05:19.411
away, processing and storing data.

00:05:20.211 --> 00:05:22.071
They don’t look very exciting,

00:05:22.131 --> 00:05:24.311
but they are the backbone

00:05:24.541 --> 00:05:26.271
of the modern digital world.

00:05:26.811 --> 00:05:29.831
Every photo you upload, every YouTube

00:05:29.841 --> 00:05:32.341
video you watch, every Spotify

00:05:32.341 --> 00:05:35.111
song you play, this is all being

00:05:35.111 --> 00:05:38.331
sent to and from one of these data

00:05:38.331 --> 00:05:40.541
centres somewhere in the world.

00:05:41.381 --> 00:05:43.231
And all of this takes energy.

00:05:43.901 --> 00:05:46.041
Your computer or mobile phone

00:05:46.271 --> 00:05:48.261
needs energy to make the request,

00:05:48.641 --> 00:05:50.291
so you charge it up at home.

00:05:50.871 --> 00:05:52.921
And the computers in the data

00:05:52.921 --> 00:05:55.061
centre, of course, also need

00:05:55.081 --> 00:05:57.101
energy; they need electricity.

00:05:57.991 --> 00:06:01.091
But, like any computer, they can also

00:06:01.091 --> 00:06:03.701
get very hot, which means they need

00:06:03.711 --> 00:06:06.891
to be cooled; sometimes this is by

00:06:06.911 --> 00:06:08.831
enormous air-conditioning systems,

00:06:09.401 --> 00:06:11.681
or in some cases, by water that

00:06:11.681 --> 00:06:14.071
flows through pipes to remove heat.

00:06:14.771 --> 00:06:17.601
So, whether it’s these air-conditioning

00:06:17.601 --> 00:06:21.721
systems or cold water, these data centres

00:06:22.011 --> 00:06:24.431
require large amounts of electricity

00:06:24.731 --> 00:06:26.961
to keep everything running, and more

00:06:26.961 --> 00:06:29.361
importantly, to keep everything cool.

00:06:30.891 --> 00:06:33.521
So, even before we get to the question

00:06:33.531 --> 00:06:36.431
of AI, every time you open a web

00:06:36.451 --> 00:06:39.051
page, watch a YouTube video, and yes,

00:06:39.171 --> 00:06:41.381
even listen to a podcast, a little

00:06:41.391 --> 00:06:43.951
bit of energy is being used somewhere

00:06:44.061 --> 00:06:45.501
in the world to make that happen.

00:06:46.261 --> 00:06:48.811
Now, with Artificial Intelligence,

00:06:49.021 --> 00:06:50.681
things are a bit different.

00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:54.391
When you ask ChatGPT a question, or

00:06:54.591 --> 00:06:57.251
generate an image, or use an AI assistant

00:06:57.281 --> 00:07:00.461
on your phone, it isn’t just retrieving

00:07:00.701 --> 00:07:02.571
some information from somewhere.

00:07:02.911 --> 00:07:05.651
It's computing it, creating

00:07:05.651 --> 00:07:08.091
something new in real time.

00:07:09.131 --> 00:07:11.701
This means much more powerful

00:07:11.701 --> 00:07:14.171
computers are involved, the kind

00:07:14.391 --> 00:07:15.751
that can do billions or even

00:07:15.801 --> 00:07:18.271
trillions of calculations per second.

00:07:19.131 --> 00:07:22.111
These chips, or Graphics Processing

00:07:22.121 --> 00:07:24.951
Units, GPUs for short, they use

00:07:24.951 --> 00:07:27.591
far more energy than the servers

00:07:27.611 --> 00:07:29.571
that store your emails or photos.

00:07:30.371 --> 00:07:33.541
And because AI systems are so large,

00:07:33.641 --> 00:07:36.811
with billions of parameters or virtual

00:07:36.811 --> 00:07:38.671
“connections” between artificial

00:07:38.671 --> 00:07:41.881
neurons, they need vast amounts of energy

00:07:42.271 --> 00:07:45.301
both to train them and to run them.

00:07:46.921 --> 00:07:50.101
So while a Google search might use

00:07:50.101 --> 00:07:52.831
enough energy to power a light bulb

00:07:52.831 --> 00:07:55.621
for a few seconds, generating a single

00:07:55.895 --> 00:07:59.261
AI image or a long ChatGPT reply,

00:07:59.801 --> 00:08:01.921
early critics pointed out, might use

00:08:02.241 --> 00:08:05.841
ten, twenty, or even fifty times more.

00:08:06.741 --> 00:08:09.611
That is why environmental campaigners

00:08:09.951 --> 00:08:12.031
have started to pay attention, because

00:08:12.071 --> 00:08:14.891
AI use is exploding at breakneck speed,

00:08:15.151 --> 00:08:18.591
and AI is much more energy-intensive

00:08:18.801 --> 00:08:20.981
than almost every other consumer

00:08:20.981 --> 00:08:24.351
technology; each request requires far more

00:08:24.351 --> 00:08:27.341
computing power, therefore more energy.

00:08:28.345 --> 00:08:30.271
But, you are probably wondering,

00:08:30.851 --> 00:08:32.711
how much energy is this?

00:08:33.211 --> 00:08:35.731
Well, when ChatGPT was first

00:08:35.731 --> 00:08:37.681
released, there were all sorts of

00:08:37.681 --> 00:08:40.731
articles suggesting that it was 22

00:08:40.731 --> 00:08:42.981
times more energy-intensive than

00:08:42.981 --> 00:08:45.131
using Google and that it was a

00:08:45.161 --> 00:08:47.851
giant menace to the environment.

00:08:49.061 --> 00:08:52.721
22 times more emissions sounds bad,

00:08:53.431 --> 00:08:56.541
but firstly, that number has proved

00:08:56.841 --> 00:08:59.491
not to be correct, and secondly, it’s

00:08:59.491 --> 00:09:01.931
important to see it in perspective.

00:09:02.821 --> 00:09:05.575
On the first point, according to

00:09:05.575 --> 00:09:08.715
a recent study, a single Google

00:09:08.745 --> 00:09:12.705
Gemini text query, so a single use

00:09:12.705 --> 00:09:18.415
of Google’s AI, uses 0.24 Wh of

00:09:18.415 --> 00:09:24.208
electricity, emits 0.03 grams of CO2,

00:09:24.615 --> 00:09:29.275
and consumes 0.26 millilitres of water.

00:09:30.975 --> 00:09:33.395
Now, to put that in perspective,

00:09:33.975 --> 00:09:36.745
the energy use is like one

00:09:36.775 --> 00:09:40.195
second of using a microwave, or 6

00:09:40.205 --> 00:09:42.295
seconds of having your fridge on.

00:09:43.225 --> 00:09:47.145
0.03 grams of CO2 is practically

00:09:47.155 --> 00:09:50.181
nothing, and 0.26 millilitres

00:09:50.425 --> 00:09:52.855
is five drops of water.

00:09:53.955 --> 00:09:57.885
Now, some AI uses are more intensive,

00:09:58.005 --> 00:10:00.275
like generating an image or video,

00:10:00.545 --> 00:10:02.905
and not all AI models are the same;

00:10:03.515 --> 00:10:05.945
OpenAI, which is the company behind

00:10:06.005 --> 00:10:09.035
ChatGPT, hasn’t released a similar

00:10:09.035 --> 00:10:11.885
study, and it’s believed it’s not

00:10:11.935 --> 00:10:14.495
yet as energy efficient as Google.

00:10:15.375 --> 00:10:18.235
I’ll use them semi-interchangeably here.

00:10:18.725 --> 00:10:21.455
If ChatGPT isn’t yet as efficient as

00:10:21.455 --> 00:10:23.755
Google Gemini, it will most likely get

00:10:23.755 --> 00:10:26.255
there shortly, and both will continue to

00:10:26.255 --> 00:10:28.745
become more, not less, energy-efficient.

00:10:29.035 --> 00:10:30.835
So, you’ll excuse me if

00:10:30.835 --> 00:10:32.645
I flit between the terms.

00:10:33.255 --> 00:10:36.265
Now, in the interests of balance, there

00:10:36.275 --> 00:10:39.025
have been some criticisms of this Google

00:10:39.035 --> 00:10:41.535
study, with commentators pointing out

00:10:42.005 --> 00:10:44.205
that it doesn’t take into account factors

00:10:44.205 --> 00:10:47.315
like the training of the AI model or the

00:10:47.335 --> 00:10:50.215
carbon cost of the AI chips themselves.

00:10:50.785 --> 00:10:54.125
But even taking these into account,

00:10:54.565 --> 00:10:56.915
the effect is still negligible.

00:10:57.905 --> 00:11:00.115
To put it in perspective again,

00:11:00.455 --> 00:11:03.035
taking everything into account, a

00:11:03.035 --> 00:11:05.925
single AI query, based on recent

00:11:05.955 --> 00:11:08.935
estimates, is like uploading 9 photos

00:11:09.125 --> 00:11:11.425
to social media, leaving a digital

00:11:11.435 --> 00:11:15.005
alarm clock on for 50 minutes, or

00:11:15.005 --> 00:11:18.415
streaming Netflix for 30 seconds.

00:11:19.015 --> 00:11:22.225
These are things most of us don’t

00:11:22.225 --> 00:11:25.065
think twice about, yet it is AI

00:11:25.295 --> 00:11:26.975
that has come under the spotlight.

00:11:27.605 --> 00:11:29.655
The news is full of articles with

00:11:29.665 --> 00:11:32.565
headlines like “training an AI model is

00:11:32.575 --> 00:11:35.985
like 550 return flights from New York to

00:11:35.985 --> 00:11:39.685
San Francisco”, or that “ChatGPT emits as

00:11:39.685 --> 00:11:43.995
much CO2 as 20,000 American households”.

00:11:44.985 --> 00:11:47.395
Or, of course, even by the BBC,

00:11:47.645 --> 00:11:51.635
which should know better, “AI uses 27

00:11:51.635 --> 00:11:53.875
million bottles of water in Scotland”.

00:11:54.905 --> 00:11:57.960
Yes, the total energy impact of

00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:00.425
AI has grown incredibly quickly,

00:12:00.875 --> 00:12:03.025
but it started from zero.

00:12:03.965 --> 00:12:07.075
ChatGPT went from zero to 100

00:12:07.075 --> 00:12:09.545
million users in under a year.

00:12:10.455 --> 00:12:15.835
By July 2025, it had 700 million users,

00:12:16.215 --> 00:12:18.965
10% of the world’s adult population,

00:12:19.425 --> 00:12:23.965
sending 18 billion messages every week.

00:12:25.035 --> 00:12:27.685
Now, those numbers will be higher, and it

00:12:27.685 --> 00:12:30.135
looks like they will continue to trend up.

00:12:31.075 --> 00:12:32.955
Using a tiny amount of energy

00:12:33.375 --> 00:12:35.865
18 billion times a week, well,

00:12:36.195 --> 00:12:38.835
it does add up, and this is part

00:12:38.985 --> 00:12:40.625
of where the concern comes from.

00:12:41.705 --> 00:12:45.695
But, even when all global AI use is

00:12:45.755 --> 00:12:48.275
added together, it still doesn’t even

00:12:48.345 --> 00:12:51.045
add up to a fraction of a per cent.

00:12:52.065 --> 00:12:54.475
And to think, this is a technology

00:12:54.795 --> 00:12:57.915
that is being used by 1 in every 10

00:12:57.975 --> 00:13:00.305
adults, voluntarily, I should add.

00:13:00.985 --> 00:13:03.705
Sure, ChatGPT or other AI

00:13:03.785 --> 00:13:06.155
models aren’t perfect, and you

00:13:06.155 --> 00:13:07.365
might not use them yourself.

00:13:08.015 --> 00:13:11.515
But they can be incredibly helpful, saving

00:13:11.515 --> 00:13:13.565
you time, making you more productive,

00:13:13.945 --> 00:13:16.695
and assisting you in a myriad of ways.

00:13:17.585 --> 00:13:20.085
When you think about it, technology is

00:13:20.085 --> 00:13:23.245
incredibly efficient in its energy use.

00:13:23.875 --> 00:13:26.335
Every data centre in the world, so

00:13:26.675 --> 00:13:28.425
that’s the computers powering the

00:13:28.425 --> 00:13:31.915
entire internet, not just AI, uses

00:13:31.915 --> 00:13:35.025
1.5% of the world’s electricity

00:13:35.365 --> 00:13:38.965
and 0.23% of the world’s energy.

00:13:39.895 --> 00:13:41.985
And to think, the average person

00:13:42.235 --> 00:13:45.765
spends six and a half hours per day

00:13:46.095 --> 00:13:48.955
online, interacting with data centres.

00:13:49.955 --> 00:13:51.815
In many ways, it's a miracle

00:13:52.115 --> 00:13:53.525
that something that’s now so

00:13:53.595 --> 00:13:56.365
fundamental to our lives has

00:13:56.365 --> 00:13:58.745
such a tiny environmental impact.

00:13:59.895 --> 00:14:02.685
And of course, if we are to compare

00:14:02.975 --> 00:14:05.065
any of these technological uses

00:14:05.265 --> 00:14:07.905
to “offline” energy uses, the

00:14:07.905 --> 00:14:10.455
difference is even more pronounced.

00:14:11.405 --> 00:14:14.955
Producing one burger requires around

00:14:15.141 --> 00:14:18.935
2,000 litres of water, enough to run

00:14:19.155 --> 00:14:23.325
almost 10 million Google Gemini queries,

00:14:23.545 --> 00:14:27.395
nearly 300 a day, for 100 years.

00:14:28.155 --> 00:14:30.825
Now, this is not for me to say you should

00:14:30.825 --> 00:14:33.375
stop eating burgers or never take an

00:14:33.385 --> 00:14:35.565
aeroplane again; that’s not my point.

00:14:36.215 --> 00:14:38.915
Rather, it’s that to think that you should

00:14:38.925 --> 00:14:42.365
restrict your personal use of ChatGPT, but

00:14:42.365 --> 00:14:44.895
still go to McDonald’s is like deciding

00:14:44.895 --> 00:14:47.875
you’re going to cycle to take a private

00:14:47.875 --> 00:14:51.175
plane; it is wildly misunderstanding

00:14:51.325 --> 00:14:53.385
the impact of the two activities.

00:14:53.955 --> 00:14:55.925
But there is one point that’s

00:14:55.925 --> 00:14:58.515
worth pointing out, and that is

00:14:58.515 --> 00:15:00.605
relating to the type of energy

00:15:00.765 --> 00:15:02.815
that’s used in these data centres.

00:15:03.595 --> 00:15:06.635
When you use ChatGPT or any other

00:15:06.635 --> 00:15:10.095
model, your query is typically routed

00:15:10.405 --> 00:15:12.755
to the nearest data centre to you.

00:15:13.725 --> 00:15:16.475
The environmental impact of each request

00:15:16.705 --> 00:15:19.275
is largely dependent on the type of

00:15:19.315 --> 00:15:22.135
energy used to power that data centre.

00:15:22.975 --> 00:15:25.955
And given the heavy electricity

00:15:25.955 --> 00:15:28.485
requirements, these data centres

00:15:28.715 --> 00:15:31.355
are often powered by dirtier

00:15:31.585 --> 00:15:34.875
energy sources such as coal or oil.

00:15:35.715 --> 00:15:38.665
This is part of the reason technology

00:15:38.665 --> 00:15:41.525
companies are busy pledging to switch to

00:15:41.565 --> 00:15:44.225
cleaner energy sources —not necessarily

00:15:44.405 --> 00:15:47.175
because they have some inherent love

00:15:47.205 --> 00:15:49.635
for the environment, but because

00:15:49.635 --> 00:15:51.720
the cleaner the energy used in their

00:15:51.805 --> 00:15:54.155
data centres, the less ammunition

00:15:54.325 --> 00:15:56.435
environmental critics have against them.

00:15:57.605 --> 00:15:58.991
And there’s more.

00:15:59.675 --> 00:16:03.125
Water use might be a non-issue in the

00:16:03.125 --> 00:16:06.545
wet and rainy country of Scotland, but

00:16:06.925 --> 00:16:09.705
in countries less blessed by constant

00:16:09.755 --> 00:16:12.665
showers and flowing rivers, it is.

00:16:13.415 --> 00:16:15.875
Whether that’s in the Middle East or in

00:16:15.895 --> 00:16:19.415
Arizona, every litre of water that goes

00:16:19.435 --> 00:16:21.745
to a data centre is a litre of water

00:16:22.085 --> 00:16:24.025
that isn’t available for something else.

00:16:25.345 --> 00:16:28.075
And the sheer scale of the growth

00:16:28.105 --> 00:16:30.405
in AI, and the data centres

00:16:30.555 --> 00:16:33.515
required for this, is mindboggling.

00:16:34.335 --> 00:16:37.405
By some estimates, the energy demand from

00:16:37.405 --> 00:16:40.825
data centres is set to double by 2030,

00:16:41.125 --> 00:16:44.591
with half of this growth driven by AI.

00:16:45.955 --> 00:16:48.165
And “personal” AI use

00:16:48.355 --> 00:16:49.805
is just a slice of this.

00:16:50.375 --> 00:16:53.745
By personal AI use, I mean an individual,

00:16:53.945 --> 00:16:57.185
you or me, or any of the other hundreds

00:16:57.185 --> 00:17:00.001
of millions of people using ChatGPT

00:17:00.025 --> 00:17:03.025
or other AI tools, and going into

00:17:03.025 --> 00:17:05.425
the interface and asking a question.

00:17:06.465 --> 00:17:09.995
There is also all of the behind-the-scenes

00:17:10.125 --> 00:17:12.265
use of AI by companies, whether

00:17:12.265 --> 00:17:15.385
that’s companies using AI models for

00:17:15.385 --> 00:17:17.205
their internal business processes

00:17:17.595 --> 00:17:19.945
or it’s the AI companies themselves.

00:17:20.625 --> 00:17:23.925
So even if you never choose to use

00:17:23.965 --> 00:17:26.985
AI tools personally, every time you

00:17:27.035 --> 00:17:28.745
interact with a technology company,

00:17:29.175 --> 00:17:31.695
you will most probably be using some

00:17:31.755 --> 00:17:34.395
form of AI, whether you like it or not.

00:17:35.835 --> 00:17:38.795
So, to wrap things up, global AI

00:17:38.825 --> 00:17:41.595
use is probably at the lowest it

00:17:41.595 --> 00:17:44.155
will ever be in your or my lifetime.

00:17:44.795 --> 00:17:47.385
New models are coming out almost every

00:17:47.385 --> 00:17:51.625
week, adoption is increasing fast, and AI

00:17:51.925 --> 00:17:54.095
is being deployed into everything we do.

00:17:54.775 --> 00:17:57.435
Yes, it might use significantly more

00:17:57.435 --> 00:17:59.825
energy than things like traditional Google

00:17:59.825 --> 00:18:03.215
searches, but it is far from the worst

00:18:03.215 --> 00:18:06.115
thing you can do with a computer, and its

00:18:06.135 --> 00:18:09.395
environmental impact pales in comparison

00:18:09.595 --> 00:18:11.915
with most things you do in the real world.

00:18:12.865 --> 00:18:15.565
And the good news is that AI is getting

00:18:15.565 --> 00:18:18.145
much more energy-efficient, with that

00:18:18.145 --> 00:18:20.635
Google study reporting that energy use

00:18:20.855 --> 00:18:24.645
for each query is now 3% of what it

00:18:24.645 --> 00:18:28.495
was a year ago, a 33-fold reduction.

00:18:29.375 --> 00:18:33.365
Yes, AI does have an impact on the

00:18:33.365 --> 00:18:36.075
environment, but on an individual

00:18:36.075 --> 00:18:38.805
level, it offers a miraculous reward

00:18:39.095 --> 00:18:41.765
for a minuscule environmental cost.

00:18:42.565 --> 00:18:44.095
When it comes to reducing your personal

00:18:44.095 --> 00:18:46.155
carbon footprint, there are dozens

00:18:46.425 --> 00:18:49.265
of lifestyle changes, such as flying

00:18:49.265 --> 00:18:51.515
less and taking public transport,

00:18:51.795 --> 00:18:53.815
that would have a vastly greater

00:18:53.825 --> 00:18:56.190
impact than your personal use of AI.

00:18:57.247 --> 00:19:00.840
So, it's up to you, but if you ask me

00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:04.055
whether I’d prefer to skip one burger, or

00:19:04.055 --> 00:19:06.815
not use AI again for the rest of my life,

00:19:07.295 --> 00:19:09.075
I think you can guess what I would say.

00:19:09.995 --> 00:19:12.625
OK, then, that is it for today's episode

00:19:12.845 --> 00:19:15.464
on the environmental impact on AI.

00:19:15.655 --> 00:19:16.965
I hope it's been an interesting one

00:19:17.195 --> 00:19:19.195
and that you've learnt something new.

00:19:19.535 --> 00:19:21.115
As always, I would love to know

00:19:21.115 --> 00:19:22.735
what you thought of this episode.

00:19:23.135 --> 00:19:25.135
What had you heard about the

00:19:25.135 --> 00:19:27.035
environmental impact of AI?

00:19:27.365 --> 00:19:28.755
Had you changed your behaviour,

00:19:29.015 --> 00:19:30.825
or will you change your behaviour

00:19:31.195 --> 00:19:32.235
after listening to this?

00:19:32.625 --> 00:19:33.575
I would love to know.

00:19:33.845 --> 00:19:35.965
