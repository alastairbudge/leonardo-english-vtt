Hello, hello, hello, and welcome

00:00:07.699 --> 00:00:09.539
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:12.229
Minds, by Leonardo English, the show

00:00:12.239 --> 00:00:13.949
where you can listen to fascinating

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:16.319
stories and learn weird and wonderful

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:18.299
things about the world at the same

00:00:18.299 --> 00:00:20.119
time as improving your English.

00:00:20.629 --> 00:00:23.359
I'm Alastair Budge, and today it is

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:25.739
part two of our three-part mini-series

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.809
on “Young, American Outlaws”.

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:30.119
In case you missed part one, it

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.219
was on Ross Ulbricht, the man

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.819
who founded the world’s biggest

00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:36.489
online drug marketplace, Silk Road.

00:00:36.939 --> 00:00:39.659
Next up, part three will be on Luigi

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:41.849
Mangione, the young man who gunned

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:44.129
down the CEO of one of America’s

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:46.159
largest health insurance companies.

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:49.409
And this episode, part two, will

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:51.779
be on a man called Aaron Swartz.

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:54.729
He was one of the most gifted technical

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:57.279
minds of his generation, a founding team

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:00.229
member of the website Reddit and a vocal

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:03.219
advocate for a free and open internet.

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:05.989
In this quest, however, he

00:01:05.989 --> 00:01:07.239
got on the wrong side of the

00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:09.789
law, and it ended in tragedy.

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:12.479
So, let’s not waste a minute

00:01:12.879 --> 00:01:14.479
and get right into it.

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:17.149
If you were going to picture the

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:19.709
scene of a great crime, the campus

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:23.225
at MIT–The Massachusetts Institute

00:01:23.225 --> 00:01:25.199
of Technology–might not be the

00:01:25.199 --> 00:01:27.109
first thing that comes to mind.

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:30.389
Young men and women studying together,

00:01:30.809 --> 00:01:33.409
hunched over laptops, furiously trying to

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:35.829
make a deadline for a paper, their eyes

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:38.579
only remaining open thanks to copious

00:01:38.589 --> 00:01:41.109
amounts of energy drinks and coffee.

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:45.729
Yet it was here, or to be precise, in

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:48.609
a utility closet on campus, that one

00:01:48.629 --> 00:01:50.919
of the greatest thefts of intellectual

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:53.199
property in history was committed.

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:57.219
Or, if you ask someone else, that a young

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:00.449
man did something that harmed nobody, from

00:02:00.449 --> 00:02:03.219
which he made no personal gain, and the

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:06.129
goal of which was to make knowledge freely

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:08.809
available to anyone who wanted to learn.

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.099
That criminal, or hero, was Aaron

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:16.029
Swartz, a then 24-year-old computer

00:02:16.029 --> 00:02:18.359
programmer and internet activist.

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:22.489
What followed was a two-year battle with

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.119
the US Justice Department, a national

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:28.079
debate on censorship, copyright, and

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:30.959
freedom of information, and tragically

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.349
ended in Swartz being found dead in his

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:37.379
Brooklyn apartment at the age of 26.

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:42.029
His life was short, but his contributions,

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:44.669
not just to the debate on copyright

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:47.199
but also to the technology and systems

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:50.439
we still use today, were significant.

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:55.599
He was born in 1986, so he was very much

00:02:55.649 --> 00:02:58.379
part of the generation that grew up as

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:00.309
the Internet was just getting started.

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.949
He was closer to “the action” than most,

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:06.029
as his father worked in technology,

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:08.399
so there was always a computer at

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:10.419
home he could tinker around with.

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:13.689
And from an early age,

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:15.479
he was very interested in

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:17.669
computers and how they worked.

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:20.729
It’s fascinating listening to him

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:22.539
talk about this early period of his

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:25.039
life–the early years of the World Wide

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:28.299
Web–and his hopes and dreams about

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:30.689
what this might become, how it would

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:33.299
democratise access to information, how

00:03:33.529 --> 00:03:36.159
anyone from anywhere in the world could

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:38.689
connect with anyone else over shared,

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:41.659
mutual interests, no matter how niche.

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:45.819
He grew up in a small community, and

00:03:46.065 --> 00:03:47.989
there were only a handful of people like

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:51.009
him, with the same interests and hobbies.

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:54.439
But on the internet, this growing

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:56.689
magical community, he found

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:59.489
kindred spirits, people who shared

00:03:59.499 --> 00:04:00.959
the same interests as he did.

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:03.269
He found his people.

00:04:04.529 --> 00:04:06.979
And this wasn’t just a boy posting

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.369
messages on forums; he was an active

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:11.529
contributor to the architecture

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:13.619
of the Internet, not just building

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:15.789
websites but also working on the

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:18.429
systems and technologies behind them.

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:22.549
When he was only 12 years old, he built

00:04:22.549 --> 00:04:24.919
something called The Info Network,

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:27.329
which was a user-generated encyclopedia.

00:04:28.429 --> 00:04:30.319
Wikipedia, essentially, but

00:04:30.546 --> 00:04:32.489
3 years before Wikipedia.

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:36.159
Just a few years later, he became a core

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:39.351
contributor to the group that made RSS.

00:04:40.079 --> 00:04:43.832
Now, without getting too technical, RSS

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:46.439
is the technology that allows users to

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:49.339
get information in a standardised format.

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:52.259
It’s used for news syndication, it’s

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:55.099
also used for podcasts, and it means that

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:58.189
you can open up a podcast app, subscribe

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:01.449
to different podcasts, and new episodes

00:05:01.609 --> 00:05:03.439
automatically appear in your feed.

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:06.009
It’s probably something you’ve never

00:05:06.019 --> 00:05:08.589
thought too much about before, but

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:11.589
someone had to envision and create

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:13.559
this standardised feed technology,

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:15.779
and that person, or at least

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:17.509
one of the people in that group,

00:05:17.829 --> 00:05:20.219
was a then-teenage Aaron Swartz.

00:05:21.649 --> 00:05:23.739
Importantly, this technology

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:26.329
is Open Source; it’s free.

00:05:27.459 --> 00:05:31.049
As a publisher, podcaster or user of

00:05:31.049 --> 00:05:35.099
RSS, you don’t need to pay RSS.com, the

00:05:35.359 --> 00:05:38.449
creators of RSS, or anyone to use it.

00:05:38.929 --> 00:05:39.619
It’s free.

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:43.529
Swartz and his fellow contributors behind

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:46.699
RSS believed this technology should

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:49.949
exist; they built it, and they decided it

00:05:49.959 --> 00:05:52.459
should be freely accessible to everyone.

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:54.949
So that’s what it is.

00:05:56.459 --> 00:05:58.724
These contributions made him something of

00:05:58.779 --> 00:06:01.409
a household name in certain programming

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:03.679
circles; he would be invited to speak

00:06:03.679 --> 00:06:06.369
at conferences and give interviews, and

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:08.599
people who didn’t know anything about him

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:11.599
would be somewhat surprised when the name

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:14.179
“Aaron Swartz” would be announced and a

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:16.959
15-year-old boy would take to the stage.

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:20.929
But he spoke with great clarity,

00:06:21.179 --> 00:06:23.539
he was exceptionally talented, and

00:06:23.739 --> 00:06:26.419
was treated as a peer by some of

00:06:26.429 --> 00:06:28.509
the most influential people in the

00:06:28.559 --> 00:06:30.209
early days of the World Wide Web.

00:06:31.489 --> 00:06:33.779
He was accepted at Stanford at the age

00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:37.359
of 17, but quickly dropped out, later

00:06:37.359 --> 00:06:39.619
saying he was disillusioned with what

00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:42.649
he saw as a culture more focused on

00:06:42.649 --> 00:06:45.269
status and lifestyle than on learning

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:49.019
At the age of 19, he founded a

00:06:49.019 --> 00:06:51.589
start-up called Infogami, which

00:06:51.769 --> 00:06:53.759
shortly afterwards merged with

00:06:53.789 --> 00:06:56.209
another fledgling site called Reddit.

00:06:57.729 --> 00:07:00.719
Reddit, as you probably know, is now

00:07:00.719 --> 00:07:03.059
one of the most visited websites in the

00:07:03.059 --> 00:07:06.249
world, with hundreds of millions of users

00:07:06.329 --> 00:07:09.689
posting, voting, and commenting every day.

00:07:11.239 --> 00:07:14.140
It is, essentially, what Aaron Swartz

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:16.013
had always hoped the internet would be,

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:19.200
a place for people to find like-minded

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.300
souls and connect over shared interests,

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.910
no matter how niche and obscure.

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:28.630
After this merger, he became part of

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:31.180
the small founding team, and when Reddit

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.320
was bought by the giant publishing

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:37.030
house Condé Nast in 2006, he suddenly

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:39.490
found himself with seven figures in his

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.630
bank account and working inside one of

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:45.240
America’s largest media corporations.

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:48.680
This was not where Aaron

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:49.810
Swartz wanted to be.

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:53.090
He didn’t care about the money or the

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:55.420
prestige of working for a big company.

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:58.130
His lifestyle didn’t change in the

00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:00.950
slightest, and this newly minted

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:03.080
millionaire continued to live in

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.430
a flatshare, in a bedroom so small

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:07.980
it was referred to as “the closet”.

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:11.980
What he cared about was freedom

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:14.280
of information, the power of the

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:16.590
internet, and the potential for

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:19.180
technology to change society.

00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:22.580
Anyone who knew him knew that he

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:24.380
wouldn’t hack it in the corporate

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:27.563
world, and sure enough, he left Condé

00:08:27.563 --> 00:08:30.530
Nast after just a year, saying he felt

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:33.000
stifled by the corporate environment.

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:37.150
Afterwards, and now financially free

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:40.030
and not beholden to anyone, he threw

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:43.510
himself into his true passion: activism.

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:47.610
He worked with Creative Commons, the

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.820
organisation that allows authors and

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:52.240
artists to license their work freely

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:54.037
so that others can build upon it.

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:56.430
He started groups campaigning

00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:57.840
for government transparency

00:08:58.010 --> 00:08:59.070
and accountability.

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:02.290
And he became deeply involved in the

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:05.230
debate over copyright law, arguing

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:08.120
that copyright was too restrictive and

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:11.330
unfairly limited access to knowledge.

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:15.690
In 2008, he published what became known

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:19.270
as the “Guerilla Open Access Manifesto”.

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:23.640
In it, he argued that scientists and

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:26.590
researchers had a moral responsibility

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:29.930
to share their work freely, and that

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:32.170
ordinary people should take action

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:34.970
if necessary to liberate information

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.360
that was being unjustly restricted.

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:41.430
In his words: “Information is power.

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:44.710
But like all power, there are those

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:46.410
who want to keep it for themselves.

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.780
With enough of us, around the world,

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:51.860
we’ll not just send a strong message

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:53.790
opposing the privatization of knowledge

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:56.600
— we’ll make it a thing of the past.”

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:01.100
It was a radical message, and it was one

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:03.780
he would soon try to put into action.

00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:08.090
His first target was the millions of

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:10.650
American public court documents that were

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:12.640
not covered by any kind of copyright,

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:15.850
but for which the US government charged

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:19.240
$0.08 per page for users to access.

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:23.520
Swartz believed these should be free,

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:28.090
especially as the court system made a $150

00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:31.150
million a year profit from selling them.

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:35.230
He wrote a script that downloaded them

00:10:35.407 --> 00:10:38.950
en masse and managed to download 20

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.520
million pages of court documents—an

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:44.080
estimated 20% of the total.

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:47.900
His intention was to make them publicly

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:50.770
available, free of charge, because they

00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:53.150
were items of public record, after all.

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:57.010
He was caught and questioned by the

00:10:57.010 --> 00:10:59.980
FBI, but no charges were pressed.

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:03.010
It would be his first brush with the

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:06.190
law, but unfortunately not the last.

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:11.290
A year later, he set his sights on JSTOR,

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:14.220
which, if you went to university at any

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:16.910
point in the last 20 years or so, you

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:19.190
might remember as one of the largest

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.700
digital libraries of academic papers.

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:25.520
JSTOR contains millions of articles

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:28.310
from thousands of journals, covering

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:30.490
virtually every field of knowledge.

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:34.000
Swartz thought it was morally wrong

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:36.400
that these millions of academic papers

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.680
and journals, which had often been

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:41.830
funded by taxpayers’ money, were

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:44.590
locked away behind expensive paywalls.

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:47.370
This was…wrong.

00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:50.650
Knowledge, he believed, should not be

00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:53.020
locked up by governments or corporations.

00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:55.380
It should be open and available

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:57.790
to everyone, everywhere.

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:01.710
JSTOR kept the gates closed.

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:04.610
So Swartz set out to

00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:05.722
do something about it.

00:12:06.742 --> 00:12:09.020
As he put in his earlier manifesto,

00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:10.900
“We need to take information,

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:12.990
wherever it is stored, make our

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:15.160
copies and share them with the world”

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:18.960
Using the network at MIT,

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:21.160
he began systematically

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:23.560
downloading articles from JSTOR.

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:27.720
This wasn’t “stealing”, per se; he had

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:30.840
a valid individual JSTOR account via

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:33.307
Harvard, where he was a research fellow.

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:35.940
The difference was that he wasn’t

00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:38.190
using his account as it was intended;

00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:40.600
he wasn’t downloading single files,

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:42.860
manually going to each one and

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:45.240
clicking “download” with his mouse.

00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:48.580
Using similar techniques to those he

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:51.050
had used to download millions of pages

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:53.700
of court documents, he wrote automated

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:55.890
scripts to download millions of

00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:58.730
research papers from the JSTOR database.

00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:02.420
At first, he used his own laptop,

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:04.330
sitting in campus libraries.

00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:07.540
It was fast, but not fast enough.

00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:11.020
Eventually, he went so far as to

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:13.590
sneak into a locked utility closet,

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:16.200
where he hid a laptop connected

00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:18.690
directly to MIT’s network so it could

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:20.850
download files around the clock.

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:24.570
Over the course of a few weeks, JSTOR

00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:27.320
engineers noticed strange activity.

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:30.350
Their servers were being hammered

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:33.070
with download requests, far more

00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:35.160
than a normal user would ever make.

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:38.430
They traced it back to MIT, and

00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:40.330
eventually to the closet where

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:41.920
Swartz’s laptop was hidden.

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:44.840
The police were called in.

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:46.710
They located the closet

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:48.150
and found the laptop.

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:50.980
But instead of taking the computer

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:53.660
away and trying to find its owner by

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:55.770
hacking into it, they did something

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.840
less high-tech but more effective.

00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:02.470
They planted a hidden camera, assuming

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:04.180
that they would be able to catch the

00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:06.940
perpetrator red-handed, in the act.

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:10.760
And sure enough, shortly afterwards,

00:14:10.981 --> 00:14:13.460
Swartz could be plainly seen coming

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:15.910
into the closet and taking the laptop.

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:19.110
Police didn’t arrive in time to

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:21.840
arrest him in the closet, but he

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:24.310
was spotted shortly afterwards, and

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:27.700
in January 2011, he was arrested.

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:30.350
The laptop was seized, and

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:32.730
the FBI soon became involved.

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.290
Importantly, he hadn’t yet done

00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:37.850
anything with the files he had

00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:40.510
downloaded, and he returned them all.

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:44.640
And JSTOR, the supposed victim of the

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:47.630
crime, decided not to press charges.

00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:51.270
They quickly settled, and the organisation

00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:53.870
even released a public statement saying

00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:56.870
it did not wish to see Swartz punished.

00:14:58.410 --> 00:15:00.790
And it was assumed that MIT–the

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:03.240
Massachusetts Institute of Technology,

00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:06.040
the home of many a hacker–would be

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:08.520
supportive of Swartz, keen for him to get

00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:11.080
off with a slap on the wrist and nothing

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:14.220
more, and would intervene on his behalf.

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:16.040
It did not.

00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:19.320
And Swartz found himself up

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:21.230
against the full weight of the

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:23.010
U.S. Department of Justice.

00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:27.180
Federal prosecutors stepped in and charged

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:29.610
him with multiple counts of computer fraud

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:32.720
and wire fraud, which carried a maximum

00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:35.980
possible sentence of 35 years in prison.

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:39.200
For downloading academic articles.

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:42.950
To many people, not just his

00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:45.040
friends and supporters, but people

00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:46.670
finding out about Swartz for the

00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:49.870
first time, this seemed absurd.

00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:53.170
Thirty-five years in prison was the kind

00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:56.460
of sentence given to violent criminals–to

00:15:56.770 --> 00:16:00.160
armed robbers, murderers, and rapists–not

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:02.230
to a young man who had downloaded

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:04.940
publicly accessible academic journals.

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:07.850
And remember, he hadn’t sold the

00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:10.320
files, hadn’t shared or published them,

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:13.045
hadn’t made a cent from any of it.

00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:17.480
His goal was ideological, not financial.

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:20.640
He believed that this knowledge should

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:23.280
not be locked away, it should be free for

00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:25.860
anyone, anywhere, who wanted to learn.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.600
But prosecutors didn’t see it that way.

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:32.103
They wanted to make an example of him.

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:34.890
In their eyes, he wasn’t

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:36.550
a principled activist.

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:39.000
He was a thief, someone who

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.890
had broken into a system to

00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:42.780
steal millions of documents.

00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:46.330
As the lead federal prosecutor put

00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:49.260
it, “Stealing is stealing, whether you

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:52.160
use a computer command or a crowbar.”

00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:55.770
A crowbar, by the way, is a metal

00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:58.210
bar often used by criminals to

00:16:58.210 --> 00:16:59.920
force their way into something.

00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:03.890
As the months went on, the pressure grew.

00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:07.230
Each time his lawyers tried to

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:09.740
negotiate a deal, prosecutors

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:11.750
pushed for harsher terms.

00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:14.900
He faced the possibility of decades in

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:17.580
prison and ruinous financial penalties

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:19.950
unless he pleaded guilty to a felony.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.580
This plea deal would mean

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:25.270
spending six months behind bars.

00:17:26.330 --> 00:17:28.180
Still, for someone who was only

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:30.930
24, it was a terrifying prospect.

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:34.570
Pleading guilty would mean admitting

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:37.370
guilt, admitting he had committed a crime.

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:40.870
He would be marked for life as a felon,

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:43.380
something he simply didn’t believe he was.

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:47.430
During all this time, he didn’t stop

00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:49.580
his campaign for internet freedom.

00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:53.730
In 2012, while his trial was still

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:56.110
looming, he played a central role

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:57.810
in one of the most successful

00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:59.430
online protests in history.

00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:02.540
That year, the U.S. Congress was

00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:04.550
preparing to vote on a law called

00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:08.010
SOPA, the Stop Online Piracy Act.

00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:11.330
On the surface, it was about

00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:12.950
preventing copyright theft.

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:16.160
But in practice, it gave the

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.590
government sweeping new powers to

00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:20.780
shut down websites, block domain

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:23.360
names, and censor online content.

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:26.810
To Swartz and many others, it was a

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:29.370
direct threat to the open internet.

00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:33.100
He co-founded an organisation called

00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:36.200
Demand Progress, which mobilised millions

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:39.548
of people online to protest against SOPA.

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:44.820
On 18 January 2012, websites including

00:18:45.050 --> 00:18:47.740
Wikipedia, Reddit, and thousands

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:50.200
of others went dark in protest.

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:53.080
The result was extraordinary.

00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:57.000
Within days, politicians who had supported

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.270
the bill backed down, and SOPA was dead.

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.650
He had helped stop what he and

00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:05.560
many others believed would have

00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:07.420
been the end of the free internet.

00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:10.010
He was hailed as a hero by

00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:12.180
activists, programmers, and

00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:14.090
ordinary internet users alike.

00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:18.070
But even as his reputation in

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:20.400
those circles grew, the criminal

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:22.280
case against him dragged on.

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:25.160
The prosecutors didn’t care that

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:26.870
JSTOR had dropped its complaint.

00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:28.350
They didn’t care about his

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:30.060
contributions to the public

00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:32.280
internet or how well-respected he

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:34.150
was in the programming community.

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:36.670
They cared that he had broken the

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:39.700
law, and they were determined to win.

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:44.310
By early 2013, Swartz was exhausted.

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:45.890
He had struggled with

00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:47.540
depression for years.

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:50.210
Friends described him as brilliant

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:53.100
but often fragile, deeply

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:56.050
idealistic but weighed down by the

00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:58.390
injustices he saw in the world.

00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:02.020
The looming trial magnified these

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:04.870
struggles, these demons he couldn’t shake.

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:08.320
Friends said he was deeply depressed,

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:10.860
worn down by the endless legal

00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:13.140
battle and the weight of the

00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:15.340
possible sentence hanging over him.

00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:18.260
He had spent two years fighting, and

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:20.090
it seemed like there was no way out.

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:22.280
It looked highly likely that he was

00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:24.190
going to prison for a long time,

00:20:24.610 --> 00:20:26.970
and he was powerless to stop it.

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:32.150
On 11 January 2013, his girlfriend

00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:34.310
came back to their Brooklyn apartment

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:37.420
to find him dead, hanging by his belt.

00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:39.900
He was 26 years old.

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:43.520
His death sent shockwaves through

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:45.780
the world of technology and beyond.

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:49.570
There was grief, anger, and disbelief.

00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:52.930
To many, it seemed like the U.S.

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:55.500
government had hounded a young,

00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:58.080
brilliant technologist to his death.

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:01.750
MIT and the Department of Justice

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:03.250
came under heavy criticism.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.460
Why had they pursued the case so

00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:09.580
aggressively, especially when the supposed

00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:12.620
victim, JSTOR, wanted no part in it?

00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:15.160
Why had they refused to offer

00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:17.260
a fairer plea deal, one that

00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:18.860
didn’t involve prison time?

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:20.370
He was the least violent

00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:21.390
person imaginable.

00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:25.430
In the aftermath, he became a symbol.

00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:28.220
A symbol of the dangers of government

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:31.200
overreach, of the harshness of America’s

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:33.440
criminal justice system, but also

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:35.780
of the potential of the internet to

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:38.040
challenge power and change the world.

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:42.230
His legacy lives on in the technology

00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:44.580
he helped build and in the movements

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:47.470
he inspired: the fight for open

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:49.900
access to knowledge, for transparency,

00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:52.490
and for a truly free internet.

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:55.570
Yet his story also leaves

00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:58.160
us with important, sometimes

00:21:58.250 --> 00:21:59.530
uncomfortable, questions.

00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:03.560
Should acts of digital civil disobedience

00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:05.370
be punished like violent crime?

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:08.530
Is there any moral difference between a

00:22:08.550 --> 00:22:11.310
crime committed for personal enrichment

00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:13.630
and one committed for the common good?

00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:16.470
And what does Aaron Swartz’s death

00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:18.640
tell us about the society we live

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:20.690
in, and the price of fighting

00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:22.720
for freedom in the digital age?

00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:25.550
Depending on how you answer those

00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:27.720
questions, there is probably another one.

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:30.190
Was Aaron Swartz a dangerous

00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:32.060
criminal or one of the great

00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:34.130
martyrs of the Internet age?

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:37.340
OK, then, that is it for

00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:39.530
today's episode on Aaron Swartz.

00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:41.080
