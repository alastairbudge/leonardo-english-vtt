Hello, hello, hello, and welcome

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.889
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:12.710
Minds, by Leonardo English, the show

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.629
where you can listen to fascinating

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.190
stories and learn weird and wonderful

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:19.180
things about the world at the same

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:20.820
time as improving your English.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.980
I'm Alastair Budge, and today it

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.569
is the start of another three-part

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.059
mini-series, this time on the

00:00:29.059 --> 00:00:31.480
making of modern Saudi Arabia.

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:34.339
In part one, today’s episode, we’ll

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.449
be talking about the rise of the

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.017
man behind it, Mohammed Bin Salman,

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.930
or MBS, as he is often known.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.810
In part two, we’ll turn to one of the most

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.779
ambitious, almost science-fiction-like

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:52.270
projects of the 21st century: a planned

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:55.890
desert city of the future, 500 metres

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.270
high and 170 kilometres long, called NEOM.

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.170
And in part three, we are going to

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.730
look at a somewhat darker chapter:

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.739
the blood-curdling murder of the

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:10.935
dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

00:01:11.318 --> 00:01:13.518
OK then, let's not waste a

00:01:13.528 --> 00:01:15.938
minute and get right into it.

00:01:16.998 --> 00:01:19.978
If you went up to a random person on the

00:01:19.978 --> 00:01:23.128
streets of Britain and asked them to name

00:01:23.128 --> 00:01:26.008
as many British princes and princesses

00:01:26.188 --> 00:01:29.578
as possible, my guess is that they might

00:01:29.778 --> 00:01:31.658
be able to name a good chunk of them.

00:01:32.188 --> 00:01:33.768
If you stumbled across someone

00:01:33.998 --> 00:01:36.278
who was a serious royal watcher,

00:01:36.698 --> 00:01:39.742
perhaps they could name all 17.

00:01:40.928 --> 00:01:43.258
In Saudi Arabia, however, I am

00:01:43.258 --> 00:01:45.658
pretty confident that nobody, not

00:01:45.738 --> 00:01:47.728
even the king, would be able to

00:01:47.728 --> 00:01:50.918
name every Saudi prince or princess.

00:01:51.438 --> 00:01:54.108
And even if they could, it would

00:01:54.118 --> 00:01:56.868
take them several hours to list them.

00:01:57.748 --> 00:02:00.708
There is no public list, but it’s

00:02:00.768 --> 00:02:02.918
estimated that there are anywhere

00:02:02.918 --> 00:02:07.758
between 5,000 and 15,000 princes

00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:10.268
and princesses in Saudi Arabia.

00:02:10.898 --> 00:02:13.768
Thousands of people with some claim

00:02:13.968 --> 00:02:16.808
back to the country’s founder, Abdulaziz

00:02:16.828 --> 00:02:20.178
bin Abdul Rahman Al Saud, or Ibn Saud

00:02:20.328 --> 00:02:22.088
as he’s commonly called in the west.

00:02:22.718 --> 00:02:26.358
He had almost 100 children, with

00:02:26.358 --> 00:02:28.498
a mixture of official wives and

00:02:28.528 --> 00:02:32.068
concubines, and most of them went on

00:02:32.228 --> 00:02:34.088
to have large families of their own,

00:02:34.298 --> 00:02:36.708
with each descendant having the right

00:02:36.718 --> 00:02:39.648
to call themself a prince or princess.

00:02:40.268 --> 00:02:43.708
Now, the history of Saudi Arabia, even

00:02:43.858 --> 00:02:46.568
the relatively short history of the modern

00:02:46.658 --> 00:02:49.598
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, is as fascinating

00:02:49.908 --> 00:02:52.498
as it is complicated, and we don’t have

00:02:52.498 --> 00:02:55.028
the time to go into it in detail today.

00:02:55.618 --> 00:02:59.348
But for the purposes of our story, the

00:02:59.358 --> 00:03:02.868
thing to underline is firstly the size

00:03:03.048 --> 00:03:06.008
of the Saudi royal family, and secondly

00:03:06.128 --> 00:03:09.168
how succession works, how the title of

00:03:09.228 --> 00:03:12.838
king passes from one person to the next.

00:03:13.798 --> 00:03:16.978
In a typical monarchy — like Britain,

00:03:17.178 --> 00:03:19.398
Spain, or the Netherlands — the crown

00:03:19.458 --> 00:03:22.838
passes downwards, from ruling male

00:03:23.117 --> 00:03:25.607
to the eldest next eligible male.

00:03:25.907 --> 00:03:27.887
From father to eldest son.

00:03:28.367 --> 00:03:29.977
And if that son has died,

00:03:30.277 --> 00:03:31.617
then to the grandson.

00:03:32.267 --> 00:03:34.577
It follows a straight vertical

00:03:34.587 --> 00:03:36.757
line down the male line of the

00:03:36.757 --> 00:03:39.367
family, with some more forward

00:03:39.417 --> 00:03:41.477
thinking monarchies now allowing

00:03:41.497 --> 00:03:43.377
daughters to be considered as well.

00:03:44.007 --> 00:03:47.037
But Saudi Arabia was very different.

00:03:47.907 --> 00:03:52.057
When Ibn Saud died in 1953, he didn’t

00:03:52.067 --> 00:03:56.617
have one eligible son; he had almost 45

00:03:56.847 --> 00:03:59.317
acknowledged sons, with the oldest in

00:03:59.317 --> 00:04:02.127
his 50s, and the youngest still a boy.

00:04:03.217 --> 00:04:05.157
This created both a

00:04:05.227 --> 00:04:07.947
problem and an opportunity.

00:04:08.817 --> 00:04:10.967
The problem was that many of these

00:04:10.977 --> 00:04:14.177
sons were grown, adult men, with

00:04:14.337 --> 00:04:16.257
military experience, political

00:04:16.267 --> 00:04:18.587
authority, and powerful backers.

00:04:19.217 --> 00:04:22.097
Choosing just one of those sons, or

00:04:22.267 --> 00:04:23.857
one of their children, would have

00:04:23.857 --> 00:04:26.277
meant favouring one branch of this

00:04:26.307 --> 00:04:28.967
enormous family over all the others.

00:04:29.667 --> 00:04:31.937
And with hundreds of princes and

00:04:32.187 --> 00:04:34.567
thousands of descendants, that

00:04:34.693 --> 00:04:36.847
could have led to an immediate, and

00:04:36.957 --> 00:04:39.347
possibly violent, power struggle.

00:04:40.027 --> 00:04:43.757
But the flip side of this was that

00:04:43.757 --> 00:04:46.757
there was an almost 50 year age gap

00:04:46.847 --> 00:04:49.557
between the oldest and the youngest son.

00:04:50.477 --> 00:04:52.497
Saudi Arabia could adopt a

00:04:52.597 --> 00:04:54.657
different system that kept

00:04:54.657 --> 00:04:57.017
things in the same generation.

00:04:57.737 --> 00:05:01.387
Instead of moving vertically — father

00:05:01.387 --> 00:05:03.967
→ son → grandson — the throne could

00:05:03.967 --> 00:05:06.807
move horizontally, from brother to

00:05:06.807 --> 00:05:09.337
brother, staying within the founder’s

00:05:09.337 --> 00:05:11.807
generation for as long as possible.

00:05:12.567 --> 00:05:17.847
So when Ibn Saud died in 1953, the crown

00:05:17.877 --> 00:05:21.127
passed not to one of his sons’ children,

00:05:21.427 --> 00:05:24.707
but to one of his adult sons: King Saud.

00:05:25.457 --> 00:05:27.737
When King Saud was removed from power,

00:05:28.057 --> 00:05:30.417
the crown passed to yet another brother.

00:05:30.787 --> 00:05:31.487
And then another.

00:05:32.007 --> 00:05:32.877
And then another.

00:05:33.627 --> 00:05:37.377
For decades, power moved horizontally

00:05:37.667 --> 00:05:40.227
across a single generation—between

00:05:40.227 --> 00:05:43.077
the dozens of sons of Ibn Saud.

00:05:43.867 --> 00:05:45.957
This was a deliberate decision.

00:05:46.347 --> 00:05:48.117
It kept the peace between

00:05:48.117 --> 00:05:49.307
branches of the family.

00:05:49.737 --> 00:05:51.657
It rewarded seniority,

00:05:51.977 --> 00:05:54.027
experience, and age.

00:05:54.657 --> 00:05:57.207
And, above all, it preserved

00:05:57.307 --> 00:05:59.927
consensus among a very large

00:05:59.977 --> 00:06:02.037
pool of powerful princes.

00:06:02.867 --> 00:06:06.137
But thwas also somethinging

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.177
of a ticking time bomb.

00:06:09.127 --> 00:06:11.917
As time went on, and the founding

00:06:11.917 --> 00:06:15.307
generation began to age, the number of

00:06:15.327 --> 00:06:18.467
potential successors grew dramatically.

00:06:18.977 --> 00:06:21.227
Each of those sons had children.

00:06:21.357 --> 00:06:22.567
Those sons had children.

00:06:22.917 --> 00:06:25.817
And all of them had opinions,

00:06:26.067 --> 00:06:29.257
ambitions, and networks of influence.

00:06:29.847 --> 00:06:31.307
The House of Saud was

00:06:31.307 --> 00:06:32.897
no longer a family tree.

00:06:33.337 --> 00:06:37.067
It was more like a dense, thick forest.

00:06:37.587 --> 00:06:40.747
And by the early 2000s, Saudi Arabia

00:06:41.107 --> 00:06:43.787
had reached a moment of quiet tension.

00:06:44.587 --> 00:06:47.137
Everyone knew the horizontal model

00:06:47.147 --> 00:06:49.367
of succession couldn’t last forever.

00:06:50.177 --> 00:06:53.447
Eventually, the crown would have to

00:06:53.447 --> 00:06:55.817
pass down to the next generation.

00:06:56.407 --> 00:06:58.117
And the next generation was

00:06:58.127 --> 00:07:01.737
huge—dozens upon dozens of princes

00:07:01.827 --> 00:07:04.157
who had grown up with extraordinary

00:07:04.157 --> 00:07:06.117
wealth, political connections,

00:07:06.437 --> 00:07:09.597
and varying degrees of competence.

00:07:09.957 --> 00:07:11.707
Some were talented.

00:07:12.227 --> 00:07:12.817
Some were not.

00:07:13.117 --> 00:07:14.547
Some wanted reform.

00:07:14.947 --> 00:07:16.937
Others wanted stability.

00:07:17.477 --> 00:07:20.177
And many had spent their entire lives

00:07:20.477 --> 00:07:22.767
preparing for the possibility—just

00:07:22.937 --> 00:07:25.757
the slightest of possibilities—that

00:07:25.757 --> 00:07:28.307
they might one day rule.

00:07:29.437 --> 00:07:32.007
For the first time since the kingdom’s

00:07:32.007 --> 00:07:34.337
foundation, the question hanging in the

00:07:34.337 --> 00:07:38.477
air was not just who would be king next,

00:07:38.697 --> 00:07:41.497
but how that choice would even be made.

00:07:42.685 --> 00:07:45.865
And it was into this world—a world of

00:07:45.885 --> 00:07:49.045
vast wealth, complicated family politics,

00:07:49.285 --> 00:07:52.315
and an increasingly urgent need for a

00:07:52.315 --> 00:07:55.235
younger, more dynamic leadership—that

00:07:55.235 --> 00:07:58.725
we find Mohammed bin Salman, MBS.

00:07:59.625 --> 00:08:01.595
He wasn’t in the obvious

00:08:01.605 --> 00:08:02.665
line of succession.

00:08:03.185 --> 00:08:04.125
He wasn’t the eldest

00:08:04.125 --> 00:08:05.735
son of the eldest son.

00:08:06.385 --> 00:08:08.815
In fact, for much of his early

00:08:08.815 --> 00:08:11.495
life, he barely registered on the

00:08:11.495 --> 00:08:13.755
list of potential future kings.

00:08:14.715 --> 00:08:18.155
He was born in 1985, the sixth

00:08:18.255 --> 00:08:21.645
child of Salman bin Abdulaziz,

00:08:21.845 --> 00:08:24.935
a then 50-year-old senior prince

00:08:25.035 --> 00:08:27.375
who had served for decades as the

00:08:27.385 --> 00:08:30.075
governor of Riyadh, the capital city.

00:08:31.095 --> 00:08:34.725
His father was respected, serious,

00:08:35.175 --> 00:08:36.805
disciplined — a man with a

00:08:36.815 --> 00:08:39.885
reputation for hard work and order.

00:08:40.615 --> 00:08:43.515
But his father was only one of the

00:08:43.525 --> 00:08:48.095
almost 50 sons of Ibn Saud, and not at

00:08:48.125 --> 00:08:50.005
the very top of the succession list.

00:08:50.385 --> 00:08:52.855
It’s not clear exactly what

00:08:52.875 --> 00:08:55.365
number son he was, but it’s

00:08:55.365 --> 00:08:58.355
believed he was around number 25.

00:08:59.545 --> 00:09:04.435
So MBS, as the sixth son of a prince not

00:09:04.445 --> 00:09:06.745
expected to get anywhere near the throne,

00:09:07.185 --> 00:09:09.465
didn’t grow up expecting to be king.

00:09:10.235 --> 00:09:12.425
He wasn’t educated abroad,

00:09:12.525 --> 00:09:14.525
like many of his royal cousins.

00:09:14.935 --> 00:09:16.665
He didn’t spend his teenage years

00:09:16.935 --> 00:09:19.145
floating between luxury compounds

00:09:19.145 --> 00:09:21.065
in Europe or the United States.

00:09:21.745 --> 00:09:23.845
Instead, he stayed in Saudi

00:09:23.845 --> 00:09:26.635
Arabia, went to local schools,

00:09:26.785 --> 00:09:30.085
and lived a comparatively grounded

00:09:30.085 --> 00:09:32.575
life — well, grounded by the

00:09:32.585 --> 00:09:34.105
standards of a Saudi prince.

00:09:35.285 --> 00:09:38.145
According to a recent biography, as a

00:09:38.225 --> 00:09:41.415
teenager he showed little ambition or

00:09:41.675 --> 00:09:43.915
interest in climbing the royal ladder.

00:09:44.495 --> 00:09:46.495
He preferred video games and

00:09:46.495 --> 00:09:49.265
McDonald’s to business and politics.

00:09:49.905 --> 00:09:52.345
Whether something changed, or

00:09:52.615 --> 00:09:54.555
he was silently plotting from a

00:09:54.555 --> 00:09:56.665
very young age, we do not know.

00:09:57.365 --> 00:10:01.235
But sometime in his late teens, slowly

00:10:01.475 --> 00:10:05.125
but surely, he started to make his move.

00:10:06.065 --> 00:10:08.265
He cultivated connections with

00:10:08.425 --> 00:10:11.085
businessmen, security officials, and

00:10:11.095 --> 00:10:13.175
younger members of the royal family.

00:10:13.785 --> 00:10:16.075
He developed a reputation for being the

00:10:16.075 --> 00:10:19.145
prince who got things done, who followed

00:10:19.145 --> 00:10:22.165
up, who didn’t disappear into luxury or

00:10:22.395 --> 00:10:25.395
lose himself in excess, something of a

00:10:25.405 --> 00:10:27.865
rare trait for a young, Saudi prince.

00:10:28.615 --> 00:10:30.425
He developed a reputation for

00:10:30.435 --> 00:10:32.435
being serious, determined,

00:10:32.855 --> 00:10:35.165
and surprisingly focused.

00:10:36.145 --> 00:10:38.905
He studied law at King Saud University,

00:10:39.175 --> 00:10:41.505
graduating near the top of his class,

00:10:41.835 --> 00:10:44.205
and then began working informally

00:10:44.385 --> 00:10:46.545
as an adviser — first to his

00:10:46.545 --> 00:10:49.185
father, then to other senior royals.

00:10:50.225 --> 00:10:52.995
These weren’t glamorous roles.

00:10:53.135 --> 00:10:54.985
They were administrative,

00:10:55.195 --> 00:10:58.485
bureaucratic, and sometimes tedious.

00:10:59.125 --> 00:11:01.205
But they were important.

00:11:01.775 --> 00:11:03.535
They gave him insight into

00:11:03.535 --> 00:11:04.815
how decisions were made.

00:11:05.405 --> 00:11:06.955
Who held power.

00:11:07.225 --> 00:11:09.875
Who merely appeared to hold power.

00:11:10.475 --> 00:11:12.085
And where the weaknesses

00:11:12.255 --> 00:11:14.165
in the old system lay.

00:11:15.135 --> 00:11:17.255
And here’s an important detail.

00:11:17.775 --> 00:11:19.965
Saudi Arabia is an absolute

00:11:20.015 --> 00:11:21.735
monarchy; it doesn’t run on

00:11:22.065 --> 00:11:24.035
political parties and elections.

00:11:24.355 --> 00:11:27.935
It runs on networks, tribal networks,

00:11:28.095 --> 00:11:30.645
business networks, security networks,

00:11:30.985 --> 00:11:34.555
and all this underpinned by the sprawling

00:11:34.555 --> 00:11:37.075
network of the royal family itself.

00:11:37.725 --> 00:11:40.725
Knowing the right people — and being

00:11:40.755 --> 00:11:43.445
trusted by them — is one of the most

00:11:43.485 --> 00:11:45.825
powerful currencies in the country.

00:11:46.915 --> 00:11:50.035
MBS understood this instinctively.

00:11:50.865 --> 00:11:52.495
He also believed that his

00:11:52.535 --> 00:11:54.855
country needed to change.

00:11:55.565 --> 00:11:57.065
Around half the country

00:11:57.365 --> 00:11:59.445
is under the age of 30.

00:11:59.875 --> 00:12:03.165
Yet it was stuck in the past: ruled by

00:12:03.165 --> 00:12:07.055
men in their 70s and 80s, and beholden to

00:12:07.055 --> 00:12:09.555
conservative religious authorities that

00:12:09.555 --> 00:12:12.315
were given de facto power in the 1980s.

00:12:12.915 --> 00:12:15.185
Criminals were still publicly

00:12:15.185 --> 00:12:18.025
beheaded, women needed male guardian

00:12:18.025 --> 00:12:20.195
permission for many aspects of life,

00:12:20.495 --> 00:12:22.325
and they weren’t allowed to drive.

00:12:23.175 --> 00:12:26.655
Mohammed knew that something had to change

00:12:26.885 --> 00:12:29.585
for the country to modernise, but he must

00:12:29.585 --> 00:12:31.075
have thought that he would never have

00:12:31.075 --> 00:12:33.135
got the chance to have any say in it.

00:12:34.085 --> 00:12:38.495
This all changed in 2012, when his father,

00:12:38.805 --> 00:12:42.465
Salman, was appointed Crown Prince, in

00:12:42.465 --> 00:12:45.035
other words, next in line to the throne.

00:12:46.025 --> 00:12:49.595
And the then king, Abdullah, was rapidly

00:12:49.595 --> 00:12:52.735
approaching his 90th birthday, so this

00:12:52.745 --> 00:12:55.305
really was an imminent succession plan.

00:12:56.285 --> 00:12:58.965
Suddenly, MBS was one of the

00:12:58.975 --> 00:13:02.005
sons of the next King, and he

00:13:02.005 --> 00:13:04.375
began to position himself right

00:13:04.485 --> 00:13:06.645
at the heart of the royal court.

00:13:07.685 --> 00:13:10.609
Sure enough, in January, 2015,

00:13:10.895 --> 00:13:13.395
King Abdullah died, and the crown

00:13:13.695 --> 00:13:16.745
passed to Salman, MBS’s father.

00:13:17.625 --> 00:13:21.745
Now, Salman had other sons, but he made it

00:13:21.785 --> 00:13:24.505
pretty clear that MBS was his favourite.

00:13:25.225 --> 00:13:28.255
He immediately accelerated his son’s

00:13:28.255 --> 00:13:32.255
career, handing him two truly monumental

00:13:32.255 --> 00:13:34.495
positions that put him in control

00:13:34.655 --> 00:13:37.019
of both the money and the military:

00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:41.925
First, MBS was named Minister of Defence.

00:13:42.525 --> 00:13:45.045
At just 29 years old, he became

00:13:45.045 --> 00:13:46.785
the youngest defence minister

00:13:46.795 --> 00:13:49.395
in the world, and within months,

00:13:49.625 --> 00:13:51.285
he launched a controversial

00:13:51.475 --> 00:13:53.485
military intervention in Yemen.

00:13:54.425 --> 00:13:57.575
Second, and perhaps more importantly, he

00:13:57.575 --> 00:14:00.455
was appointed Chief of the Royal Court.

00:14:01.415 --> 00:14:03.355
This made him the King’s

00:14:03.595 --> 00:14:05.935
official gatekeeper, controlling

00:14:05.985 --> 00:14:07.575
all access to the monarch.

00:14:08.245 --> 00:14:11.315
If anyone in the sprawling royal family

00:14:11.315 --> 00:14:13.325
or the government wanted to speak to

00:14:13.325 --> 00:14:16.765
King Salman, they had to go through MBS.

00:14:17.675 --> 00:14:20.155
With this authority, he began

00:14:20.165 --> 00:14:22.855
his campaign to centralise power.

00:14:23.505 --> 00:14:26.265
He started pushing the ambitious economic

00:14:26.265 --> 00:14:29.465
and social reform plan known as Vision

00:14:29.555 --> 00:14:33.925
2030—a plan to remake Saudi society and

00:14:34.005 --> 00:14:36.595
end the kingdom's dependency on oil.

00:14:37.295 --> 00:14:40.575
By promoting this radical vision, he

00:14:40.575 --> 00:14:43.025
positioned himself as the moderniser

00:14:43.265 --> 00:14:45.605
and the champion of Saudi youth,

00:14:45.975 --> 00:14:47.835
earning huge popular support.

00:14:48.745 --> 00:14:52.475
But, and it is a big but, he still

00:14:52.485 --> 00:14:54.425
wasn’t crown prince; he wasn’t

00:14:54.555 --> 00:14:56.635
technically in line to the throne.

00:14:57.445 --> 00:15:00.315
This title went to an older cousin,

00:15:00.635 --> 00:15:04.265
Mohammed Bin Nayef, or MBN for short.

00:15:05.015 --> 00:15:08.415
Now, MBN was a serious figure.

00:15:08.985 --> 00:15:11.075
He was the Interior Minister, a

00:15:11.075 --> 00:15:14.525
known counter-terrorism expert, and a

00:15:14.535 --> 00:15:17.405
favoured long-time partner of Western

00:15:17.425 --> 00:15:20.425
intelligence agencies, including the CIA.

00:15:21.225 --> 00:15:23.435
He was the established choice to

00:15:23.435 --> 00:15:25.665
be the next king under the old

00:15:25.665 --> 00:15:27.945
system, a safe pair of hands.

00:15:29.055 --> 00:15:34.155
But in June 2017, King Salman

00:15:34.405 --> 00:15:36.255
made a shocking announcement.

00:15:37.216 --> 00:15:40.405
MBN was going to be removed

00:15:40.585 --> 00:15:43.955
from all duties, and MBS would

00:15:43.955 --> 00:15:46.235
replace him as Crown Prince.

00:15:46.965 --> 00:15:49.035
Power was officially moving

00:15:49.305 --> 00:15:53.265
vertically—from father to son—shattering

00:15:53.535 --> 00:15:56.105
the seven-decade-old tradition of

00:15:56.115 --> 00:15:59.245
horizontal, brother-to-brother succession.

00:16:00.585 --> 00:16:03.685
The transition was not exactly peaceful.

00:16:04.785 --> 00:16:08.375
Sources later revealed MBN was summoned

00:16:08.425 --> 00:16:12.045
to a royal palace late one night, held

00:16:12.315 --> 00:16:15.555
against his will, and pressured for hours

00:16:15.755 --> 00:16:18.715
to sign documents resigning his position.

00:16:19.955 --> 00:16:23.705
To show a facade of continuity, Saudi

00:16:23.715 --> 00:16:26.585
state television broadcast a clip of

00:16:26.585 --> 00:16:29.555
the newly appointed MBS kneeling to

00:16:29.555 --> 00:16:32.695
kiss the hand of the deposed heir, MBN.

00:16:33.442 --> 00:16:35.525
But the message was clear:

00:16:35.975 --> 00:16:38.225
the consensus era was over.

00:16:39.055 --> 00:16:41.885
MBS had engineered a quiet,

00:16:42.225 --> 00:16:43.715
behind-the-scenes coup,

00:16:44.185 --> 00:16:46.335
consolidating power in a manner

00:16:46.535 --> 00:16:48.885
unseen since the kingdom's founding.

00:16:50.075 --> 00:16:52.925
And this was only the beginning.

00:16:53.665 --> 00:16:55.655
The next step in securing his

00:16:55.745 --> 00:16:58.205
absolute dominance was even more

00:16:58.205 --> 00:17:00.905
shocking: a royal purge that turned

00:17:00.905 --> 00:17:03.055
one of the capital's most luxurious

00:17:03.155 --> 00:17:05.795
hotels into a gilded prison.

00:17:07.115 --> 00:17:09.239
On the night of November 4th,

00:17:09.515 --> 00:17:12.555
2017, something extraordinary

00:17:12.705 --> 00:17:13.685
happened in Riyadh.

00:17:14.525 --> 00:17:16.865
Without warning, dozens of the

00:17:16.875 --> 00:17:18.845
most powerful people in Saudi

00:17:18.845 --> 00:17:21.185
Arabia—princes, ministers,

00:17:21.505 --> 00:17:24.305
billionaires—received sudden orders

00:17:24.575 --> 00:17:27.075
to report to the Ritz-Carlton hotel.

00:17:28.225 --> 00:17:29.965
Some thought they were being

00:17:29.965 --> 00:17:31.955
invited to an urgent meeting.

00:17:32.465 --> 00:17:34.275
Others believed they were being

00:17:34.275 --> 00:17:36.565
summoned for an audience with the King.

00:17:37.385 --> 00:17:39.855
Instead, they walked into what

00:17:39.855 --> 00:17:41.785
was effectively the world’s

00:17:41.945 --> 00:17:44.285
most luxurious detention centre.

00:17:45.245 --> 00:17:48.055
The Ritz-Carlton was shut to the public.

00:17:48.435 --> 00:17:50.115
Its phone lines were cut.

00:17:50.115 --> 00:17:52.635
Security forces surrounded the grounds.

00:17:53.235 --> 00:17:56.985
And inside, some of the richest and

00:17:57.005 --> 00:17:59.715
most influential men in the entire

00:17:59.735 --> 00:18:01.735
Middle East were told they were

00:18:01.805 --> 00:18:04.225
under investigation for corruption.

00:18:05.235 --> 00:18:07.325
Among those detained was Prince

00:18:07.395 --> 00:18:09.695
Alwaleed bin Talal, the so-called

00:18:09.755 --> 00:18:12.165
Warren Buffet of Arabia, one of the

00:18:12.165 --> 00:18:14.785
most recognisable Saudi billionaires,

00:18:15.015 --> 00:18:17.455
a man with major shareholdings in

00:18:17.465 --> 00:18:19.625
big American technology companies.

00:18:20.285 --> 00:18:22.565
There were former ministers, media

00:18:22.565 --> 00:18:25.655
tycoons, heads of major companies, and

00:18:25.685 --> 00:18:28.125
even senior members of the military.

00:18:29.215 --> 00:18:32.705
In total, around 380 people were

00:18:32.705 --> 00:18:35.475
rounded up over the course of the purge.

00:18:36.315 --> 00:18:39.305
They were held not in cells, but in

00:18:39.305 --> 00:18:41.745
the ballroom and bedrooms of the Ritz,

00:18:42.005 --> 00:18:44.545
sleeping under gold chandeliers and

00:18:44.695 --> 00:18:47.565
ordering room service under armed guard.

00:18:48.375 --> 00:18:50.305
Officially, this was an

00:18:50.375 --> 00:18:51.855
anti-corruption campaign.

00:18:52.245 --> 00:18:54.465
Billions of dollars had been siphoned

00:18:54.465 --> 00:18:56.725
off through decades of patronage,

00:18:57.215 --> 00:18:59.945
contracts, and opaque deals, and

00:19:00.135 --> 00:19:03.525
the government–or rather, MBS–said

00:19:03.635 --> 00:19:06.015
it was time to clean up the system.

00:19:06.895 --> 00:19:09.465
But almost nobody believed

00:19:09.485 --> 00:19:10.825
the official explanation.

00:19:11.495 --> 00:19:13.955
This wasn’t simply about corruption.

00:19:14.485 --> 00:19:15.465
It was about power.

00:19:16.335 --> 00:19:18.435
By arresting some of the kingdom’s

00:19:18.645 --> 00:19:21.349
wealthiest and most connected figures,

00:19:21.835 --> 00:19:24.905
MBS was doing something unprecedented:

00:19:25.615 --> 00:19:27.585
He was removing every rival

00:19:27.775 --> 00:19:28.595
who could challenge him.

00:19:29.855 --> 00:19:30.535
And it worked.

00:19:31.335 --> 00:19:34.705
Within a few months, detainees agreed

00:19:34.765 --> 00:19:37.595
to hand over assets, property, or

00:19:37.595 --> 00:19:40.155
cash in exchange for their freedom.

00:19:41.415 --> 00:19:44.325
The Saudi state claimed to have recovered

00:19:44.535 --> 00:19:48.075
over 100 billion dollars’ worth of assets.

00:19:48.595 --> 00:19:51.015
But more importantly, Mohammed

00:19:51.025 --> 00:19:53.225
bin Salman emerged as the

00:19:53.315 --> 00:19:56.285
undisputed centre of authority.

00:19:57.125 --> 00:19:59.545
The message was unmistakable.

00:20:00.335 --> 00:20:02.825
If he could detain princes and

00:20:02.835 --> 00:20:05.055
billionaires at will, there

00:20:05.055 --> 00:20:06.905
was nobody he couldn’t touch.

00:20:07.905 --> 00:20:10.275
And while the purge at the Ritz-Carlton

00:20:10.455 --> 00:20:13.085
made headlines around the world, inside

00:20:13.085 --> 00:20:15.225
Saudi Arabia it did something else:

00:20:15.805 --> 00:20:18.365
It made MBS wildly popular

00:20:18.655 --> 00:20:19.865
among young Saudis.

00:20:20.785 --> 00:20:23.835
To many ordinary people, the old elite

00:20:24.045 --> 00:20:26.635
had lived above the law for decades.

00:20:27.445 --> 00:20:30.205
Suddenly, a young prince was taking them

00:20:30.205 --> 00:20:33.995
on—publicly, decisively, dramatically.

00:20:34.985 --> 00:20:37.565
It felt like a revolution, but

00:20:37.855 --> 00:20:40.355
a revolution led from the top.

00:20:41.575 --> 00:20:43.445
But popularity at home

00:20:43.745 --> 00:20:45.335
was only half the battle.

00:20:45.955 --> 00:20:49.205
MBS knew that to truly transform Saudi

00:20:49.205 --> 00:20:51.945
Arabia, he needed to change how the

00:20:51.945 --> 00:20:54.375
rest of the world saw his country.

00:20:55.145 --> 00:20:57.515
And that meant tackling the kingdom's

00:20:57.545 --> 00:21:00.035
greatest vulnerability: oil.

00:21:00.825 --> 00:21:03.315
For decades, Saudi Arabia had

00:21:03.315 --> 00:21:05.625
been defined by a single resource.

00:21:06.115 --> 00:21:08.545
Oil paid for everything—the

00:21:08.545 --> 00:21:10.535
palaces, the welfare state, the

00:21:10.535 --> 00:21:12.805
military, the sprawling bureaucracy.

00:21:13.335 --> 00:21:17.555
But oil prices were volatile, and MBS

00:21:17.555 --> 00:21:19.685
could see that the world was slowly

00:21:19.685 --> 00:21:22.115
turning toward renewable energy.

00:21:23.145 --> 00:21:25.855
He wanted to wean the country off its

00:21:25.865 --> 00:21:28.815
reliance on oil before it was too late.

00:21:29.645 --> 00:21:31.625
He wanted to reshape the country’s

00:21:31.655 --> 00:21:34.325
entire economy, its international

00:21:34.325 --> 00:21:36.735
relationships, and—perhaps most

00:21:36.735 --> 00:21:38.985
ambitiously—its global image.

00:21:39.595 --> 00:21:42.055
He wanted Silicon Valley, Wall Street,

00:21:42.375 --> 00:21:46.165
and the world to see Saudi Arabia not as

00:21:46.165 --> 00:21:49.705
an oil state stuck in the past… but as

00:21:49.705 --> 00:21:52.625
the next great frontier for innovation.

00:21:53.465 --> 00:21:55.755
He created a huge sovereign wealth

00:21:55.755 --> 00:21:58.695
fund, committing tens of billions of

00:21:58.695 --> 00:22:00.955
dollars to be invested in technology

00:22:00.955 --> 00:22:03.385
startups, pouring money into companies

00:22:03.625 --> 00:22:07.455
like Uber, Slack, WeWork, and DoorDash.

00:22:08.385 --> 00:22:10.255
In just a matter of a few years,

00:22:10.565 --> 00:22:13.055
Saudi Arabia wasn’t just buying

00:22:13.055 --> 00:22:15.545
football teams or luxury hotels.

00:22:15.855 --> 00:22:18.345
It was sitting right at the table

00:22:18.415 --> 00:22:20.685
of global tech’s biggest bets.

00:22:21.725 --> 00:22:23.382
And it didn’t stop there.

00:22:24.038 --> 00:22:26.855
MBS struck personal relationships

00:22:26.985 --> 00:22:29.435
with world leaders, including Donald

00:22:29.435 --> 00:22:33.135
Trump, who visited Riyadh in 2017 on

00:22:33.135 --> 00:22:35.535
his first foreign trip as president.

00:22:36.405 --> 00:22:39.335
Trump and his administration warmly

00:22:39.335 --> 00:22:41.355
embraced the young crown prince,

00:22:41.505 --> 00:22:43.985
announcing major arms deals, praising

00:22:43.995 --> 00:22:46.605
his reforms, and offering the kind

00:22:46.605 --> 00:22:49.175
of diplomatic support MBS needed

00:22:49.425 --> 00:22:51.595
as he consolidated power at home.

00:22:52.485 --> 00:22:55.255
For the first time ever, it seemed as

00:22:55.255 --> 00:22:58.465
though Saudi Arabia was on the cusp of

00:22:58.465 --> 00:23:01.795
reinventing itself entirely—modernising

00:23:01.815 --> 00:23:05.085
socially, diversifying economically, and

00:23:05.295 --> 00:23:08.105
becoming a hub for futuristic projects.

00:23:08.965 --> 00:23:12.045
And perhaps the boldest of all these

00:23:12.055 --> 00:23:14.425
projects was one we’ll be talking about

00:23:14.425 --> 00:23:17.165
in part two of this mini-series: a new

00:23:17.165 --> 00:23:20.665
city in the desert, 170 kilometres long,

00:23:21.035 --> 00:23:24.315
built in a straight line, powered entirely

00:23:24.315 --> 00:23:26.775
by clean energy, and designed as a kind

00:23:26.775 --> 00:23:30.275
of techno-utopia for the 21st century.

00:23:30.765 --> 00:23:32.172
A place called NEOM.

00:23:33.195 --> 00:23:36.575
But alongside this glossy vision

00:23:36.595 --> 00:23:38.175
of the future, there was a

00:23:38.185 --> 00:23:40.945
much darker side to MBS’s rule.

00:23:41.705 --> 00:23:43.985
Because while foreign investors

00:23:43.985 --> 00:23:46.315
were flying in, and global leaders

00:23:46.425 --> 00:23:48.965
were shaking hands, opponents of

00:23:48.965 --> 00:23:51.685
the government—activists, critics,

00:23:52.085 --> 00:23:54.875
journalists—they were increasingly being

00:23:54.905 --> 00:23:58.172
targeted inside Saudi Arabia and abroad.

00:23:58.842 --> 00:24:01.552
Women’s rights campaigners were arrested.

00:24:01.882 --> 00:24:03.842
Rival princes who had not been

00:24:03.842 --> 00:24:05.629
caught up in the Ritz-Carlton purge

00:24:06.112 --> 00:24:08.232
suddenly found themselves silenced.

00:24:08.742 --> 00:24:11.172
Even tweets, at times, became

00:24:11.172 --> 00:24:12.882
grounds for imprisonment.

00:24:14.312 --> 00:24:17.742
And in 2018, the world witnessed

00:24:17.742 --> 00:24:20.762
something so shocking, so brutal,

00:24:21.152 --> 00:24:22.912
that it permanently changed the

00:24:22.932 --> 00:24:25.052
international perception of Mohammed

00:24:25.052 --> 00:24:27.752
bin Salman: the gruesome murder of

00:24:27.752 --> 00:24:30.632
the journalist Jamal Khashoggi inside

00:24:30.662 --> 00:24:33.122
the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.

00:24:33.962 --> 00:24:36.492
Now, we’ll be going into this in much

00:24:36.492 --> 00:24:39.612
more detail in part three, but in short,

00:24:39.982 --> 00:24:42.862
this well-known Saudi journalist went

00:24:42.932 --> 00:24:45.729
into the consulate, was murdered and

00:24:45.729 --> 00:24:47.892
then chopped to pieces with a bone saw.

00:24:48.712 --> 00:24:51.962
Although this was first denied by Saudi

00:24:51.962 --> 00:24:54.822
authorities, the official policy line is

00:24:54.822 --> 00:24:57.602
that it was carried out by rogue state

00:24:57.622 --> 00:25:00.652
actors, without the knowledge of MBS.

00:25:01.972 --> 00:25:04.952
And for a brief period after this

00:25:05.012 --> 00:25:07.462
shocking discovery, it looked like it

00:25:07.462 --> 00:25:09.812
would be hard for MBS to come back.

00:25:10.572 --> 00:25:12.902
Businessmen who had once been happy

00:25:13.082 --> 00:25:15.612
to be photographed beside him declined

00:25:15.632 --> 00:25:18.252
meetings, investors pulled out of

00:25:18.262 --> 00:25:20.792
the country, and newspaper columns

00:25:20.932 --> 00:25:23.152
were filled with damning reports.

00:25:23.972 --> 00:25:28.002
But time and money were on his side.

00:25:28.772 --> 00:25:31.062
And, sure enough, investors,

00:25:31.422 --> 00:25:33.992
politicians, and celebrities didn’t

00:25:34.052 --> 00:25:36.412
take too long to change their tune.

00:25:37.142 --> 00:25:39.262
Saudi Arabia’s enormous wealth,

00:25:39.372 --> 00:25:42.282
its strategic importance, and its

00:25:42.322 --> 00:25:44.852
ambitious plans for the future proved

00:25:44.962 --> 00:25:47.262
too attractive for many to ignore.

00:25:48.312 --> 00:25:51.502
Global CEOs quietly flew back to Riyadh.

00:25:51.892 --> 00:25:54.482
Tech investors resumed their courtship.

00:25:54.852 --> 00:25:56.642
Hollywood stars returned

00:25:56.652 --> 00:25:57.932
for glitzy events.

00:25:58.292 --> 00:26:00.672
And governments—publicly or

00:26:00.672 --> 00:26:03.112
privately—re-engaged with the kingdom.

00:26:04.142 --> 00:26:07.262
Within 18 months, MBS was hosting

00:26:07.262 --> 00:26:10.512
the G20 summit in Riyadh, where world

00:26:10.512 --> 00:26:12.992
leaders—including those who'd publicly

00:26:12.992 --> 00:26:15.872
condemned him—stood side by side with

00:26:15.872 --> 00:26:18.102
the crown prince for official photos.

00:26:19.152 --> 00:26:21.612
And that brings us to today.

00:26:22.422 --> 00:26:24.592
As of the time of recording this episode,

00:26:25.052 --> 00:26:27.942
his father, the 90-year-old King Salman,

00:26:28.252 --> 00:26:30.692
is still nominally on the throne.

00:26:31.612 --> 00:26:34.142
Today, Mohammed bin Salman is not

00:26:34.152 --> 00:26:36.262
just the Crown Prince; he is the

00:26:36.272 --> 00:26:38.912
de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia.

00:26:39.772 --> 00:26:42.542
When he becomes king, and perhaps he

00:26:42.592 --> 00:26:44.312
already will be by the time you listen

00:26:44.312 --> 00:26:47.412
to this, it will merely be a formality.

00:26:47.992 --> 00:26:50.392
He already oversees everything from

00:26:50.432 --> 00:26:53.152
oil strategy to social reforms, from

00:26:53.282 --> 00:26:55.452
foreign policy to football clubs.

00:26:56.202 --> 00:26:58.382
He has relaxed some long-standing

00:26:58.392 --> 00:27:02.062
restrictions—women can now drive, cinemas

00:27:02.312 --> 00:27:04.992
have reopened, concerts are allowed,

00:27:05.272 --> 00:27:07.442
and the infamous secret police have

00:27:07.442 --> 00:27:09.652
been stripped of much of their power.

00:27:10.662 --> 00:27:13.712
For young Saudis who grew up unable to

00:27:13.712 --> 00:27:16.812
go to a cinema, or lived in fear of being

00:27:16.822 --> 00:27:18.892
stopped on the street by the religious

00:27:18.922 --> 00:27:22.532
police, these changes felt revolutionary.

00:27:23.262 --> 00:27:26.732
Yet the darker sides of his rule remain

00:27:27.022 --> 00:27:30.122
impossible to ignore: the silencing of

00:27:30.122 --> 00:27:32.762
critics, the imprisonment of activists,

00:27:32.852 --> 00:27:35.852
the ongoing humanitarian crisis in

00:27:35.852 --> 00:27:38.682
Yemen, and the unresolved questions

00:27:38.892 --> 00:27:41.146
around the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.

00:27:42.305 --> 00:27:46.652
To some, MBS is a visionary moderniser.

00:27:46.682 --> 00:27:49.592
To others, a ruthless authoritarian.

00:27:50.462 --> 00:27:52.332
To many, he is both.

00:27:53.152 --> 00:27:55.712
He is only 40 years old, and in

00:27:55.762 --> 00:27:57.882
all likelihood will look forward

00:27:58.082 --> 00:28:00.572
to the best part of 50 years

00:28:00.772 --> 00:28:02.462
on the throne of Saudi Arabia.

00:28:02.982 --> 00:28:05.672
What is certain is that he

00:28:05.672 --> 00:28:08.062
is someone you cannot ignore.

00:28:09.482 --> 00:28:11.372
OK, then, that is it for today's

00:28:11.372 --> 00:28:13.445
episode on Mohammed Bin Salman.

00:28:13.802 --> 00:28:15.442
As always, I would love to know

00:28:15.442 --> 00:28:16.702
what you thought of this episode.

00:28:16.962 --> 00:28:18.872
We have lots of listeners from Saudi

00:28:18.872 --> 00:28:21.192
Arabia, so let me know what you think?

00:28:21.402 --> 00:28:23.862
How has MBS changed the country, and

00:28:23.862 --> 00:28:26.072
what hopes do you have for the future?

00:28:26.332 --> 00:28:27.342
You can head right into our

00:28:27.342 --> 00:28:28.902

chatting away to other curious minds.

00:28:34.062 --> 00:28:36.572
And as a final reminder, this is

00:28:36.572 --> 00:28:39.142
part one of a three-part mini-series.

00:28:39.372 --> 00:28:41.872
Next up, in part two, we’ll be looking at

00:28:41.882 --> 00:28:44.982
the astronomically ambitious and expensive

00:28:45.012 --> 00:28:48.232
project of NEOM, and in part three it’ll

00:28:48.262 --> 00:28:51.032
be the gruesome murder of Jamal Khashoggi.

00:28:51.572 --> 00:28:53.352
You've been listening to English Learning

00:28:53.352 --> 00:28:56.072

I'll catch you in the next episode.
