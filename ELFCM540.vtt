Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:16.040
English, the show where you can listen to fascinating stories and learn weird

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:20.479
and wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:27.734
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is the start of another three-part mini-series, this time

00:00:28.004 --> 00:00:34.044
on the very loose theme of the fall of the Ottoman Empire and the birth of modern Turkey.

00:00:34.614 --> 00:00:40.514
In part one, today’s episode, we are going to talk about probably the most requested subject

00:00:40.694 --> 00:00:46.994
in the history of this show: the life of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the father of modern Turkey.

00:00:47.624 --> 00:00:52.664
In part two, we are going to talk about the life of a very different and

00:00:52.674 --> 00:00:57.602
less well-known figure, Ali Pasha – The so-called “Lion of Ioannina”.

00:00:58.303 --> 00:01:03.263
And in part three, we will turn to Cyprus, the Mediterranean island split

00:01:03.283 --> 00:01:08.393
in two, and home to one of Europe’s last great unresolved conflicts.

00:01:08.943 --> 00:01:14.743
Right then, let’s get right into it, and talk about the father of modern Turkey.

00:01:16.673 --> 00:01:24.666
On the 15th of October, 1927, the then President of Turkey stood up to give a speech.

00:01:25.576 --> 00:01:30.306
To say it was “not short” would be something of an understatement.

00:01:31.186 --> 00:01:37.526
It took him 36 hours to finish, and was broken up over six days.

00:01:38.416 --> 00:01:43.866
It was called Nutuk, or “The Speech”, in English, and it has become

00:01:43.876 --> 00:01:47.976
one of the most important historical documents in Turkish history.

00:01:49.146 --> 00:01:53.456
Now, you might think, “well, Turkey, or at least the geographical

00:01:53.476 --> 00:01:57.096
area of Turkey, does have a long and storied history.

00:01:57.436 --> 00:02:01.546
The Persians, the founding of Constantinople, the eastern Roman

00:02:01.546 --> 00:02:05.716
Empire, then the Byzantine Empire, the Ottoman Empire, and so on.

00:02:05.942 --> 00:02:09.282
There’s a lot to get through, so no wonder it took him so long!”

00:02:10.262 --> 00:02:15.962
In fact, he didn’t talk about any of this, at least, not in any real detail.

00:02:16.942 --> 00:02:24.279
The history of Turkey, as per this speech, started on the 19th of May, 1919.

00:02:25.802 --> 00:02:31.242
This is the date when the speaker, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, landed at

00:02:31.242 --> 00:02:36.432
the town of Samsun, a port town on the southern side of The Black Sea.

00:02:37.622 --> 00:02:45.012
The speech went on, and in it Atatürk presented the situation Turkey found itself in at that time.

00:02:45.862 --> 00:02:51.242
Or rather, the situation in which the country we now know as Turkey found itself.

00:02:52.432 --> 00:02:56.912
The modern Republic of Turkey was, at that time, part of the Ottoman

00:02:56.912 --> 00:03:02.312
Empire—the vast, multi-ethnic empire that had ruled large parts of the

00:03:02.312 --> 00:03:07.482
Middle East, North Africa, and southeastern Europe for over six centuries.

00:03:08.552 --> 00:03:16.712
At its peak, in the late 17th century, it ruled over 5.2 million kilometres squared, covering

00:03:16.922 --> 00:03:23.312
much of modern Greece and the Balkan area, Syria, Iraq, Israel, Lebanon, and North Africa.

00:03:23.872 --> 00:03:29.849
It was a gigantic territory, greater even than the Roman Empire at its height.

00:03:30.422 --> 00:03:33.982
For hundreds of years, it had been one of the most powerful

00:03:34.002 --> 00:03:39.012
empires in the world, feared by European kings and emperors alike.

00:03:39.422 --> 00:03:44.352
Its armies had marched as far as Vienna, its navy controlled the Mediterranean,

00:03:44.662 --> 00:03:50.652
and its capital, Constantinople, was a city of immense wealth and influence.

00:03:51.542 --> 00:03:59.142
But it had past its peak, and by the late 19th century, the empire was in deep decline.

00:04:00.092 --> 00:04:04.022
European diplomats and commentators had been watching its decline

00:04:04.042 --> 00:04:09.272
for decades, and had taken to calling it “the sick man of Europe”.

00:04:10.322 --> 00:04:15.372
Now, we’ll get into how it eventually collapsed in a minute, but first

00:04:15.552 --> 00:04:19.842
its worth briefly touching on some of the reasons for the decline of

00:04:19.852 --> 00:04:24.416
the Ottoman Empire, because they help explain the rise of Atatürk.

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:30.092
Firstly, as is often the case with great empires, corruption

00:04:30.292 --> 00:04:33.512
and mismanagement had weakened the empire from within.

00:04:34.462 --> 00:04:39.452
Secondly, a series of military defeats had stripped it of territory.

00:04:40.422 --> 00:04:46.892
And thirdly, it was just too large and had too many competing different ethnic and

00:04:46.892 --> 00:04:52.552
religious groups—the Arabs, the Greeks, the Armenians, and the Slavs, to name but a few.

00:04:53.312 --> 00:04:59.419
This was an era of nationalist movements, and, perfectly reasonably you might argue,

00:04:59.769 --> 00:05:05.979
these groups wanted a country to call their own, they didn’t want to just be subsumed,

00:05:06.239 --> 00:05:11.349
swallowed up, by an empire to which they didn’t feel a strong sense of allegiance.

00:05:12.589 --> 00:05:15.209
Then came the First World War.

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:20.679
It was bad news for everyone, but particularly bad news for the

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:24.799
Ottoman Empire, which by this time was no longer ruled by a strong

00:05:24.799 --> 00:05:30.449
sultan but by a group of military leaders known as the ‘Three Pashas.’

00:05:31.839 --> 00:05:36.499
These men led the empire into World War I, making the

00:05:36.499 --> 00:05:40.709
fateful decision to side with Germany and Austria-Hungary.

00:05:41.429 --> 00:05:46.819
It was a disastrous decision, the nail in the coffin for the sick man of Europe.

00:05:47.739 --> 00:05:51.449
The Ottomans lost battles on multiple fronts, from the

00:05:51.459 --> 00:05:54.239
deserts of Arabia to the mountains of the Caucasus.

00:05:54.519 --> 00:06:00.759
Hundreds of thousands of soldiers were killed, an estimated 1.5% of the population.

00:06:02.019 --> 00:06:08.269
By the time the war ended in 1918, the Ottoman Empire was effectively finished.

00:06:09.429 --> 00:06:14.559
And if that wasn’t bad enough, its enemies—the victorious Allied

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:19.522
powers of Britain, France, and Italy—were now circling like vultures.

00:06:20.329 --> 00:06:26.689
They had won the war, and they planned to carve up the Ottoman Empire among themselves.

00:06:27.869 --> 00:06:30.919
And they did, or at least, they tried to.

00:06:32.059 --> 00:06:36.489
Under the terms of the Treaty of Sèvres, which was signed in 1920,

00:06:36.989 --> 00:06:41.609
huge parts of the Ottoman Empire were handed over to foreign powers.

00:06:42.217 --> 00:06:49.485
Greece occupied the western region of Anatolia, of modern-day Turkey, while Italy took the south.

00:06:50.135 --> 00:06:53.635
The British controlled Mesopotamia and Palestine.

00:06:54.095 --> 00:06:56.765
The French took Syria and Lebanon.

00:06:57.555 --> 00:07:01.512
Even the Ottoman capital, Constantinople, or Istanbul

00:07:01.692 --> 00:07:04.694
as it's now called, was occupied by Allied troops.

00:07:05.434 --> 00:07:10.884
The Ottoman Empire was already seriously down from its peak, having gone from over

00:07:10.894 --> 00:07:16.374
5 million kilometres squared to 1.6 million on the eve of the First World War.

00:07:17.544 --> 00:07:22.574
And after the Treaty of Sèvres, it was left with a chunk of land in the middle

00:07:22.574 --> 00:07:28.641
of Anatolia, less than 500,000 kilometres squared, around the size of Sweden.

00:07:29.511 --> 00:07:34.651
To many, it seemed as though Turkey would soon be reduced to nothing more

00:07:34.761 --> 00:07:40.631
than a rump state—a tiny, powerless remnant of the once-great empire.

00:07:41.561 --> 00:07:46.041
So, enter stage right, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk.

00:07:46.931 --> 00:07:52.591
Before we get into exactly what he did, let me tell you a little about his early life,

00:07:53.021 --> 00:07:59.011
as this also helps you get a taste for quite how multi-ethnic the region was, how

00:07:59.231 --> 00:08:04.941
over the years its various towns and cities have switched allegiances, and even names.

00:08:06.031 --> 00:08:13.731
Atatürk was born in 1881 in the city of Salonica, which at the time was part of the

00:08:13.761 --> 00:08:20.091
Ottoman Empire, but today is in Greece, and it has a different name: Thessaloniki.

00:08:21.381 --> 00:08:26.001
Mustafa Kemal Atatürk was not his real name, at least at birth.

00:08:26.651 --> 00:08:31.561
Both Kemal and Atatürk came after, for reasons we’ll get to in a minute.

00:08:32.371 --> 00:08:35.891
The only name he came into the world with was Mustafa.

00:08:36.981 --> 00:08:40.081
If this sounds unusual, it wasn’t.

00:08:40.391 --> 00:08:46.141
It was fairly customary in the Ottoman Empire for children not to be given a surname, as they

00:08:46.141 --> 00:08:51.911
would typically acquire other names, other ways of identifying themselves, later on in life.

00:08:53.061 --> 00:08:57.581
In terms of his parents, he came from a modest background; his

00:08:57.581 --> 00:09:02.501
father was a customs officer, and his mother was a devout Muslim.

00:09:03.371 --> 00:09:07.428
His mother reportedly pushed for the young boy to have a religious

00:09:07.478 --> 00:09:12.938
education, to be schooled in a madras, but he went down a different path.

00:09:14.228 --> 00:09:18.488
After his father died, when the boy was only 7 years old, he

00:09:18.488 --> 00:09:22.258
convinced his mother to let him enrol in a military school.

00:09:23.538 --> 00:09:30.518
And it was there that he got the name “Kemal”, which means “perfection” or “maturity” in Turkish.

00:09:31.128 --> 00:09:35.528
His maths teacher, so the legend goes, was so impressed by his

00:09:35.528 --> 00:09:38.998
intelligence and discipline that he gave him this nickname.

00:09:39.838 --> 00:09:46.028
And it was there, in military school, that he became fascinated with the idea of change.

00:09:46.838 --> 00:09:52.498
This was at a time when it was patently clear to anyone, from the Sultan to the

00:09:52.548 --> 00:09:58.458
teenage boy at military school, that the Ottoman Empire was already in deep decline.

00:09:59.178 --> 00:10:00.818
The empire was losing territory.

00:10:01.118 --> 00:10:04.158
European powers were dominating world politics.

00:10:04.898 --> 00:10:09.718
Many young officers, including Mustafa Kemal, started to realise that

00:10:09.768 --> 00:10:15.878
the Ottoman system was outdated, corrupt, and incapable of modernising.

00:10:17.338 --> 00:10:25.635
And it wasn’t just a realisation that these young men had, but a desire to do something about it.

00:10:26.441 --> 00:10:30.148
Mustafa Kemal became part of a new generation of military

00:10:30.148 --> 00:10:35.248
leaders who wanted to reform, reshape, and modernise the country.

00:10:36.718 --> 00:10:41.118
After graduating, and with plenty of opportunities to hone

00:10:41.128 --> 00:10:44.628
his military chops, he quickly rose through the ranks.

00:10:45.068 --> 00:10:51.647
He fought in Libya against the Italians, in the Italo-Turkish war of 1911 and 1912.

00:10:52.478 --> 00:10:56.328
Then when war broke out in the Balkans, he went there.

00:10:57.298 --> 00:11:00.148
Everywhere he went, he distinguished himself.

00:11:00.699 --> 00:11:05.117
He was young, but he was clearly a capable military leader.

00:11:06.437 --> 00:11:12.257
And then, in 1915, came the moment that would make him famous: Gallipoli.

00:11:13.447 --> 00:11:18.137
A year into World War One, in a bid to defeat the Ottoman Empire, seize

00:11:18.137 --> 00:11:22.817
control of the Dardanelles Strait, and open up a vital supply route to Russia,

00:11:23.557 --> 00:11:29.077
British and French forces launched an ambitious naval and land invasion.

00:11:30.277 --> 00:11:34.287
Their target was Gallipoli, in the Eastern Mediterranean, which

00:11:34.287 --> 00:11:38.867
was guarded by the poorly equipped and under-prepared Ottoman Army.

00:11:40.257 --> 00:11:45.367
Strategically, this mission made a lot of sense, and the British and

00:11:45.367 --> 00:11:48.804
French forces, two of the strongest military forces in the world,

00:11:49.274 --> 00:11:53.304
anticipated moving through the peninsula with minimal resistance.

00:11:54.504 --> 00:11:57.374
They grossly misjudged their opponents.

00:11:58.194 --> 00:12:02.444
After eight months of bloody fighting, with an estimated quarter of a

00:12:02.444 --> 00:12:07.987
million casualties on each side, the French and the British troops retreated.

00:12:09.157 --> 00:12:12.547
Against all odds, the Ottomans won.

00:12:13.641 --> 00:12:20.682
And Mustafa Kemal, then only 34 years old, was one of the key commanders of this historic victory.

00:12:21.782 --> 00:12:25.802
It was during this battle that he gave one of his most famous orders to

00:12:25.802 --> 00:12:30.962
his men, an order that would go down in history as defining his character.

00:12:32.082 --> 00:12:36.832
“I do not order you to attack,” he said, “I order you to die.”

00:12:38.312 --> 00:12:43.960
But while Gallipoli made him a hero, and provided plenty of soundbites

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:48.412
to use later, it did not change the fate of the Ottoman Empire.

00:12:49.252 --> 00:12:56.282
The empire was still on the losing side of the war, and by 1918, it was collapsing.

00:12:56.892 --> 00:12:58.792
The Sultan was powerless.

00:12:59.162 --> 00:13:01.652
Allied forces occupied Istanbul.

00:13:02.082 --> 00:13:07.362
And the country that had once been feared and respected was on the chopping board,

00:13:07.702 --> 00:13:12.342
ready to be devoured by foreign enemies and powerless to do anything about it.

00:13:13.722 --> 00:13:19.232
Now, it makes for a much better story to say that there was only one man who stood

00:13:19.232 --> 00:13:25.622
against all of this, and, were it not for Mustafa Kemal, Turkey would not exist.

00:13:26.665 --> 00:13:31.282
The reality seems to be that there were many other decorated generals and

00:13:31.282 --> 00:13:36.416
military leaders who were keen to stand up to the foreign powers, and had

00:13:36.416 --> 00:13:40.326
it not been Mustafa Kemal, it would most likely have been someone else.

00:13:40.846 --> 00:13:46.836
But history is full of what-ifs, and in the case of Turkey, it was not

00:13:46.876 --> 00:13:51.306
another general but Mustafa Kemal that would change the course of history.

00:13:52.469 --> 00:13:57.229
So, we are now at the starting point of Nutuk, the date at which

00:13:57.449 --> 00:14:01.999
Mustafa Kemal Atatürk begins the story of the Republic of Turkey.

00:14:03.069 --> 00:14:08.269
In May 1919, he boarded a ship and set sail for the

00:14:08.269 --> 00:14:12.709
northern coast of Anatolia, to the Black Sea port of Samsun.

00:14:13.964 --> 00:14:19.884
When Mustafa Kemal arrived in Samsun on the 19th of May, 1919, he

00:14:19.884 --> 00:14:24.324
was still, officially at least, an officer in the Ottoman army.

00:14:25.344 --> 00:14:31.904
But in reality, he had already begun to set himself on a very different path.

00:14:33.214 --> 00:14:39.110
He had been sent to Samsun by the Sultan’s government under the pretext of restoring order in

00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:45.660
Anatolia, but he had no intention of following orders from central command back in Istanbul.

00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:52.620
Instead, he was about to launch what would become the Turkish War of Independence.

00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:58.100
Now, this war went on for four years, and it warrants

00:14:58.150 --> 00:15:01.270
much more than just a passing mention in an episode.

00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:05.650
But, in short, the Greeks, the French, the British and the

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:10.060
Armenians were all pushing into Anatolia from different directions.

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:15.890
The Ottoman government and the Ottoman ruler, the Sultan, were doing little to intervene.

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:20.080
To many, it seemed as though the country was finished.

00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:23.430
The Ottoman Empire had just lost a world war.

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:25.100
The Allies were in control.

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:29.950
And there in the middle was a fledgling Turkish nationalist

00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:34.930
movement led by a quite popular but not universally known general.

00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:39.480
How could a group of rebels, with limited weapons and

00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:42.590
no international support, stand a fighting chance?

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:49.480
To cut a long story short, over the next three years, Mustafa

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:54.090
Kemal turned a fragmented resistance into a disciplined army.

00:15:55.120 --> 00:16:02.240
He lured the Greeks inland, far away from their supply lines, and won a series of decisive battles.

00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:08.200
Now, you’ve heard that he went to military school and had spent practically his entire

00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:14.980
life in the army, but it’s hard to overstate quite how capable a military leader he was.

00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:21.890
He was fearless on the battleground, had been injured multiple times, and had the scars to prove it.

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:27.360
He was demanding to his soldiers, famously telling them that he expected

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:31.290
them to die for their country at Gallipoli, and proclaiming that he

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:36.080
would see the creation of a Turkish state, or he would die trying.

00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:43.110
All accounts point to a charismatic and brave leader; this was not a man

00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:48.050
who sat back at headquarters and moved around pretend soldiers on a map,

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:53.750
this was a decorated, respected and highly effective military leader.

00:16:54.780 --> 00:17:01.140
Now, fast forward to 1922, and against all the odds, the Turkish nationalists

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:06.349
had pushed the foreign forces practically all the way out of Anatolia, and

00:17:06.559 --> 00:17:11.529
the Greek army was forced into a chaotic retreat towards the Aegean coast.

00:17:12.299 --> 00:17:18.939
The Turkish forces entered the coastal city of İzmir, and the war was effectively over.

00:17:19.629 --> 00:17:22.919
One by one, the occupying powers withdrew.

00:17:23.959 --> 00:17:29.099
The British, who were unwilling to risk another conflict, decided to negotiate.

00:17:29.869 --> 00:17:34.501
The result was The Treaty of Lausanne, which was signed in 1923.

00:17:34.939 --> 00:17:39.629
It replaced the humiliating Treaty of Sèvres and declared that

00:17:39.629 --> 00:17:43.909
it would recognise the independence of a new Republic of Turkey.

00:17:44.849 --> 00:17:48.789
Mustafa Kemal had done what seemed impossible.

00:17:49.729 --> 00:17:52.769
He had not only defeated the foreign occupiers, but

00:17:53.079 --> 00:17:56.789
he had also dismantled the Ottoman system itself.

00:17:57.929 --> 00:18:04.499
A few months later, on the 29th of October 1923, he declared the establishment of

00:18:04.499 --> 00:18:09.844
the Republic of Turkey, the Republic of Türkiye, to give it its correct modern name.

00:18:11.094 --> 00:18:14.104
Naturally, he would be its first president.

00:18:14.884 --> 00:18:18.484
The Sultan, whose family had ruled the Ottoman Empire

00:18:18.494 --> 00:18:23.984
for 623 years, was deposed and sent into exile.

00:18:24.674 --> 00:18:30.644
The Ottoman Empire, once one of the most powerful empires in the world, was no more.

00:18:31.694 --> 00:18:34.324
But Mustafa Kemal was not finished.

00:18:34.514 --> 00:18:39.204
The war was over, but now came the real challenge—building

00:18:39.214 --> 00:18:42.644
a modern nation from the ashes of an empire.

00:18:44.004 --> 00:18:49.264
He had fought for Turkey’s independence, but now he would fight for its transformation.

00:18:50.244 --> 00:18:53.594
In his mind, independence was not enough.

00:18:54.134 --> 00:18:58.634
To truly survive in the modern world, Turkey had to change.

00:18:59.114 --> 00:19:01.054
And it had to change fast.

00:19:01.864 --> 00:19:03.254
He wasted no time.

00:19:03.744 --> 00:19:07.214
Almost immediately, sweeping reforms began.

00:19:08.234 --> 00:19:11.554
And this wasn’t just about political structures.

00:19:11.814 --> 00:19:17.244
It was about language, education, religion, culture, and the

00:19:17.244 --> 00:19:21.464
very way people saw themselves as citizens of a new republic.

00:19:22.494 --> 00:19:29.475
One of the first and most radical changes was the abolition of the Caliphate in 1924.

00:19:30.253 --> 00:19:34.703
For centuries, the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire had not just been a

00:19:34.723 --> 00:19:39.293
political ruler but also the spiritual leader of the Muslim world.

00:19:40.023 --> 00:19:47.033
Many expected that even if the empire had collapsed, Turkey would retain this religious authority.

00:19:47.743 --> 00:19:50.763
But Mustafa Kemal had other ideas.

00:19:51.313 --> 00:19:55.213
He wanted Turkey to be a secular state, one where

00:19:55.213 --> 00:19:59.023
religious institutions had no influence over politics.

00:19:59.943 --> 00:20:01.553
This was shocking.

00:20:02.153 --> 00:20:07.813
The idea of separating Islam from government was unheard of in a Muslim-majority country.

00:20:08.443 --> 00:20:13.153
And indeed, even today, most Muslim-majority countries have

00:20:13.163 --> 00:20:17.216
Islam as the official, state religion; they are not secular.

00:20:18.486 --> 00:20:21.946
As you might imagine, many opposed Atatürk’s decision.

00:20:22.526 --> 00:20:24.086
But he pushed ahead.

00:20:24.646 --> 00:20:26.686
Religious schools were shut down.

00:20:26.996 --> 00:20:29.036
Islamic courts were abolished.

00:20:29.646 --> 00:20:32.966
Turkey was to be a modern, secular state.

00:20:34.076 --> 00:20:37.466
This even came down to legislation around clothing.

00:20:38.326 --> 00:20:44.986
And this brings us on to perhaps the best-known of the reforms: the decision to ban the fez.

00:20:46.036 --> 00:20:52.336
In case you didn’t know, a fez is that hat with no brim, no cap in the front.

00:20:53.246 --> 00:20:57.006
It was particularly popular during the Ottoman Empire, and

00:20:57.156 --> 00:21:00.866
it was also practical for the majority Muslim population.

00:21:02.026 --> 00:21:06.241
Because it had no cap, no bit in the front, you could wear

00:21:06.241 --> 00:21:10.081
it during prayers, and touch your forehead to the ground.

00:21:11.011 --> 00:21:18.001
Kemal, so the story goes, was no great fan of this Islamic practice of prostrating yourself

00:21:18.131 --> 00:21:24.191
and touching your head on the floor, so he banned the hats that made this practice possible.

00:21:25.351 --> 00:21:31.751
Instead, Turkish men were ordered to adopt European-style hats, which would help create

00:21:31.811 --> 00:21:38.331
a modern, Western-style identity for Turkey, and provide a clear break with the past.

00:21:39.241 --> 00:21:41.141
Then came language reform.

00:21:41.731 --> 00:21:45.881
For centuries, the Turkish language had been written in Arabic

00:21:45.891 --> 00:21:51.181
script, and it also had a bunch of loan words from Persian and Arabic.

00:21:51.891 --> 00:21:56.431
As a result, it was a script that many found difficult to read and write.

00:21:57.390 --> 00:22:02.751
Mustafa Kemal wanted literacy rates to rise, and he believed that by

00:22:02.751 --> 00:22:07.201
simplifying the language, more people would be able to read and write.

00:22:08.131 --> 00:22:13.111
A modern nation, after all, needed a modern, accessible language.

00:22:14.051 --> 00:22:20.231
And so, in 1928, he ordered the complete switch to the Latin alphabet.

00:22:21.071 --> 00:22:23.011
It was an extraordinary move.

00:22:23.641 --> 00:22:28.645
Overnight, books, newspapers, and street signs had to be rewritten.

00:22:29.725 --> 00:22:35.710
Mustafa Kemal himself went from town to town, teaching people how to use the new script.

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:40.000
There are photos of him, the President, standing in front of a

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.200
blackboard, chalk in hand, demonstrating the new style of writing.

00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:47.561
Education was another priority.

00:22:48.161 --> 00:22:54.629
The Ottoman Empire had an education system where religious and secular schools operated separately.

00:22:55.517 --> 00:22:58.619
Mustafa Kemal scrapped this system entirely.

00:22:59.099 --> 00:23:04.949
A new, unified education system was put in place, free from religious influence.

00:23:05.659 --> 00:23:11.509
Schools were to focus on science, mathematics, and modern subjects,

00:23:11.769 --> 00:23:15.819
subjects that would allow Turkey to compete in the modern world.

00:23:16.469 --> 00:23:20.469
Women, too, saw dramatic changes under his leadership.

00:23:21.149 --> 00:23:26.299
Under Ottoman rule, women had been largely excluded from public life.

00:23:27.069 --> 00:23:33.709
But now, under the new republic, they were encouraged to work, study, and participate in politics.

00:23:34.305 --> 00:23:39.769
Women were granted the right to vote in Turkey in 1934, a fact that many

00:23:39.769 --> 00:23:44.959
Turkish people like to point out is earlier than in many European countries.

00:23:45.969 --> 00:23:49.689
But these changes did not come without resistance.

00:23:50.239 --> 00:23:56.959
Many in Turkey, particularly in the countryside, saw these reforms as an attack on their traditions.

00:23:57.439 --> 00:24:02.599
There were rebellions, opposition movements, and even assassination attempts.

00:24:03.439 --> 00:24:07.509
But Mustafa Kemal was ruthless in his determination.

00:24:08.269 --> 00:24:13.120
He cracked down on dissent, exiling or imprisoning those who opposed his vision.

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:18.120
He believed there was no room for delay, no time for debate.

00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:22.770
Turkey had to modernise, and it had to do it quickly.

00:24:23.790 --> 00:24:29.620
Now, there are those who criticised and still criticise his methods, but it is hard to

00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:35.900
argue about his effectiveness as the primary architect of the Turkey that exists today.

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:41.900
By the time he died in 1938, the country he left behind was

00:24:41.978 --> 00:24:45.950
unrecognisable from the Ottoman state he had been born into.

00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:50.130
Turkey was a republic, not a sultanate.

00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:54.370
It had a secular government, a modern legal system, a new

00:24:54.370 --> 00:24:59.540
language, and an education system modelled on Western ideals.

00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:07.330
He was given the surname “Atatürk” in 1934, meaning “father of the Turks”.

00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:12.010
This was, in fact, the same year he introduced a law

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:15.342
requiring all Turkish citizens to adopt a surname.

00:25:16.338 --> 00:25:22.030
Until then, as you heard about at the start of the episode, most people used only a

00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:27.864
first name and a title or  patronymic, a name that signalled who their father was.

00:25:28.734 --> 00:25:34.614
But now, for the first time, every Turk was required to choose a family name.

00:25:35.704 --> 00:25:41.284
His given surname was, of course, ‘Atatürk,’ meaning ‘Father of the Turks.

00:25:42.114 --> 00:25:48.964
Every year, at exactly 09:05 am on the 10th of November, the exact time ‘Atatürk died,

00:25:49.394 --> 00:25:55.294
the entire country of Turkey stops what it is doing to observe a minute’s silence.

00:25:56.104 --> 00:25:59.884
Buses stop in the middle of the road, workers put down their

00:25:59.884 --> 00:26:04.724
tools, and TV chatshow hosts bow their heads in respect.

00:26:05.824 --> 00:26:11.424
He might have been draconian at times, he has been called a dictator, but it is hard

00:26:11.454 --> 00:26:17.444
to argue that anybody is more deserving of the title “The father of modern Turkey”.

00:26:18.704 --> 00:26:23.384
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Mustafa Kemal Atatürk.

00:26:23.714 --> 00:26:26.944
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:26:27.534 --> 00:26:32.044
For the Turkish listeners out there, and the dozens of people who have asked me

00:26:32.054 --> 00:26:36.054
over the years to make an episode about Atatürk, I hope you in particular enjoyed

00:26:36.054 --> 00:26:40.764
it, and thought it did some justice to this clearly incredibly impressive leader.

00:26:41.584 --> 00:26:45.124
And as always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:26:45.384 --> 00:26:49.571
What other interesting nuggets do you think people should know about Atatürk?

00:26:49.964 --> 00:26:53.604
Do you think Erdogan sees himself as a 21st-century

00:26:53.624 --> 00:26:57.834
Atatürk, and if so, how is this manifesting itself?

00:26:58.424 --> 00:26:59.364
I would love to know.

00:26:59.607 --> 00:27:02.088
