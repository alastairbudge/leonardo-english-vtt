Hello, hello, hello, and welcome

00:00:07.829 --> 00:00:09.809
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.639
Minds, by Leonardo English, the show

00:00:12.649 --> 00:00:14.339
where you can listen to fascinating

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:16.809
stories and learn weird and wonderful

00:00:16.819 --> 00:00:18.829
things about the world at the same

00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:20.689
time as improving your English.

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:24.239
I'm Alastair Budge, and today it’s part

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:27.099
three of our three-part mini-series

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:29.729
on “Tyrants Of The Roman Empire”.

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:32.459
In case you missed them, part one was

00:00:32.459 --> 00:00:35.528
on Caligula, part two was on Nero,

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:37.369
and we are going to round off the

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:39.770
series by talking about Commodus,

00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:42.119
the so-called “Gladiator Emperor”.

00:00:42.779 --> 00:00:45.369
You can listen to this episode without

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:47.259
having listened to the previous two,

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:49.919
but it will make more sense if you’ve

00:00:49.919 --> 00:00:51.889
listened to those, as I’ll reference a

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.359
few names and events from those periods.

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:56.879
So, if you’d prefer to listen to

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.849
those first and you haven’t done so

00:00:58.849 --> 00:01:01.569
already, now is the time to press pause.

00:01:02.279 --> 00:01:04.669
OK then, let’s get started

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:07.049
and talk about Commodus.

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.409
Millions of people around the world

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.239
today turn to the musings of the

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:15.628
Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius.

00:01:16.449 --> 00:01:19.849
Although it’s almost 2,000 years old,

00:01:20.169 --> 00:01:22.909
his internal thoughts about “how to

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:25.259
live a good life”, immortalised in

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.589
Meditations, have become a sort of

00:01:27.629 --> 00:01:30.919
guidebook, a blueprint for how to be

00:01:30.919 --> 00:01:34.599
content and satisfied, even today, in

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:37.359
a world that bears little similarity

00:01:37.589 --> 00:01:39.679
to the one in which Aurelius lived.

00:01:40.699 --> 00:01:44.089
As such, we think of Aurelius as a wise

00:01:44.349 --> 00:01:47.599
and thoughtful man, a man who carefully

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:50.109
considered every decision, evaluating

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:52.519
the advantages and disadvantages

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:55.019
before choosing the wisest path.

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:59.299
He was, undoubtedly, one of the better

00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:02.659
rulers of Rome and was praised both by

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:05.309
his contemporaries and historians looking

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:07.809
back on his 19-year stint in power.

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.859
On a personal level, some decisions

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:14.419
are more debatable, whether that’s

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:16.779
his tolerance of his wife’s frequent

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:19.319
infidelity, his willingness to turn a

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:22.759
blind eye to court scandals, or even his

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:25.119
habit of promoting his favourites over

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:27.549
other, perhaps more talented, people.

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:30.539
There is one decision, though, which

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:33.399
has forever tarnished his legacy.

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:37.469
He named as his successor his son

00:02:37.749 --> 00:02:40.809
Commodus, a man who has gone down in

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:44.109
history as a tyrant, an imbecile, a

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:47.969
sadist, a megalomaniac, a madman, and,

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.859
to quote the Roman historian Cassius

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:53.239
Dio, “a greater curse to the Romans

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.379
than any pestilence or any crime”.

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:00.219
Now, one can certainly argue that

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:02.989
Marcus Aurelius had little choice but

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:06.019
to nominate Commodus as his heir; he

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.429
had no other surviving sons, and failing

00:03:09.429 --> 00:03:11.869
to name Commodus as his successor would

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:13.809
have put his son’s life in danger.

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.436
And Marcus Aurelius was human after all.

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:22.309
Any parent’s first preoccupation is for

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:25.259
the safety of their child, and it’s not

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.749
difficult to see how Marcus Aurelius

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:30.449
might have overlooked some early signs

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:32.449
of Commodus’ insuitability for the

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.399
top job, if indeed there were signs.

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:39.389
So, perhaps he had no other option,

00:03:39.779 --> 00:03:42.749
or at least no other good options, but

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:45.459
the choice to go with Commodus would

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.709
forever be a black mark on the otherwise

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:51.279
positive legacy of Marcus Aurelius.

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:54.769
So, to the early life of Commodus.

00:03:55.889 --> 00:04:00.569
He was born in AD 161, the first

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:02.944
emperor to be born “in the purple”,

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:05.879
or born during his father’s reign.

00:04:07.279 --> 00:04:09.419
As you will remember from the previous

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:11.999
two episodes, most Roman emperors

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:14.179
didn’t have a clear successor;

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:16.299
there was constant jockeying for

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.140
power through affairs, marriages,

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:22.196
divorces, adoptions and poisonings,

00:04:22.616 --> 00:04:25.449
and parents–often divorced or widowed

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:29.059
mothers–tried to position their sons as

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:31.379
first in line to the title of emperor.

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:35.249
Marcus Aurelius was an exception,

00:04:35.709 --> 00:04:37.139
in that he had a relatively

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:39.729
uncomplicated personal life.

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:43.339
He was only married once, and the

00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:45.989
marriage bore at least 14 children.

00:04:46.799 --> 00:04:49.389
But only one son and four

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:51.529
daughters were still alive at

00:04:51.559 --> 00:04:52.955
the time of their father’s death.

00:04:54.209 --> 00:04:56.539
The daughters, this being Ancient

00:04:56.539 --> 00:04:59.159
Rome, didn’t get a look in; they didn’t

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:01.139
feature in the succession planning.

00:05:02.089 --> 00:05:05.939
This left the one and only son: Commodus.

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:11.149
And from a very young age, he had been

00:05:11.149 --> 00:05:13.529
groomed for the role of Roman Emperor.

00:05:14.489 --> 00:05:17.149
He was officially made Caesar at the age

00:05:17.179 --> 00:05:19.919
of 5, together with his younger brother.

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:23.009
Caesar, by the way, means the

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:25.689
designated heir; the son who will

00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:27.869
become emperor on his father’s death.

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:31.659
His younger brother, his co-Caesar,

00:05:31.959 --> 00:05:34.639
Marcus Annius Verus, died a few years

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:37.409
later, which made Commodus the sole heir.

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:40.299
He travelled around with his father,

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:42.259
following his military campaign

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:44.799
in Germany, and is thought to have

00:05:44.799 --> 00:05:46.849
received personal tuition from

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:48.649
the best scholars at the time.

00:05:49.959 --> 00:05:52.779
As Marcus Aurelius grew older, and

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:54.839
following a particularly threatening

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:56.959
uprising by one of his governors,

00:05:57.205 --> 00:05:59.599
Avidius Cassius, he gave his son

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:01.929
increasing responsibilities, making

00:06:01.929 --> 00:06:04.659
it abundantly clear that Commodus

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:06.759
was his handpicked successor.

00:06:07.859 --> 00:06:10.029
First came the victory title

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:12.112
of Germanicus, then the title

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:14.409
of Imperator, then consul.

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:17.619
And for a couple of years,

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:19.369
he ruled jointly with his

00:06:19.369 --> 00:06:21.509
father, with Marcus Aurelius.

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:27.739
And in March 180 AD, his father died,

00:06:28.089 --> 00:06:31.195
leaving the then 18-year-old Commodus the

00:06:31.195 --> 00:06:34.069
undisputed and official Roman Emperor.

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:38.249
At first, the transition was smooth.

00:06:39.099 --> 00:06:41.359
Commodus inherited an empire that

00:06:41.359 --> 00:06:45.809
was stable, wealthy, and at relative

00:06:45.829 --> 00:06:48.229
peace, by Roman standards at least.

00:06:48.979 --> 00:06:50.989
His father’s long wars on

00:06:50.989 --> 00:06:52.479
the Danube frontier were

00:06:52.839 --> 00:06:54.529
effectively coming to an end.

00:06:55.559 --> 00:06:57.779
The Senate and the army accepted

00:06:57.779 --> 00:06:59.599
him without serious opposition.

00:07:00.599 --> 00:07:02.909
For many Romans, this looked like

00:07:02.919 --> 00:07:05.609
the best possible scenario: a young

00:07:05.639 --> 00:07:09.069
emperor, born into legitimacy, stepping

00:07:09.079 --> 00:07:11.009
into his father’s shoes without

00:07:11.019 --> 00:07:13.319
the messy power struggles that had

00:07:13.319 --> 00:07:15.349
accompanied so many of his predecessors.

00:07:16.702 --> 00:07:19.339
But the contrast between father

00:07:19.549 --> 00:07:22.189
and son soon became obvious.

00:07:22.829 --> 00:07:25.419
Marcus Aurelius was austere,

00:07:25.429 --> 00:07:28.279
philosophical, and endlessly patient.

00:07:29.099 --> 00:07:31.369
Commodus was none of these things.

00:07:32.259 --> 00:07:35.509
Ancient writers describe him as lazy,

00:07:35.929 --> 00:07:38.989
vain, and obsessed with personal pleasure.

00:07:40.369 --> 00:07:42.499
Where his father had spent years in

00:07:42.509 --> 00:07:44.909
muddy camps on the German frontier,

00:07:45.219 --> 00:07:47.139
fighting for the glory of Rome,

00:07:47.639 --> 00:07:49.659
Commodus preferred the comfort of

00:07:49.659 --> 00:07:52.539
the palace, the baths, and the arena.

00:07:53.849 --> 00:07:55.579
He made peace with the Germanic

00:07:55.589 --> 00:07:58.409
tribes almost immediately, abandoning

00:07:58.409 --> 00:08:00.149
his father’s planned campaigns.

00:08:01.399 --> 00:08:03.869
For Rome’s soldiers and generals,

00:08:04.199 --> 00:08:05.929
this felt like throwing away

00:08:06.159 --> 00:08:08.119
years of hard-won gains.

00:08:08.972 --> 00:08:11.139
For Commodus, it meant he could return

00:08:11.139 --> 00:08:14.389
to Rome, parade in triumph, and present

00:08:14.399 --> 00:08:16.729
himself as the bringer of peace.

00:08:18.212 --> 00:08:21.502
And once back in Rome, his reign

00:08:21.882 --> 00:08:23.942
began to take on a different tone.

00:08:25.082 --> 00:08:28.322
He delighted in public shows, extravagant

00:08:28.322 --> 00:08:32.172
spectacles, and above all, in himself.

00:08:33.332 --> 00:08:36.742
Coins were minted showing him as Hercules,

00:08:36.942 --> 00:08:40.122
draped in a lion-skin, carrying a club.

00:08:40.892 --> 00:08:42.772
Statues were erected

00:08:42.842 --> 00:08:45.105
portraying him as a demigod.

00:08:46.005 --> 00:08:48.342
He renamed months of the year after

00:08:48.342 --> 00:08:51.242
his own titles and would even go so far

00:08:51.512 --> 00:08:54.742
as to rename Rome itself the “Colonia

00:08:54.922 --> 00:08:58.002
Commodiana”, the Colony of Commodus.

00:08:59.362 --> 00:09:01.722
If Marcus Aurelius had been the

00:09:01.732 --> 00:09:04.852
model of self-restraint, Commodus

00:09:05.012 --> 00:09:07.482
was the model of self-indulgence.

00:09:08.672 --> 00:09:10.942
And soon, that indulgence would

00:09:10.942 --> 00:09:13.262
extend beyond self-glorification

00:09:13.592 --> 00:09:15.622
to something that horrified Rome’s

00:09:15.622 --> 00:09:18.612
elite, the emperor’s decision to step

00:09:18.922 --> 00:09:22.172
into the gladiatorial arena, not as

00:09:22.172 --> 00:09:25.162
a spectator, but as a participant.

00:09:25.602 --> 00:09:26.842
As a gladiator.

00:09:28.022 --> 00:09:30.912
Now, as you probably know, and as

00:09:30.912 --> 00:09:33.152
we touched on in previous episodes,

00:09:33.392 --> 00:09:36.292
gladiators were right at the bottom of

00:09:36.292 --> 00:09:38.982
the social pecking order in Ancient Rome.

00:09:39.982 --> 00:09:42.962
They were often slaves, criminals, or

00:09:42.962 --> 00:09:45.882
prisoners of war, trained to fight to

00:09:45.882 --> 00:09:48.282
the death for the amusement of the crowd.

00:09:49.282 --> 00:09:50.742
They might be admired for their

00:09:50.752 --> 00:09:52.942
bravery, and indeed, they could

00:09:52.952 --> 00:09:54.652
win their freedom if they were

00:09:54.652 --> 00:09:56.222
successful enough in the arena.

00:09:56.672 --> 00:09:59.012
But they were disposable.

00:09:59.252 --> 00:10:00.482
Their lives were cheap.

00:10:00.852 --> 00:10:03.572
They were entertainment, not citizens.

00:10:04.012 --> 00:10:06.182
And they certainly weren’t emperors.

00:10:07.302 --> 00:10:10.122
So when Commodus began not just

00:10:10.122 --> 00:10:12.742
sponsoring games, but also entering

00:10:12.742 --> 00:10:15.822
the arena himself, it was scandalous.

00:10:17.062 --> 00:10:19.262
He is described as having fought

00:10:19.322 --> 00:10:21.722
hundreds of times, with one account

00:10:21.992 --> 00:10:23.882
saying that he fought as a gladiator

00:10:24.102 --> 00:10:26.862
on more than 1,000 occasions.

00:10:28.372 --> 00:10:29.862
Of course, the fights

00:10:29.862 --> 00:10:31.162
were carefully staged.

00:10:31.342 --> 00:10:33.462
He never faced a serious opponent.

00:10:34.832 --> 00:10:37.412
He would, reportedly, start with

00:10:37.412 --> 00:10:40.062
birds or animals kept in nets or

00:10:40.062 --> 00:10:42.442
cages, so they couldn’t fight back.

00:10:43.242 --> 00:10:45.262
It wasn’t a “fight” so

00:10:45.262 --> 00:10:46.912
much as an execution.

00:10:47.902 --> 00:10:49.872
Then he would move on to more

00:10:49.872 --> 00:10:51.892
exotic animals, cheetahs,

00:10:52.242 --> 00:10:54.282
lions and even elephants.

00:10:55.142 --> 00:10:56.622
Again, this wouldn’t be

00:10:56.622 --> 00:10:58.822
a fair fight, man vs.

00:10:58.852 --> 00:10:59.292
beast.

00:10:59.762 --> 00:11:02.012
Commodus would stand high up in the

00:11:02.012 --> 00:11:04.802
gallery with a bow and arrow, and he

00:11:04.802 --> 00:11:06.832
would dispatch the animals from the

00:11:06.842 --> 00:11:09.782
comfort and safety of his private box.

00:11:10.872 --> 00:11:13.482
In a single day, he is reported to

00:11:13.482 --> 00:11:16.272
have killed 100 lions, which is, of

00:11:16.312 --> 00:11:18.452
course, no reflection on his talents

00:11:18.472 --> 00:11:21.512
as a marksman, as an archer, but rather

00:11:21.772 --> 00:11:24.412
of his insatiable thirst for blood.

00:11:25.582 --> 00:11:27.642
And he is also remembered for

00:11:27.652 --> 00:11:29.942
getting into the arena himself, for

00:11:29.942 --> 00:11:32.682
a “fight” with human gladiators.

00:11:33.532 --> 00:11:36.252
Again, his survival is no reflection

00:11:36.252 --> 00:11:39.142
of his skill with a sword, but rather

00:11:39.162 --> 00:11:41.312
of the fact that his opponents were

00:11:41.312 --> 00:11:44.002
instructed not to fight back and

00:11:44.012 --> 00:11:46.672
given blunt and ineffective weapons.

00:11:48.052 --> 00:11:50.362
In some cases, they were completely

00:11:50.452 --> 00:11:53.232
unarmed, unable to defend themselves,

00:11:53.572 --> 00:11:55.892
and Commodus merely played the

00:11:55.892 --> 00:11:58.232
role of public executioner.

00:11:59.672 --> 00:12:02.712
On one famous occasion, he is reported

00:12:02.942 --> 00:12:05.322
to have rounded up all men in Rome

00:12:05.702 --> 00:12:08.032
who had lost a foot and had them

00:12:08.032 --> 00:12:11.482
tied together to resemble giants, and

00:12:11.482 --> 00:12:13.902
he then clubbed them all to death.

00:12:15.375 --> 00:12:18.295
And to make matters worse, or

00:12:18.635 --> 00:12:20.945
even more bizarre, he demanded

00:12:21.115 --> 00:12:23.045
payment for his “victories”.

00:12:24.552 --> 00:12:27.535
Cassius Dio writes that he would charge

00:12:27.535 --> 00:12:30.985
the city one million sesterces for each

00:12:31.015 --> 00:12:34.225
appearance, a vast sum, practically

00:12:34.375 --> 00:12:36.725
bankrupting the treasury for what

00:12:36.725 --> 00:12:38.845
were essentially vanity performances.

00:12:40.435 --> 00:12:43.295
And it wasn’t just the financial cost.

00:12:43.705 --> 00:12:47.135
For Rome’s elite, this was humiliation.

00:12:47.845 --> 00:12:50.795
Nero had acted in plays, which was

00:12:50.975 --> 00:12:53.445
embarrassing, but an emperor as a

00:12:53.465 --> 00:12:56.515
gladiator was on another level altogether.

00:12:57.455 --> 00:12:59.875
The emperor, who was supposedly

00:12:59.915 --> 00:13:01.775
chosen by the gods to rule the

00:13:01.785 --> 00:13:04.305
world, now played the part of a

00:13:04.375 --> 00:13:07.255
common slave for cheers and applause.

00:13:08.675 --> 00:13:11.815
The ordinary people, however, loved it.

00:13:12.425 --> 00:13:14.655
They packed the Colosseum to watch their

00:13:14.685 --> 00:13:17.335
emperor dressed as Hercules, club in

00:13:17.335 --> 00:13:20.355
hand, boasting of his divine strength.

00:13:21.625 --> 00:13:23.975
Commodus leaned into this image,

00:13:24.195 --> 00:13:26.835
declaring himself not only Hercules

00:13:26.845 --> 00:13:30.315
reborn but also the new founder of Rome.

00:13:31.755 --> 00:13:34.865
And while Commodus was “busy” in the

00:13:34.865 --> 00:13:37.265
arena, lapping up the cheers of the

00:13:37.265 --> 00:13:39.865
audience or giggling at the sight

00:13:39.865 --> 00:13:42.265
of the bloodthirsty events unfolding

00:13:42.265 --> 00:13:44.415
below, the day-to-day business

00:13:44.435 --> 00:13:46.575
of running Rome was left in the

00:13:46.575 --> 00:13:49.032
hands of favourites and courtiers.

00:13:50.149 --> 00:13:52.265
First came a freedman called

00:13:52.265 --> 00:13:55.405
Saoterus, who acted as a chamberlain

00:13:55.685 --> 00:13:58.025
and enjoyed enormous influence.

00:13:58.655 --> 00:14:01.345
He only lasted a couple of years, as

00:14:01.485 --> 00:14:05.665
he was murdered in 182 AD by another

00:14:05.665 --> 00:14:08.925
freedman named Cleander, who assumed

00:14:08.935 --> 00:14:10.645
the roles and responsibilities

00:14:10.925 --> 00:14:12.765
previously held by Saoterus.

00:14:13.909 --> 00:14:16.065
Cleander effectively ran the

00:14:16.065 --> 00:14:18.445
empire for several years, selling

00:14:18.475 --> 00:14:21.185
offices, governorships, and even

00:14:21.185 --> 00:14:23.155
Senate seats to the highest bidder.

00:14:24.065 --> 00:14:26.575
It was government as an open auction,

00:14:26.965 --> 00:14:29.555
and it bred resentment and chaos.

00:14:30.805 --> 00:14:34.715
In AD 190, when a shortage of grain

00:14:34.815 --> 00:14:37.825
caused riots in Rome, the mob turned

00:14:37.835 --> 00:14:40.625
on Cleander, demanding his execution.

00:14:41.645 --> 00:14:44.085
Commodus, whose primary concern

00:14:44.085 --> 00:14:46.055
was self-preservation, had his

00:14:46.055 --> 00:14:48.665
former favourite killed, but the

00:14:48.675 --> 00:14:51.985
episode left the empire unstable,

00:14:52.175 --> 00:14:54.845
and the emperor even more isolated.

00:14:56.182 --> 00:15:00.982
And by this point, AD 192, Commodus was a

00:15:00.982 --> 00:15:04.840
man completely consumed by his delusions.

00:15:05.622 --> 00:15:08.012
He renamed the legions after himself,

00:15:08.232 --> 00:15:10.362
declared every day a holiday in

00:15:10.362 --> 00:15:12.782
his honour, and insisted that

00:15:12.792 --> 00:15:15.002
statues of himself as Hercules

00:15:15.302 --> 00:15:17.252
be erected across the empire.

00:15:18.782 --> 00:15:21.132
And while the emperor lived in

00:15:21.132 --> 00:15:23.962
this god-like fantasy, the city

00:15:23.962 --> 00:15:26.392
he ruled was sinking into misery.

00:15:27.112 --> 00:15:29.822
The treasury was empty, the Senate

00:15:29.992 --> 00:15:32.582
was humiliated, and the people

00:15:32.582 --> 00:15:35.002
of Rome, who might have once been

00:15:35.032 --> 00:15:37.512
entertained by his games, now only

00:15:37.512 --> 00:15:39.862
saw corruption and instability.

00:15:41.032 --> 00:15:44.202
And the final straw came with what he

00:15:44.202 --> 00:15:48.339
planned to do on New Year of AD 193.

00:15:49.502 --> 00:15:52.102
Now, New Year was an important

00:15:52.102 --> 00:15:53.662
day in the Roman calendar.

00:15:54.062 --> 00:15:56.352
It was when magistrates took office,

00:15:56.532 --> 00:15:59.412
sacrifices were made, and the emperor

00:15:59.582 --> 00:16:01.972
made public appearances to mark

00:16:01.972 --> 00:16:04.482
Rome’s continuation and stability.

00:16:05.392 --> 00:16:08.042
Commodus had an unusual idea.

00:16:09.002 --> 00:16:11.402
According to Cassius Dio, he

00:16:11.402 --> 00:16:13.342
announced that in the New Year’s

00:16:13.352 --> 00:16:16.092
festivities he would appear not as

00:16:16.092 --> 00:16:18.632
the emperor, but as a gladiator.

00:16:20.352 --> 00:16:22.132
For Rome’s ruling class,

00:16:22.442 --> 00:16:23.542
this was too much.

00:16:24.142 --> 00:16:26.455
The Senate might flatter an emperor,

00:16:26.842 --> 00:16:29.412
tolerate excess, even turn a blind

00:16:29.432 --> 00:16:32.352
eye to corruption, but the idea of

00:16:32.352 --> 00:16:34.582
the emperor reducing himself to a

00:16:34.622 --> 00:16:36.992
professional gladiator on this highly

00:16:36.992 --> 00:16:40.042
symbolic day, and dragging the empire

00:16:40.042 --> 00:16:42.402
down with him, was intolerable.

00:16:43.892 --> 00:16:46.232
And as with Caligula and Nero

00:16:46.232 --> 00:16:48.762
before him, plots began to form.

00:16:49.812 --> 00:16:52.132
There had, in fact, been multiple

00:16:52.132 --> 00:16:55.142
attempts to kill him, and it is in many

00:16:55.142 --> 00:16:57.432
respects surprising that he managed to

00:16:57.432 --> 00:16:59.722
hold onto power for as long as he did.

00:17:00.362 --> 00:17:04.232
Indeed, in AD 182, just a couple of

00:17:04.232 --> 00:17:06.532
years into his reign, he narrowly

00:17:06.532 --> 00:17:08.252
escaped an assassination attempt

00:17:08.552 --> 00:17:10.852
led not by senators or generals,

00:17:11.202 --> 00:17:13.322
but by his own sister, Lucilla.

00:17:14.252 --> 00:17:16.422
Lucilla was the widow of the

00:17:16.432 --> 00:17:19.192
former co-emperor Lucius Verus,

00:17:19.402 --> 00:17:21.352
and she had expected to play a

00:17:21.362 --> 00:17:23.972
significant role in Roman politics.

00:17:24.492 --> 00:17:26.402
She was older than Commodus

00:17:26.692 --> 00:17:29.062
and, according to Cassius Dio,

00:17:29.222 --> 00:17:31.172
she resented being sidelined.

00:17:32.562 --> 00:17:35.512
So, together with a group of senators,

00:17:35.792 --> 00:17:38.322
she hatched a plan to have him killed.

00:17:39.462 --> 00:17:40.962
It was a simple enough plan.

00:17:41.642 --> 00:17:43.142
Wait until he was coming

00:17:43.142 --> 00:17:45.242
into a theatre, and stab him.

00:17:46.362 --> 00:17:49.482
It should have worked, but it went

00:17:49.542 --> 00:17:52.672
disastrously, almost comically, wrong.

00:17:54.012 --> 00:17:56.462
One of the conspirators confronted

00:17:56.502 --> 00:17:59.452
Commodus in public with a dagger, but

00:17:59.792 --> 00:18:02.232
he couldn’t resist the urge to indulge

00:18:02.232 --> 00:18:04.622
in some Hollywood-style theatrics.

00:18:05.392 --> 00:18:09.192
So instead of stabbing him immediately, he

00:18:09.192 --> 00:18:12.892
declared “The Senate sends you this!”, and

00:18:12.892 --> 00:18:15.342
before he could plunge the dagger into the

00:18:15.342 --> 00:18:18.582
emperor, he was seized Commodus’ guards,

00:18:18.782 --> 00:18:21.692
and the whole conspiracy was unravelled.

00:18:22.812 --> 00:18:24.892
Lucilla was banished to Capri

00:18:25.242 --> 00:18:27.722
and later executed, while many

00:18:27.722 --> 00:18:29.562
of her allies were put to death.

00:18:30.682 --> 00:18:33.018
This was the most famous of the

00:18:33.178 --> 00:18:35.018
failed assassination attempts.

00:18:35.628 --> 00:18:38.118
The successful one came ten years

00:18:38.118 --> 00:18:42.628
later, on New Year’s Eve, AD 192.

00:18:43.918 --> 00:18:46.948
It’s not clear exactly what precipitated

00:18:46.948 --> 00:18:49.788
the plot, but it’s believed that it

00:18:49.818 --> 00:18:51.948
was in reaction to Commodus’ plan

00:18:52.268 --> 00:18:55.808
to arrest and execute three of his

00:18:55.808 --> 00:18:58.568
closest allies: his new chamberlain,

00:18:58.788 --> 00:19:00.928
Eclectus, the head of the Praetorian

00:19:00.938 --> 00:19:04.188
Guard, Laetus, and his mistress, Marcia.

00:19:05.408 --> 00:19:08.128
When Marcia got wind of this plan,

00:19:08.568 --> 00:19:11.458
and presumably realising “it’s either

00:19:11.498 --> 00:19:13.918
me or him”, she sent for the other

00:19:13.918 --> 00:19:16.468
two names on the “hit list”, and the

00:19:16.488 --> 00:19:19.268
three conspired to murder Commodus.

00:19:20.298 --> 00:19:22.068
There were frantic attempts

00:19:22.278 --> 00:19:24.068
to poison him during the day,

00:19:24.418 --> 00:19:26.548
but none of them succeeded.

00:19:27.688 --> 00:19:30.538
Eventually, they called upon a wrestler

00:19:30.808 --> 00:19:33.118
called Narcissus, who was actually

00:19:33.258 --> 00:19:35.648
one of Commodus’s wrestling partners.

00:19:36.538 --> 00:19:38.978
He was sent into Commodus’ chamber

00:19:39.188 --> 00:19:40.878
with instructions to kill him.

00:19:41.988 --> 00:19:43.808
He entered the emperor’s chamber

00:19:44.028 --> 00:19:46.078
and found him in the bath, where

00:19:46.078 --> 00:19:48.108
he proceeded to strangle him.

00:19:49.718 --> 00:19:51.978
Commodus might have been Rome’s most

00:19:51.998 --> 00:19:55.598
decorated and highly-paid gladiator, but

00:19:55.598 --> 00:19:58.908
there, naked in the bath, he was no match

00:19:59.028 --> 00:20:01.778
for a man armed only with his bare hands.

00:20:03.058 --> 00:20:05.499
The emperor, now ex-emperor,

00:20:05.598 --> 00:20:07.168
was thirty-one years old.

00:20:08.188 --> 00:20:10.728
And with his death, the dynasty

00:20:10.758 --> 00:20:12.698
of the philosopher-emperor Marcus

00:20:12.818 --> 00:20:16.038
Aurelius ended in blood and disgrace.

00:20:16.728 --> 00:20:18.988
There were calls for Commodus’ body

00:20:19.148 --> 00:20:20.858
to be dragged through the streets

00:20:20.858 --> 00:20:23.828
of Rome on hooks before being dumped

00:20:24.028 --> 00:20:27.318
into the Tiber, and it almost would

00:20:27.318 --> 00:20:29.268
have been, had it not been for the

00:20:29.288 --> 00:20:32.508
intervention of a consul called Pertinax,

00:20:32.808 --> 00:20:34.768
a man who would in fact go on to be

00:20:34.798 --> 00:20:37.838
Emperor, albeit only for 87 days.

00:20:39.138 --> 00:20:41.498
Although his body wasn’t dragged

00:20:41.518 --> 00:20:44.098
through the streets, the Senate wasted

00:20:44.098 --> 00:20:46.198
no time in condemning his memory.

00:20:47.108 --> 00:20:49.728
They declared a damnatio memoriae,

00:20:50.018 --> 00:20:51.918
erasing his name from inscriptions,

00:20:52.268 --> 00:20:54.468
tearing down his statues, and

00:20:54.478 --> 00:20:56.908
branding him a public enemy.

00:20:58.058 --> 00:20:59.958
To them, he was not just a

00:21:00.038 --> 00:21:02.978
bad emperor, but a tyrant who

00:21:02.978 --> 00:21:04.808
had nearly destroyed Rome.

00:21:05.938 --> 00:21:08.528
In the words of Cassius Dio, Commodus’

00:21:08.528 --> 00:21:11.378
rule marked the descent "from a kingdom

00:21:11.378 --> 00:21:14.708
of gold to one of iron and rust".

00:21:16.308 --> 00:21:19.048
And Rome itself was left in chaos.

00:21:19.758 --> 00:21:21.728
Commodus’s death did not bring

00:21:21.738 --> 00:21:24.718
stability; instead, it plunged the

00:21:24.718 --> 00:21:26.848
empire into what historians have

00:21:26.848 --> 00:21:29.778
called the Year of the Five Emperors,

00:21:30.078 --> 00:21:32.368
a rapid succession of rulers backed

00:21:32.388 --> 00:21:34.658
by rival generals and factions.

00:21:35.568 --> 00:21:38.708
The imperial throne, which was handed

00:21:38.728 --> 00:21:41.318
on a silver plate to Commodus, became

00:21:41.318 --> 00:21:43.648
the most dangerous seat in the world.

00:21:45.318 --> 00:21:48.188
Now, as with the two other subjects

00:21:48.218 --> 00:21:50.308
of this mini-series, it’s important

00:21:50.318 --> 00:21:52.328
to remember that everything we know

00:21:52.328 --> 00:21:55.028
about them was written by men with

00:21:55.058 --> 00:21:57.588
an agenda, and was often written

00:21:57.598 --> 00:21:59.348
many years after their death.

00:22:00.411 --> 00:22:02.428
Cassius Dio, in particular,

00:22:02.728 --> 00:22:04.318
clearly loathed him.

00:22:04.898 --> 00:22:07.738
Yes, it seems very likely that Commodus

00:22:07.738 --> 00:22:09.928
was a pretty awful individual and

00:22:09.928 --> 00:22:12.588
a terrible emperor, but it was very

00:22:12.588 --> 00:22:15.498
convenient for him to be painted as such.

00:22:16.738 --> 00:22:18.958
And this is the thread that runs

00:22:18.958 --> 00:22:20.738
through all three of the tyrants

00:22:20.928 --> 00:22:22.488
we’ve covered in this series.

00:22:22.814 --> 00:22:25.178
Caligula, Nero, Commodus.

00:22:26.018 --> 00:22:28.438
Each of them is remembered as a

00:22:28.448 --> 00:22:32.238
monster, a caricature of cruelty and

00:22:32.238 --> 00:22:35.058
excess, albeit in different ways.

00:22:35.898 --> 00:22:37.928
Each of them was accused of

00:22:37.938 --> 00:22:41.518
madness, of megalomania, of treating

00:22:41.518 --> 00:22:43.608
Rome as their personal stage.

00:22:44.868 --> 00:22:47.678
And yet, in every case, the sources

00:22:47.678 --> 00:22:50.408
we rely on were written by senators,

00:22:50.758 --> 00:22:53.458
historians, or chroniclers who hated

00:22:53.478 --> 00:22:56.038
them, and who often had very good

00:22:56.038 --> 00:22:58.548
reasons to exaggerate their faults.

00:22:59.638 --> 00:23:02.628
So perhaps the question is not just

00:23:02.811 --> 00:23:04.758
“were they really this bad?” but

00:23:05.338 --> 00:23:07.278
“why were they remembered this way?”

00:23:08.858 --> 00:23:12.088
Part of it was certainly deserved; all

00:23:12.088 --> 00:23:14.598
three were tyrants in different ways.

00:23:14.878 --> 00:23:17.988
But part of it was also politics: it

00:23:17.988 --> 00:23:20.688
served the interests of their successors,

00:23:20.948 --> 00:23:23.638
and of Rome’s elite, to present them

00:23:23.638 --> 00:23:26.158
as villains so that later emperors

00:23:26.398 --> 00:23:28.748
might seem like saviours by comparison.

00:23:30.078 --> 00:23:32.738
In that sense, their reputations tell

00:23:32.748 --> 00:23:35.318
us as much about the anxieties and

00:23:35.318 --> 00:23:37.828
priorities of Roman society as they

00:23:37.828 --> 00:23:39.598
do about the emperors themselves.

00:23:40.888 --> 00:23:44.068
What was intolerable was not only cruelty

00:23:44.068 --> 00:23:47.008
or extravagance, which were both not

00:23:47.068 --> 00:23:50.158
uncommon in Rome, but the violation

00:23:50.208 --> 00:23:53.538
of expectations: emperors acting like

00:23:53.538 --> 00:23:56.658
gladiators, emperors singing on stage,

00:23:56.848 --> 00:23:59.268
and emperors humiliating the Senate.

00:24:00.378 --> 00:24:02.598
These were lines Rome’s ruling

00:24:02.598 --> 00:24:04.888
class could not accept, and so

00:24:04.888 --> 00:24:07.148
the rulers who crossed them became

00:24:07.158 --> 00:24:10.068
immortalised as bywords for tyranny.

00:24:11.858 --> 00:24:14.288
OK, then, that is it for today's episode

00:24:14.458 --> 00:24:17.028
on Commodus, and with that comes the

00:24:17.048 --> 00:24:18.968
end of this three-part mini-series

00:24:19.198 --> 00:24:21.228
on “Tyrants Of The Roman Empire”.

00:24:21.798 --> 00:24:23.328
I hope you enjoyed the mini-series

00:24:23.658 --> 00:24:25.528
and that it shone some light on these

00:24:25.538 --> 00:24:27.938
characters that you no doubt had heard

00:24:27.938 --> 00:24:30.178
of, but perhaps were not acquainted

00:24:30.178 --> 00:24:31.858
with every aspect of their life.

00:24:32.698 --> 00:24:34.738
To state the obvious, each of these

00:24:34.758 --> 00:24:37.228
episodes could have been ten times longer,

00:24:37.548 --> 00:24:39.558
and choosing what to include and what

00:24:39.628 --> 00:24:41.798
not to include was a task in itself.

00:24:42.398 --> 00:24:44.318
But we will probably return to

00:24:44.328 --> 00:24:46.148
some of the topics and stories in

00:24:46.148 --> 00:24:48.258
future episodes, like the story of

00:24:48.258 --> 00:24:50.988
the luckless eunuch, Sporus, so you

00:24:50.988 --> 00:24:52.708
have that to look forward to at some

00:24:52.708 --> 00:24:54.938
stage in the not-too-distant future.

00:24:55.908 --> 00:24:57.818
You've been listening to English Learning

00:24:57.818 --> 00:25:00.598
for Curious Minds by Leonardo English.

00:25:01.028 --> 00:25:03.908
I'm Alastair Budge, you stay safe, and

00:25:03.908 --> 00:25:06.338
I'll catch you in the next episode.
