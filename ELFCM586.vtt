Hello, hello, hello, and welcome

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.250
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.129
Minds, by Leonardo English, the show

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.069
where you can listen to fascinating

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.619
stories and learn weird and wonderful

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.759
things about the world at the same

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:21.560
time as improving your English.

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.260
I'm Alastair Budge, and in this episode

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.720
we are going to be talking about the news.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.930
But not any news.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.120
Today, in our last episode of the

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.230
year, we are going to be looking

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.910
back at six of the most unusual

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.880
news stories from the UK in 2025.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.160
From KFC ice cream to crocodiles to

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.910
strange objects left on trains, this

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.890
is going to be a celebration of fun,

00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:57.749
mostly harmless, and most certainly

00:00:58.049 --> 00:01:01.000
unusual news from the past 12 months.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.820
So, let’s not waste a minute

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.990
and get right into it.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.850
If you have spent much time

00:01:09.099 --> 00:01:12.280
following the British news in 2025,

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.379
you could be forgiven for thinking

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.360
that it is all doom and gloom.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.950
Tax rises, protests, political

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.740
scandal, social division, talk

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.550
of the country going to the dogs.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.010
While some of that may be

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.050
true, it isn’t going to be the

00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:35.150
subject of today’s episode.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.390
Today, we are only going to talk

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.010
about good, or rather, unusual news.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.299
The kind of news that doesn’t make

00:01:45.309 --> 00:01:47.820
the front page, because it isn’t that

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.329
newsworthy, it’s not that important.

00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:53.439
But it is unusual, in some

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.740
cases funny, and a break from

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.830
the gloom of the front pages.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.679
So, our first story is about

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.469
road signs, the signs placed

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.519
on the side of public roads.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.939
You know, the kind of signs with

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:12.340
information like how many miles it

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.600
is to various towns, if there is a

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.049
certain speed limit, all the stuff that

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.209
a driver might need to be aware of.

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:23.359
The UK, as you will probably

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.609
know, is a relatively wet country,

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:29.040
wet and muddy in many parts.

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:33.140
And these road signs can get quite dirty,

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.980
with cars splashing through puddles and

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.820
covering them in muddy water, and so on.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.610
And with local councils having

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.369
ever-diminishing budgets, well,

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.038
many road signs aren’t cleaned as

00:02:49.038 --> 00:02:51.019
often as they probably should be.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.049
If you’ve spent much time driving

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.670
around the UK, well, you probably

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.120
know what I’m talking about.

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.420
And when confronted with a dirty road

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.179
sign, most drivers no doubt think, “Well,

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.140
that’s a bit annoying, you can hardly

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.329
read what’s written there! They should

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.709
definitely send someone to clean that”.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.189
Maybe they mutter about it to a

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.709
neighbour, or tell the hairdresser about

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.232
it when they’re getting their hair cut.

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:23.170
But nothing more comes of it.

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:25.730
The signs remain as muddy

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.730
and dirty as always.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.830
This year, however, one man made the news

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.859
for taking things into his own hands.

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:39.140
Jake Tredgett, a young man from

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.780
Norwich, decided that if his local

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.810
council wasn’t going to clean

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.310
these road signs, well, he would.

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.700
Earlier this year, he started

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:54.510
posting videos of himself washing

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.439
dirty road signs, and he went

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.640
viral, racking up millions of views

00:04:01.008 --> 00:04:04.088
of dirty signs being powerwashed.

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.850
He drives around his local area and

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:10.060
apparently stops whenever he sees a

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.360
dirty sign, grabs his power washer and

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.070
his phone, and leaves 10 minutes later

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:18.989
with the sign looking sparkling new.

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:22.409
I must confess that I watched a

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.120
few of these videos, you know,

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.070
as research for this episode, and

00:04:27.429 --> 00:04:29.550
I can see why they were popular.

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.569
They are oddly cathartic, and there is

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.550
something surprisingly pleasing about

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.429
seeing a filthy road sign, and then 30

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.010
seconds later–with the video sped up, of

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.830
course–the thing looks brand new again.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:47.700
Something else I noticed, however,

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.430
is that there is another aspect of

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.630
this story; he isn’t just a random

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:55.500
guy with a passion for cleaning.

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.280
He has a cleaning business, and I’m

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.760
sure his new-found social media success

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.430
hasn’t exactly been terrible for new

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.010
clients, so to say he is doing it

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:08.260
completely out of the goodness of his

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.080
own heart is perhaps a simplification.

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:15.230
But nevertheless, the signs in the

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.750
Norwich area are in slightly better

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.916
condition, thanks to Jake Tredgett,

00:05:20.059 --> 00:05:23.250
and in my book that is no bad thing.

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.279
Unusual story number two is about

00:05:27.359 --> 00:05:30.180
KFC, Kentucky Fried Chicken.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.599
Now, like lots of companies, KFC

00:05:34.876 --> 00:05:37.950
UK likes to jump on the April

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.590
Fool’s bandwagon by announcing

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.030
all sorts of implausible things.

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.050
This year, it announced that

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.829
it was launching its own brand

00:05:47.953 --> 00:05:50.700
of “Fried-Chicken Toothpaste”.

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:53.980
This “press announcement” came out

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.640
on April 1st, so it was obviously

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.430
never meant to be taken seriously.

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:02.579
But just a month later there was an

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.010
announcement from KFC about a real

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.500
product, and one that is almost

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.150
as unbelievable as fried-chicken

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:15.669
flavoured toothpaste: gravy gelato.

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:19.360
Now gravy, in case you don’t know that

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:23.060
word, is the sauce you make from the fat

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:26.130
and juices released when you cook meat.

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:29.600
It’s normally a brownish sort of

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.180
colour, and you pour it over meat

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:34.130
to give it some extra flavour

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:36.789
and to make it taste less dry.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:41.730
And in the UK, gravy is a particularly

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:45.066
popular option at KFC; people think it

00:06:45.066 --> 00:06:47.716
goes very well with the fried chicken.

00:06:48.326 --> 00:06:49.926
So that’s gravy.

00:06:50.686 --> 00:06:53.526
And as for gelato, well you

00:06:53.526 --> 00:06:55.516
might know this is ice cream.

00:06:56.086 --> 00:06:58.806
Gelato is the Italian word for ice cream.

00:06:59.132 --> 00:07:02.416
But there is an additional nuance we

00:07:02.416 --> 00:07:06.136
need to mention; in the UK, like in

00:07:06.146 --> 00:07:09.516
many countries, some shops or brands

00:07:09.886 --> 00:07:12.966
have started to use “gelato” instead

00:07:12.966 --> 00:07:15.816
of ice cream to make it sound like a

00:07:15.876 --> 00:07:18.796
different and more premium product.

00:07:19.426 --> 00:07:22.036
“Oh no, this isn’t normal ice cream;

00:07:22.036 --> 00:07:24.736
this is gelato”, or something like that.

00:07:25.746 --> 00:07:29.966
So, in May of this year, KFC

00:07:30.336 --> 00:07:32.196
announced that it would be selling

00:07:32.206 --> 00:07:35.996
a limited edition “gravy gelato”.

00:07:36.356 --> 00:07:38.956
Not gravy “ice cream”, which might be

00:07:38.956 --> 00:07:41.866
just normal, bog standard low-quality

00:07:41.866 --> 00:07:45.896
ice cream, but premium gravy “gelato”.

00:07:47.416 --> 00:07:49.436
According to the official release,

00:07:49.916 --> 00:07:52.276
“With a luxuriously velvety texture

00:07:52.276 --> 00:07:54.126
that melts in your mouth, this

00:07:54.216 --> 00:07:57.646
unexpected savoury delight blends

00:07:57.656 --> 00:08:01.356
KFC’s unmistakable bold taste with

00:08:01.356 --> 00:08:04.776
traditional Italian gelato craftsmanship.”

00:08:06.106 --> 00:08:08.466
And it continued, “Whether you spoon

00:08:08.466 --> 00:08:10.846
it straight from the tub, serve it up

00:08:11.066 --> 00:08:13.816
as a sidekick to chicken and waffles,

00:08:14.096 --> 00:08:17.396
or bring it out as the main event at

00:08:17.396 --> 00:08:20.636
your next Sunday roast – this one’s for

00:08:20.636 --> 00:08:23.326
the gravy lovers, the flavour chasers,

00:08:23.736 --> 00:08:26.996
and anyone brave enough to blur the

00:08:26.996 --> 00:08:30.006
line between dinner and dessert.”

00:08:30.936 --> 00:08:31.626
End quote.

00:08:33.066 --> 00:08:35.916
Now, I must confess that I didn’t get the

00:08:35.916 --> 00:08:38.846
chance to try this, and although I like

00:08:38.866 --> 00:08:42.786
gravy and ice cream–or “gelato–I think

00:08:42.786 --> 00:08:45.576
I’m quite happy to keep the lines between

00:08:45.586 --> 00:08:48.536
dinner and dessert quite clearly defined.

00:08:49.326 --> 00:08:51.886
And judging by the fact that it was a

00:08:51.896 --> 00:08:54.486
limited release, and then nothing more

00:08:54.486 --> 00:08:57.296
was heard of it, my suspicion is that it

00:08:57.316 --> 00:09:00.256
tasted just as disgusting as it sounds.

00:09:01.216 --> 00:09:04.866
So there we go, even with our reputation

00:09:05.126 --> 00:09:06.886
for not being the world’s greatest

00:09:06.896 --> 00:09:09.886
food connoisseurs, the prospect of

00:09:09.916 --> 00:09:12.996
gravy-flavoured ice cream was too much

00:09:13.236 --> 00:09:15.766
even for the people of Great Britain.

00:09:16.956 --> 00:09:19.776
For story number three we will stay

00:09:19.786 --> 00:09:22.686
on the topic of food, but we’ll move

00:09:22.726 --> 00:09:25.206
into the surprisingly cut-throat

00:09:25.236 --> 00:09:28.466
world of competitive gardening, of

00:09:28.496 --> 00:09:30.586
people trying to grow the biggest

00:09:30.746 --> 00:09:32.696
or most beautiful vegetables.

00:09:33.626 --> 00:09:35.896
And if you have ever been to a village

00:09:35.906 --> 00:09:38.956
fair in the UK, you will know that

00:09:38.966 --> 00:09:41.456
these can be pretty serious affairs.

00:09:42.136 --> 00:09:45.196
And nowhere is it more serious than

00:09:45.196 --> 00:09:47.896
the CANNA National Giant Vegetables

00:09:47.896 --> 00:09:50.736
Championship, which is held every Autumn.

00:09:51.526 --> 00:09:54.356
This is like the Olympics for the

00:09:54.356 --> 00:09:56.166
professional vegetable growers

00:09:56.166 --> 00:09:59.356
of Britain, and 2025, it turns

00:09:59.356 --> 00:10:01.956
out, was a record-breaking year.

00:10:02.706 --> 00:10:05.906
Growers from across the country battled

00:10:05.906 --> 00:10:09.886
it out, and the event smashed six Guinness

00:10:09.916 --> 00:10:13.206
World Records for super-sized vegetables.

00:10:14.206 --> 00:10:16.896
One man claimed a record in both

00:10:16.966 --> 00:10:19.646
the longest aubergine category, with

00:10:19.646 --> 00:10:22.886
his 49 centimetre monster, and the

00:10:22.886 --> 00:10:25.426
tallest runner bean, which stretched

00:10:25.616 --> 00:10:28.166
more than 8 metres into the sky.

00:10:28.866 --> 00:10:32.076
A world-beating radish came in at 7.8

00:10:32.096 --> 00:10:35.956
metres, a sweet pepper at 26 centimetres,

00:10:36.346 --> 00:10:40.672
an 8 kilogramme celeriac, and at 4.39

00:10:40.672 --> 00:10:43.606
kilogrammes, the world’s heaviest tomato.

00:10:44.326 --> 00:10:47.606
But the star of the show was a

00:10:47.616 --> 00:10:49.786
squash, which had to be taken to

00:10:49.786 --> 00:10:52.006
the fair with a fork-lift truck.

00:10:52.896 --> 00:10:55.966
It weighed an astonishing 1.3

00:10:55.966 --> 00:10:58.366
tonnes, the equivalent of a

00:10:58.376 --> 00:11:00.766
Volkswagen Golf, a small car.

00:11:01.956 --> 00:11:04.546
It is quite something, and at

00:11:04.596 --> 00:11:07.119
its peak it required a whopping

00:11:07.616 --> 00:11:12.386
473 litres of water per day.

00:11:13.356 --> 00:11:15.136
Now, story number four

00:11:15.546 --> 00:11:16.846
is just plain weird.

00:11:17.836 --> 00:11:21.496
In October of this year, police in

00:11:21.496 --> 00:11:24.721
the Midlands city of Derby made an

00:11:24.721 --> 00:11:26.841
announcement that residents should

00:11:26.841 --> 00:11:29.261
stay vigilant because a crocodile

00:11:29.541 --> 00:11:31.631
had been spotted in a canal.

00:11:32.561 --> 00:11:34.661
Now, in case I need to clarify

00:11:34.661 --> 00:11:36.681
this, crocodiles do not

00:11:36.691 --> 00:11:39.131
naturally exist in the UK.

00:11:39.921 --> 00:11:42.811
Yes, you might be able to see one in

00:11:42.821 --> 00:11:45.421
the London Zoo, but no, you will not

00:11:45.501 --> 00:11:48.041
accidentally stumble across one when

00:11:48.221 --> 00:11:50.551
walking through the Scottish highlands, or

00:11:50.551 --> 00:11:52.781
in a canal in Derbyshire, for that matter.

00:11:53.921 --> 00:11:56.561
This being said, in October this year,

00:11:56.901 --> 00:11:59.701
the police received a call from several

00:11:59.871 --> 00:12:02.451
concerned residents saying that they

00:12:02.451 --> 00:12:04.821
had seen a crocodile in the canal.

00:12:06.341 --> 00:12:08.081
They presumably thought “what a

00:12:08.081 --> 00:12:10.301
load of rubbish”, and when they

00:12:10.301 --> 00:12:12.747
went to take a look, unsurprisingly,

00:12:13.001 --> 00:12:14.901
no crocodile could be found.

00:12:15.551 --> 00:12:17.641
But there were pictures of

00:12:17.641 --> 00:12:19.691
the croc, and it looked real.

00:12:20.551 --> 00:12:22.691
The police appealed to the public

00:12:22.701 --> 00:12:24.241
for information about the crocodile.

00:12:24.961 --> 00:12:26.501
Did someone dump it there?

00:12:27.051 --> 00:12:28.151
Was it still alive?

00:12:28.451 --> 00:12:30.466
Was it about to clamber out of

00:12:30.531 --> 00:12:33.131
the canal and wreak havoc through

00:12:33.131 --> 00:12:34.811
the calm streets of Derby?

00:12:36.111 --> 00:12:38.931
And for several days…the

00:12:38.931 --> 00:12:40.681
lines were silent.

00:12:41.321 --> 00:12:43.731
Nobody knew anything about it.

00:12:44.591 --> 00:12:47.011
Then, the mystery was solved.

00:12:47.261 --> 00:12:48.841
Or at least, sort of solved.

00:12:49.691 --> 00:12:51.311
The police announced that a

00:12:51.321 --> 00:12:53.491
local fisherman was surprised

00:12:53.491 --> 00:12:56.221
to find he had reeled in none

00:12:56.301 --> 00:12:58.471
other than the missing crocodile.

00:12:59.351 --> 00:13:01.801
And, surprise surprise, it was not

00:13:01.821 --> 00:13:04.231
a real crocodile; it was a stuffed

00:13:04.541 --> 00:13:06.731
model crocodile, filled with hay,

00:13:07.111 --> 00:13:10.481
but it did look uncannily realistic.

00:13:11.321 --> 00:13:14.181
To this day, however, nobody has

00:13:14.271 --> 00:13:16.411
owned up to chucking it in there,

00:13:16.671 --> 00:13:19.771
so the mystery remains unsolved.

00:13:20.651 --> 00:13:23.191
Now, unusual news item number

00:13:23.191 --> 00:13:25.131
five is really a collection

00:13:25.131 --> 00:13:27.141
of different unusual items.

00:13:27.791 --> 00:13:31.391
In January this year, a train operator

00:13:31.701 --> 00:13:34.571
released a statement with a list of all

00:13:34.581 --> 00:13:37.341
of the unusual items that had been left

00:13:37.361 --> 00:13:40.061
by passengers on their trains that year.

00:13:41.221 --> 00:13:43.331
The most common items will

00:13:43.341 --> 00:13:45.541
probably not surprise you: mobile

00:13:45.551 --> 00:13:47.931
phones, laptops, and wallets.

00:13:48.481 --> 00:13:51.321
But there were several items that

00:13:51.321 --> 00:13:54.371
certainly fit in the “unusual” category.

00:13:55.351 --> 00:13:59.371
Someone left behind 10 kilograms of

00:13:59.431 --> 00:14:02.461
raw chicken, which I should underline

00:14:02.751 --> 00:14:04.571
is not suspected of being connected

00:14:04.831 --> 00:14:06.771
to the invention of the KFC “gravy

00:14:06.771 --> 00:14:10.101
gelato”, but as to what someone was doing

00:14:10.101 --> 00:14:12.441
with 10 kilograms of raw chicken on a

00:14:12.441 --> 00:14:15.321
train, well, that is anyone’s guess.

00:14:16.291 --> 00:14:19.241
Someone also left behind a live hamster,

00:14:19.621 --> 00:14:22.361
another person left a prosthetic leg,

00:14:22.631 --> 00:14:25.041
while someone else left their wig.

00:14:25.761 --> 00:14:28.631
So, it just goes to show that those

00:14:28.671 --> 00:14:31.101
constant messages over the tannoy

00:14:31.381 --> 00:14:33.781
reminding passengers to “remember to

00:14:33.781 --> 00:14:35.311
take all of your belongings before you

00:14:35.311 --> 00:14:37.881
get off the train”, and “unattended

00:14:37.881 --> 00:14:40.581
belongings may be removed and destroyed”,

00:14:41.131 --> 00:14:43.671
well, they do serve a purpose.

00:14:44.401 --> 00:14:46.801
And if you are wondering whether the

00:14:46.801 --> 00:14:49.341
hamster was joyfully reunited with

00:14:49.341 --> 00:14:52.151
its owner, or it was, to use the

00:14:52.161 --> 00:14:54.391
official term used in those threatening

00:14:54.391 --> 00:14:57.361
messages, “destroyed”, unfortunately

00:14:57.361 --> 00:14:59.071
the press announcement did not say.

00:14:59.601 --> 00:15:02.401
Let’s assume it was a joyful reunion.

00:15:03.321 --> 00:15:06.391
And now, moving onto our final story

00:15:06.401 --> 00:15:09.191
of the day, this is actually one for

00:15:09.191 --> 00:15:11.851
the most dedicated of listeners, as

00:15:12.031 --> 00:15:14.441
you may remember that in a version

00:15:14.461 --> 00:15:17.041
of this “unusual British news” from

00:15:17.041 --> 00:15:20.241
a couple of years ago, in 2023, there

00:15:20.241 --> 00:15:22.901
was the story of a solid gold toilet

00:15:23.111 --> 00:15:25.741
being stolen from Blenheim Palace.

00:15:26.791 --> 00:15:29.161
This was a work by an Italian

00:15:29.201 --> 00:15:32.431
artist who had created a functioning

00:15:32.471 --> 00:15:35.131
toilet made out of solid gold.

00:15:35.771 --> 00:15:37.791
The gold alone was worth

00:15:37.821 --> 00:15:40.347
a reported $4 million.

00:15:41.451 --> 00:15:44.651
Although the museum manager had boasted

00:15:45.051 --> 00:15:46.981
that there was no need to guard it,

00:15:47.281 --> 00:15:49.661
because it was an actual toilet and

00:15:49.661 --> 00:15:52.121
therefore nobody would want to steal it,

00:15:52.691 --> 00:15:55.561
they proved to be mistaken, as the entire

00:15:55.561 --> 00:15:58.391
thing was ripped out of its plumbing.

00:15:59.491 --> 00:16:02.771
For several years, the thieves remained

00:16:02.861 --> 00:16:07.871
at large, but in 2023 two men were

00:16:07.901 --> 00:16:10.771
arrested and taken into custody.

00:16:11.901 --> 00:16:14.861
And this year they were finally sentenced.

00:16:15.981 --> 00:16:19.901
One, James Sheen, was a career criminal,

00:16:20.301 --> 00:16:23.421
but he fell into the trap many criminals

00:16:23.471 --> 00:16:26.411
seem to fall into, of sending pictures

00:16:26.571 --> 00:16:29.571
of large wads of cash and boasting

00:16:29.581 --> 00:16:31.531
about the theft to his friends.

00:16:32.191 --> 00:16:34.131
He was caught by the police, and

00:16:34.131 --> 00:16:36.901
this year he was sentenced to four

00:16:36.921 --> 00:16:39.021
years in prison, while another

00:16:39.021 --> 00:16:41.261
man was sentenced to two years.

00:16:42.341 --> 00:16:45.481
And as for the toilet, well, police

00:16:45.481 --> 00:16:48.101
believe it was melted down almost

00:16:48.101 --> 00:16:50.811
immediately, and the gold sold off

00:16:50.841 --> 00:16:52.921
to dealers up and down the country.

00:16:54.041 --> 00:16:57.271
During the trial, Sheen told the court

00:16:57.651 --> 00:16:59.731
that he had first visited the toilet

00:17:00.081 --> 00:17:03.171
as a paying customer, to inspect it.

00:17:04.141 --> 00:17:06.751
He also admitted that during the visit

00:17:07.141 --> 00:17:10.131
he had actually used the toilet for its

00:17:10.201 --> 00:17:13.281
intended purpose, and lightheartedly

00:17:13.491 --> 00:17:16.241
described the experience as "splendid".

00:17:17.161 --> 00:17:19.341
No doubt the facilities he will

00:17:19.351 --> 00:17:20.821
have to get used to in prison

00:17:21.321 --> 00:17:23.651
might be somewhat less shiny.

00:17:24.841 --> 00:17:27.421
OK, then, that is it for today's episode

00:17:27.701 --> 00:17:30.811
on the unusual British news of 2025.

00:17:31.233 --> 00:17:33.265
Lighthearted, goodnatured,

00:17:33.411 --> 00:17:35.041
and well and truly weird.

00:17:35.681 --> 00:17:38.211
And on that note, this is our last

00:17:38.241 --> 00:17:41.731
episode of 2025, so let me take this

00:17:41.731 --> 00:17:44.221
opportunity to thank you for your time,

00:17:44.521 --> 00:17:46.471
thank you for listening and being part

00:17:46.471 --> 00:17:48.361
of this weird and wonderful world,

00:17:48.601 --> 00:17:51.241
and you will hear from me next year.

00:17:52.061 --> 00:17:53.931
You've been listening to English Learning

00:17:53.931 --> 00:17:56.611
for Curious Minds by Leonardo English.

00:17:57.061 --> 00:17:59.771
I'm Alastair Budge, you stay safe, and

00:17:59.771 --> 00:18:01.931
I'll catch you in the next episode.
