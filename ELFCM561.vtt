Hello, hello, hello, and welcome

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.740
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.499
Minds, by Leonardo English, the show

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.120
where you can listen to fascinating

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.490
stories and learn weird and wonderful

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.469
things about the world at the same

00:00:18.469 --> 00:00:20.290
time as improving your English.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.450
I'm Alastair Budge, and today it’s part

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.060
two of our three-part mini-series on

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.960
the theme of citizenship and identity.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.339
In part one, in case you missed

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.659
it, we talked about the debate and

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.079
recent referendum in Italy on who

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.220
has the right to Italian citizenship.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.089
In part three, the next episode,

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.060
we’ll talk about the battle between

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.260
Malta and the European Union over

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.390
the right to sell citizenship.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.200
And in today’s episode, we are going

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.800
to talk about a recent scandal in

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.970
the UK, a scandal involving tens of

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.180
thousands of people who thought they

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.610
were British, had no reason to doubt

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.830
they were British citizens, but then

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.059
the government told them they weren’t.

00:01:05.599 --> 00:01:07.779
So, let’s not waste a minute,

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.529
and get right into it.

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:12.760
You may well have heard the

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.810
expression “the sun never

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.720
sets on the British Empire”.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.679
At its peak, in 1920, the British

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:24.830
Empire contained 35.5 million square

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.799
kilometres of territory, 26% of all

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.940
land on Earth, an area 170 times larger

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.300
than the size of Great Britain itself.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.539
For better or for worse, at various points

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.220
from the 16th century onwards, from the

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.920
Caribbean to West Africa, the Middle East

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.940
to Australia and the Pacific, the Union

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.720
Jack flew high and the local population

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.210
were subjects of a British monarch.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.080
One of the many things that this

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.300
meant was that, in theory at least,

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:02.559
these subjects shared a common legal

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.909
status under the Crown, with the

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.050
right to move and work across the

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.479
Empire, including Britain itself.

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.400
In practice, moving from one British

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.869
colony to another was much more difficult.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.050
First, there was the simple fact

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.840
that it was incredibly expensive.

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:25.390
Someone from Jamaica or India or Myanmar

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.980
couldn’t decide one day, “I think I’ll

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.170
try out life in Edinburgh”; the cost

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.170
of simply getting there would mean

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.249
they couldn’t even entertain the idea.

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:37.649
Second, racial prejudice and

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.230
discrimination often blocked their path.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.260
There were restrictions on free

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.460
movement, including permissions

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.460
or taxes to leave a country.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.940
And even if someone made it to Britain,

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.080
especially if they were not white,

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.359
they were often met with hostility,

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.270
from landlords refusing to rent them

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.080
rooms to employers turning them away.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.310
This meant that for the vast majority

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.890
of the existence of the British Empire,

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.239
free movement within it, and a shared

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.189
identity of “Britishness”, was really

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.900
a mirage, a nice idea in theory but

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.999
in practice it was something enjoyed

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.950
by a tiny fraction of the 400 or so

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.440
million people that were part of it.

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.100
This started to change

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:27.930
after the Second World War.

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:31.370
Britain, the so-called “Mother

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.599
country”, had lost half a million

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:35.530
people during the war, had been

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:38.359
badly bombed during the Blitz, and

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.020
was in desperate need of rebuilding.

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.250
The answer was right in front

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.299
of it, or rather, it was in

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.320
its many overseas territories.

00:03:49.644 --> 00:03:53.904
In 1948, Britain passed a new law creating

00:03:53.914 --> 00:03:56.974
a new status — Citizen of the United

00:03:56.974 --> 00:03:59.544
Kingdom and Colonies — which confirmed

00:03:59.544 --> 00:04:02.204
that people born in British colonies were

00:04:02.204 --> 00:04:05.034
legally recognised as British subjects.

00:04:05.894 --> 00:04:08.824
This meant that, at least in theory, the

00:04:08.834 --> 00:04:11.744
British Prime Minister and a farmer in

00:04:11.744 --> 00:04:15.034
rural Pakistan or Jamaica were equals

00:04:15.204 --> 00:04:17.824
in terms of their right to hold British

00:04:17.824 --> 00:04:20.924
citizenship and live and work in Britain.

00:04:22.191 --> 00:04:26.501
And so, in June of 1948, a ship called

00:04:26.521 --> 00:04:30.731
the HMT Empire Windrush arrived at

00:04:30.801 --> 00:04:33.051
Tilbury Docks, just east of London.

00:04:34.001 --> 00:04:37.391
On board were 1,027 passengers,

00:04:37.751 --> 00:04:40.351
mostly from Jamaica, coming to Britain

00:04:40.651 --> 00:04:43.361
to take up work and help rebuild a

00:04:43.361 --> 00:04:45.311
country still recovering from the

00:04:45.321 --> 00:04:47.401
devastation of the Second World War.

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.820
This arrival is often seen as the symbolic

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.700
beginning of what came to be known as

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.680
the Windrush generation, named after the

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.870
ship itself, the HMT Empire Windrush.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.510
In the years that followed, tens of

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.680
thousands more people arrived from

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.190
the Caribbean, from countries such as

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.070
Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, and others.

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.700
Many came in response to advertisements

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:18.130
encouraging Commonwealth citizens to

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.430
come and work in Britain, particularly

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.650
in sectors where there were severe

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:24.950
labour shortages: public transport,

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.710
manufacturing, construction, and the

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.090
newly created National Health Service.

00:05:31.467 --> 00:05:33.847
And of course, they came not necessarily

00:05:33.847 --> 00:05:36.577
out of charity or some patriotic

00:05:36.577 --> 00:05:38.807
sense of the need to rebuild Britain;

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:41.920
they came seeking a better life, for

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:43.930
themselves, and for their children.

00:05:45.277 --> 00:05:47.517
It’s worth stressing that these people

00:05:47.667 --> 00:05:49.947
were not coming as “immigrants” in the

00:05:49.947 --> 00:05:52.517
way we might understand that term today.

00:05:53.267 --> 00:05:54.977
Legally, they were British

00:05:55.017 --> 00:05:57.117
subjects, citizens of the

00:05:57.127 --> 00:05:58.547
United Kingdom and Colonies.

00:05:58.937 --> 00:06:01.407
Many travelled on British passports,

00:06:01.717 --> 00:06:04.407
and under the law at that time, they had

00:06:04.457 --> 00:06:06.677
every right to live and work in Britain.

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:09.920
That being said, the welcome they

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.720
received was often far from warm.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.690
Many faced open hostility,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.870
discrimination, and racism.

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.540
Landlords would refuse to rent to

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:22.500
them, employers would turn them away,

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:25.680
and finding decent housing or stable

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.710
work could be a daily struggle.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.360
There was a famous picture taken

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.400
of a sign in a window which read,

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.970
“No Irish, No Blacks, No Dogs.”

00:06:37.374 --> 00:06:40.294
Nevertheless, over time, many of

00:06:40.294 --> 00:06:42.984
those who arrived settled and built

00:06:42.994 --> 00:06:44.894
lives and communities in Britain.

00:06:45.604 --> 00:06:48.934
Britain became home, these people, this

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:52.024
“Windrush generation”, contributed to

00:06:52.024 --> 00:06:55.164
British society in countless ways: working

00:06:55.164 --> 00:06:57.234
in hospitals, driving buses, building

00:06:57.234 --> 00:07:00.194
homes, raising families, and leaving their

00:07:00.194 --> 00:07:03.024
mark on British culture through music,

00:07:03.314 --> 00:07:05.814
food, and traditions from the Caribbean.

00:07:06.874 --> 00:07:09.474
And this wasn’t a small number of people.

00:07:09.894 --> 00:07:13.534
Between 1948 and 1970, an estimated

00:07:13.544 --> 00:07:16.084
half a million people travelled from the

00:07:16.084 --> 00:07:18.614
Caribbean to live and work in Britain.

00:07:19.904 --> 00:07:22.204
And this was combined with millions of

00:07:22.224 --> 00:07:24.284
other immigrants from other countries,

00:07:24.524 --> 00:07:26.434
often former British colonies.

00:07:27.444 --> 00:07:30.934
By 1971, the foreign-born population of

00:07:30.944 --> 00:07:33.644
the United Kingdom reached more than 3

00:07:33.644 --> 00:07:37.344
million, 6.4% of the total population.

00:07:38.814 --> 00:07:40.794
To state the obvious, this was

00:07:40.794 --> 00:07:43.204
a big change, and during this

00:07:43.214 --> 00:07:45.604
time, public attitudes towards

00:07:45.634 --> 00:07:47.714
immigration started to shift.

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:51.070
Pressure built, particularly from

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:52.670
parts of the British public and

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:55.630
certain politicians, to limit further

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:57.030
immigration from the Commonwealth,

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.450
from former colonies that still

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:00.990
maintained close links to Britain.

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:04.670
This culminated with the Immigration

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:07.980
Act in 1971, which introduced the

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:10.510
idea of Indefinite Leave to Remain,

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:13.580
essentially granting permanent residency

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:16.270
to people already in Britain, but

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:19.100
making it clear that future immigration

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:21.580
would be subject to stricter control.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:25.550
For many of those who had already settled,

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:28.540
this legal shift didn’t affect their

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:31.020
daily lives at the time in the slightest.

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:33.290
They were already living and working

00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:35.750
in Britain, some had been doing so

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:38.640
for 20-plus years, and, perfectly

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.840
understandably, they assumed they

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:43.150
had every right to continue doing so.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:48.000
But crucially, many never received formal

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:51.050
documentation to prove their legal status.

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:54.140
They had arrived legally, under the

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:56.750
law at that time, and furthermore,

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:58.530
there was nothing requiring them

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:01.080
to register or carry proof of

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:02.510
their right to be in the country.

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:05.630
They worked, paid their taxes, bought

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:07.940
houses, voted in elections, had

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:09.820
children, and then grandchildren,

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:12.410
and were able to live and exist

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:15.020
like any other British citizen.

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:20.320
Then, in 2012, everything changed.

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:23.770
The British government, under Conservative

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:26.030
leadership, started to roll out a

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:29.190
new policy it called its “hostile

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:32.010
environment policy”, which promised to

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:34.240
clamp down on people who were living

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:36.230
illegally in the United Kingdom.

00:09:37.504 --> 00:09:40.394
This was all in response to an election

00:09:40.394 --> 00:09:44.034
pledge to reduce immigration and win over

00:09:44.034 --> 00:09:47.074
voters from parties like UKIP, which had

00:09:47.074 --> 00:09:49.684
an even harsher anti-immigration stance.

00:09:50.714 --> 00:09:52.994
The Home Office, which is the British

00:09:52.994 --> 00:09:55.114
department responsible for internal

00:09:55.114 --> 00:09:58.594
affairs–stuff like immigration, passports,

00:09:58.864 --> 00:10:01.444
public safety, and so on–it started to do

00:10:01.444 --> 00:10:04.644
things like send trucks around areas with

00:10:04.644 --> 00:10:07.314
high immigrant populations with big signs

00:10:07.314 --> 00:10:09.784
on telling people that if they are in the

00:10:09.784 --> 00:10:12.504
country illegally, they will be deported.

00:10:13.504 --> 00:10:15.924
But it wasn’t just about making illegal

00:10:15.934 --> 00:10:18.484
immigrants feel uncomfortable in Britain;

00:10:19.174 --> 00:10:21.974
the government also introduced a series

00:10:21.974 --> 00:10:24.184
of new rules that made it harder for

00:10:24.184 --> 00:10:26.614
anyone without clear documentation

00:10:26.914 --> 00:10:28.824
to live and work in the country.

00:10:29.674 --> 00:10:31.744
Landlords were required to

00:10:31.744 --> 00:10:33.704
check the immigration status of

00:10:33.704 --> 00:10:35.454
tenants before renting to them.

00:10:35.844 --> 00:10:38.004
Banks had to verify a

00:10:38.034 --> 00:10:39.524
customer's immigration status

00:10:39.784 --> 00:10:41.044
before opening an account.

00:10:41.344 --> 00:10:44.434
Employers had to confirm that someone had

00:10:44.434 --> 00:10:46.664
the legal right to work in the country.

00:10:47.304 --> 00:10:49.534
Even access to healthcare was

00:10:49.544 --> 00:10:51.424
restricted if someone couldn’t

00:10:51.464 --> 00:10:53.174
prove their legal status.

00:10:54.064 --> 00:10:56.184
Essentially, if you didn’t have the

00:10:56.184 --> 00:10:58.854
legal right to be in the country, you

00:10:58.854 --> 00:11:01.694
were cut off from most major services.

00:11:02.224 --> 00:11:04.374
Your ability to exist comfortably,

00:11:04.834 --> 00:11:07.114
or even exist at all, was

00:11:07.114 --> 00:11:08.844
made an awful lot harder.

00:11:09.824 --> 00:11:12.434
For those living in the country illegally,

00:11:12.784 --> 00:11:15.464
it was a hostile environment indeed.

00:11:16.887 --> 00:11:20.187
Now, this policy enjoyed relatively

00:11:20.187 --> 00:11:21.997
high public support at the time.

00:11:22.747 --> 00:11:25.627
After all, its intended target was

00:11:25.997 --> 00:11:28.457
illegal immigrants, people who didn’t

00:11:28.467 --> 00:11:30.687
have a legal right to be in the country.

00:11:31.717 --> 00:11:34.627
And the vast majority of immigrants in

00:11:34.627 --> 00:11:38.387
the UK, both then and now, are not illegal

00:11:38.397 --> 00:11:40.707
immigrants; they are legal immigrants.

00:11:40.767 --> 00:11:43.117
They have clear documentation: a

00:11:43.377 --> 00:11:45.537
passport or a residence permit.

00:11:46.747 --> 00:11:49.727
So when these new rules came in, they

00:11:49.727 --> 00:11:51.637
might have been a bit annoying because

00:11:51.887 --> 00:11:53.787
you’d have to go and make a photocopy

00:11:53.787 --> 00:11:56.367
or update your documents, but they

00:11:56.367 --> 00:11:58.077
were little more than a formality.

00:11:59.294 --> 00:12:01.493
For many members of the Windrush

00:12:01.503 --> 00:12:03.973
generation, however, who had arrived

00:12:03.983 --> 00:12:06.833
legally decades earlier but had

00:12:06.843 --> 00:12:08.903
never been issued formal papers,

00:12:08.933 --> 00:12:11.023
or had any inclination that they

00:12:11.023 --> 00:12:13.453
would ever need them, these rules

00:12:13.943 --> 00:12:15.913
suddenly became a huge problem.

00:12:16.763 --> 00:12:19.743
People who had lived in Britain for fifty

00:12:19.743 --> 00:12:22.183
or sixty years were now being asked to

00:12:22.243 --> 00:12:24.483
prove that they had the right to be there.

00:12:25.803 --> 00:12:27.373
And many…couldn’t.

00:12:28.573 --> 00:12:30.953
This “hostile environment” policy

00:12:31.183 --> 00:12:33.173
was incredibly hostile indeed.

00:12:34.183 --> 00:12:36.713
People were asked to provide documents

00:12:36.943 --> 00:12:39.453
such as payslips, utility bills,

00:12:39.453 --> 00:12:42.093
or job contracts for every single

00:12:42.093 --> 00:12:43.843
year they'd been in the country.

00:12:45.063 --> 00:12:47.293
Perfectly understandably, many

00:12:47.293 --> 00:12:49.443
people couldn’t do this; they had

00:12:49.483 --> 00:12:51.633
thrown away electricity bills from

00:12:51.643 --> 00:12:54.464
1963 and hadn’t bothered to keep

00:12:54.464 --> 00:12:56.956
their bank statements from 1981.

00:12:57.864 --> 00:12:59.874
So they didn’t have any form of

00:13:00.094 --> 00:13:02.604
official documentation proving

00:13:02.774 --> 00:13:03.934
that they'd been in the country.

00:13:05.524 --> 00:13:07.934
To make matters worse, it turned out

00:13:08.174 --> 00:13:11.254
that in 2010, two years before the

00:13:11.254 --> 00:13:13.064
“hostile environment” policy came into

00:13:13.064 --> 00:13:15.884
place, in the name of digitalisation

00:13:15.904 --> 00:13:18.754
and efficiency, the Home Office had

00:13:18.774 --> 00:13:21.164
destroyed thousands of landing cards,

00:13:21.364 --> 00:13:23.704
the paper cards with the names and

00:13:23.714 --> 00:13:25.984
dates of people who arrived in the UK.

00:13:27.464 --> 00:13:30.634
This was part of a supposedly routine

00:13:30.704 --> 00:13:33.314
clean-up of public records, but

00:13:33.914 --> 00:13:36.184
for many, it was the last remaining

00:13:36.184 --> 00:13:38.064
piece of evidence that they had come

00:13:38.064 --> 00:13:40.184
to the UK legally, and therefore

00:13:40.404 --> 00:13:42.154
had every right to be there.

00:13:43.604 --> 00:13:46.624
And without the right documents, people

00:13:46.834 --> 00:13:48.734
found themselves considered to be

00:13:48.734 --> 00:13:51.578
illegal immigrants, unwitting victims

00:13:51.778 --> 00:13:53.848
of this “hostile environment” policy.

00:13:54.728 --> 00:13:57.298
They were unable to work, unable to

00:13:57.298 --> 00:13:59.908
rent homes or even evicted from their

00:13:59.908 --> 00:14:02.588
home, denied access to healthcare or

00:14:02.628 --> 00:14:05.288
benefits, unable to open bank accounts,

00:14:05.588 --> 00:14:08.338
or even threatened with deportation.

00:14:09.518 --> 00:14:11.748
Some people were detained and

00:14:11.758 --> 00:14:13.914
held in immigration centres.

00:14:14.634 --> 00:14:17.098
A few were wrongly deported to countries

00:14:17.098 --> 00:14:19.728
they had never been to, despite having

00:14:19.728 --> 00:14:22.058
spent their entire adult lives in Britain.

00:14:23.348 --> 00:14:25.388
The scandal eventually came to

00:14:25.388 --> 00:14:29.348
public attention in 2017 and 2018,

00:14:29.348 --> 00:14:31.788
when newspapers, campaigners, and

00:14:31.788 --> 00:14:34.478
lawyers began to highlight case after

00:14:34.478 --> 00:14:36.948
case of people being mistreated.

00:14:38.235 --> 00:14:40.965
One widely reported case was that

00:14:40.985 --> 00:14:43.255
of a lady called Paulette Wilson.

00:14:44.375 --> 00:14:47.475
She had arrived in Britain from Jamaica as

00:14:47.475 --> 00:14:51.515
a 10-year-old in 1968, worked for decades

00:14:51.515 --> 00:14:54.435
in Britain, raised a family, was a mother

00:14:54.605 --> 00:14:57.775
and a grandmother, and even worked in

00:14:57.775 --> 00:15:00.525
the House of Commons canteen, cooking for

00:15:00.525 --> 00:15:02.985
prime ministers and members of parliament.

00:15:04.535 --> 00:15:08.655
In 2016, nearly fifty years after

00:15:08.685 --> 00:15:11.565
arriving in Britain, a letter popped

00:15:11.575 --> 00:15:14.395
through her door informing her that she'd

00:15:14.395 --> 00:15:17.075
broken the law, and she had been found

00:15:17.205 --> 00:15:19.435
to be living in the country illegally.

00:15:20.818 --> 00:15:22.618
She was told that she needed

00:15:22.618 --> 00:15:25.478
to pack her bags and return to

00:15:25.478 --> 00:15:27.828
her “home country” of Jamaica.

00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:32.178
But Jamaica wasn’t “home”; she left as

00:15:32.178 --> 00:15:34.428
a 10-year-old and had never been back.

00:15:35.638 --> 00:15:38.008
And to underline, she had come to the

00:15:38.018 --> 00:15:41.418
UK completely legally, and up until that

00:15:41.418 --> 00:15:43.578
moment, she had no idea that she was

00:15:43.628 --> 00:15:45.948
anything other than a British citizen.

00:15:46.828 --> 00:15:48.448
She was taken away in a van

00:15:48.665 --> 00:15:49.895
to an immigration centre

00:15:50.115 --> 00:15:51.655
where she was held for a week.

00:15:52.515 --> 00:15:54.315
She was about to be put on a plane

00:15:54.535 --> 00:15:57.785
and sent to Jamaica, and were it not

00:15:57.795 --> 00:15:59.795
for a last-minute intervention from

00:15:59.795 --> 00:16:02.755
her MP, her Member of Parliament, she

00:16:02.755 --> 00:16:04.855
would have been deported from Britain.

00:16:06.152 --> 00:16:09.092
And she was far from the only case.

00:16:09.952 --> 00:16:11.582
As more stories emerged,

00:16:11.972 --> 00:16:13.142
public anger grew.

00:16:13.852 --> 00:16:16.142
The government was accused of failing

00:16:16.142 --> 00:16:17.982
to properly document people’s legal

00:16:17.982 --> 00:16:20.432
rights, of creating impossible

00:16:20.452 --> 00:16:23.342
demands for proof, and of targeting

00:16:23.342 --> 00:16:25.542
people who had every reason to

00:16:25.542 --> 00:16:27.632
believe they were British citizens.

00:16:28.872 --> 00:16:31.282
And given that the vast majority of

00:16:31.282 --> 00:16:33.762
those affected were of Black Caribbean

00:16:33.762 --> 00:16:35.852
heritage, there were also questions

00:16:35.852 --> 00:16:38.072
raised about structural racism.

00:16:39.492 --> 00:16:41.852
The political fallout was swift.

00:16:42.992 --> 00:16:45.542
Amber Rudd, who was then the Home

00:16:45.542 --> 00:16:49.072
Secretary, resigned in 2018 after

00:16:49.102 --> 00:16:50.992
admitting that the Home Office had

00:16:50.992 --> 00:16:53.812
set internal targets for deportations.

00:16:54.682 --> 00:16:57.042
Theresa May, who was Home Secretary

00:16:57.242 --> 00:16:58.752
when the policy was introduced

00:16:58.772 --> 00:17:00.322
but had since been made Prime

00:17:00.322 --> 00:17:02.752
Minister, issued a public apology.

00:17:03.662 --> 00:17:05.932
The government created what it called

00:17:06.092 --> 00:17:08.642
the Windrush Compensation Scheme to

00:17:08.642 --> 00:17:11.162
try to compensate those affected.

00:17:12.152 --> 00:17:15.482
But this too has been heavily criticised.

00:17:16.112 --> 00:17:18.302
There were long delays in processing

00:17:18.302 --> 00:17:21.092
cases, the application process was

00:17:21.122 --> 00:17:24.192
complicated, and even if they were deemed

00:17:24.222 --> 00:17:26.942
entitled to compensation, they often

00:17:26.942 --> 00:17:29.492
received far less than they expected.

00:17:30.052 --> 00:17:32.722
People got payouts of a few hundred or

00:17:32.892 --> 00:17:35.432
a few thousand pounds, which might not

00:17:35.432 --> 00:17:39.102
sound so bad, but are trivial when you

00:17:39.102 --> 00:17:41.152
consider the fact that they were unable

00:17:41.152 --> 00:17:43.452
to work or claim unemployment benefits

00:17:43.612 --> 00:17:45.892
while their cases were being investigated.

00:17:46.892 --> 00:17:49.012
Some died before receiving

00:17:49.072 --> 00:17:50.112
any payment at all.

00:17:51.382 --> 00:17:53.672
For many observers, the Windrush

00:17:53.672 --> 00:17:56.612
scandal became not just a question of

00:17:56.822 --> 00:17:59.402
administrative failure or bureaucratic

00:17:59.402 --> 00:18:02.182
mistakes, but something much deeper:

00:18:02.752 --> 00:18:05.122
a reflection of how Britain struggles

00:18:05.132 --> 00:18:06.592
with questions of citizenship,

00:18:06.992 --> 00:18:09.542
identity, and its colonial past.

00:18:10.712 --> 00:18:13.872
Because at the heart of this scandal is

00:18:13.932 --> 00:18:16.612
a simple question: what does it mean to

00:18:16.612 --> 00:18:19.462
be British, or indeed from any country?

00:18:20.212 --> 00:18:23.302
I am British–I have British citizenship

00:18:23.562 --> 00:18:26.312
through both my parents–but I have

00:18:26.312 --> 00:18:28.762
lived in Britain for a much lower

00:18:28.762 --> 00:18:31.122
percentage of my life compared to many

00:18:31.122 --> 00:18:33.432
of the victims of the Windrush scandal.

00:18:34.082 --> 00:18:36.812
My kids have never lived in Britain,

00:18:37.572 --> 00:18:39.962
and unless they do, they will probably

00:18:39.972 --> 00:18:41.872
never consider themselves British,

00:18:42.462 --> 00:18:44.742
yet they have British passports.

00:18:46.198 --> 00:18:49.028
But people like Paulette Wilson never

00:18:49.028 --> 00:18:50.968
considered herself to be anything

00:18:51.038 --> 00:18:53.328
other than British, nobody who knew

00:18:53.328 --> 00:18:55.138
her would have said she was anything

00:18:55.138 --> 00:18:57.778
other than British, yet she found

00:18:57.778 --> 00:18:59.708
that her government, or at least

00:18:59.978 --> 00:19:01.818
what she had considered to be her

00:19:01.818 --> 00:19:04.508
government, decided she was not.

00:19:05.618 --> 00:19:07.948
Fortunately, the mistreatment was

00:19:07.948 --> 00:19:10.358
so great, and the number of people

00:19:10.358 --> 00:19:12.888
affected so large, that this scandal

00:19:13.138 --> 00:19:16.308
did not go unnoticed, and the wrongs

00:19:16.588 --> 00:19:18.708
have at least been partially righted.

00:19:20.008 --> 00:19:21.973
The scandal is an uncomfortable

00:19:21.973 --> 00:19:24.973
reminder that even in a country with

00:19:24.983 --> 00:19:27.263
long-established legal traditions like

00:19:27.263 --> 00:19:30.123
Britain, the gap between who you feel

00:19:30.123 --> 00:19:33.543
you are and who the law says you are

00:19:34.063 --> 00:19:36.813
can sometimes be dangerously wide.

00:19:38.733 --> 00:19:40.953
OK, then, that is it for today's

00:19:40.953 --> 00:19:43.383
episode on The Windrush Scandal.

00:19:43.873 --> 00:19:45.153
I hope it's been an interesting one

00:19:45.383 --> 00:19:47.093
and that you've learnt something new.

00:19:47.753 --> 00:19:50.673
As a quick reminder, this is part two

00:19:50.683 --> 00:19:53.013
of a three-part mini-series on the

00:19:53.023 --> 00:19:55.533
theme of citizenship and identity.

00:19:55.963 --> 00:19:58.083
In part one, the last episode,

00:19:58.373 --> 00:19:59.643
we talked about the question

00:19:59.783 --> 00:20:01.523
of what makes an Italian.

00:20:01.853 --> 00:20:04.173
And next up, in part three, we will

00:20:04.213 --> 00:20:06.173
talk about a different way to become a

00:20:06.173 --> 00:20:08.963
citizen: by paying a fat chunk of money,

00:20:09.473 --> 00:20:11.753
and one small country’s battle with the

00:20:11.763 --> 00:20:14.533
EU for the right to continue doing so.

00:20:15.683 --> 00:20:17.783
You've been listening to English Learning

00:20:17.783 --> 00:20:20.433
for Curious Minds by Leonardo English.

00:20:21.023 --> 00:20:23.833
I'm Alastair Budge, you stay safe, and

00:20:23.833 --> 00:20:26.123
I'll catch you in the next episode.
