Hello, hello, hello, and welcome

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.039
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:12.749
Minds, by Leonardo English, the show

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:14.439
where you can listen to fascinating

00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:16.889
stories and learn weird and wonderful

00:00:16.899 --> 00:00:18.889
things about the world at the same

00:00:18.889 --> 00:00:20.669
time as improving your English.

00:00:21.129 --> 00:00:24.049
I’m Alastair Budge, and today it’s part

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:27.019
two of our three-part mini-series on

00:00:27.049 --> 00:00:29.529
“power struggles in post-colonial Africa”.

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:32.049
In case you missed it, in part one,

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:34.799
we looked at Mobutu Sese Seko, the

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:36.729
leopard-skin-hat-wearing dictator

00:00:36.959 --> 00:00:38.859
who ruled the Democratic Republic of

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:41.399
Congo for more than three decades.

00:00:41.779 --> 00:00:44.309
Next up, in part three, we’ll be

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.739
looking at the Angolan Model and

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.059
the mechanics of how China is

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.969
building Angola in exchange for oil.

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:54.739
Today, though, in part two, we are

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:56.789
going to talk about a man called

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:59.759
Simon Mann and a plot to overthrow

00:00:59.779 --> 00:01:01.859
the leader of Equatorial Guinea.

00:01:02.448 --> 00:01:05.458
It's a story almost too theatrical to

00:01:05.458 --> 00:01:08.104
be true, involving mercenaries, the

00:01:08.104 --> 00:01:10.144
most prestigious and expensive school

00:01:10.144 --> 00:01:12.814
in Britain, the son of a British prime

00:01:12.814 --> 00:01:15.094
minister, King Juan Carlos of Spain,

00:01:15.314 --> 00:01:17.814
Chelsea mansions, a notorious prison,

00:01:18.064 --> 00:01:20.484
oil, offshore bank accounts, grenade

00:01:20.494 --> 00:01:23.204
launchers, helicopters and more.

00:01:23.534 --> 00:01:25.774
So, let’s not waste a minute

00:01:26.084 --> 00:01:27.794
and get right into it.

00:01:29.444 --> 00:01:32.574
If I asked you to close your eyes and

00:01:32.604 --> 00:01:35.464
picture the protagonists of a military

00:01:35.464 --> 00:01:38.884
coup in an oil-rich West African nation, I

00:01:38.884 --> 00:01:41.844
imagine certain images might come to mind.

00:01:42.794 --> 00:01:45.534
Perhaps a fierce-looking man with a

00:01:45.544 --> 00:01:49.034
beret and an AK-47 hanging by his side.

00:01:49.684 --> 00:01:51.674
Groups of disgruntled young

00:01:51.674 --> 00:01:53.754
soldiers sitting nonchalantly

00:01:53.974 --> 00:01:56.484
on 4x4s, smoking cigarettes.

00:01:57.034 --> 00:01:59.074
Perhaps even someone like Mobutu

00:01:59.074 --> 00:02:01.774
Sese Seko, a tall man with a

00:02:01.784 --> 00:02:04.444
leopard-skin cap, large sunglasses,

00:02:04.544 --> 00:02:06.814
and an ebony cane by his side.

00:02:08.054 --> 00:02:10.554
Perhaps you might not imagine two

00:02:10.584 --> 00:02:13.424
English men in their early 50s, one

00:02:13.424 --> 00:02:15.864
of whom had gone to Eton College, the

00:02:16.124 --> 00:02:18.504
same elite private school as Princes

00:02:18.504 --> 00:02:21.144
William and Harry, and the other being

00:02:21.144 --> 00:02:23.544
the son of a British Prime Minister.

00:02:24.284 --> 00:02:26.464
Yet these were two of the key

00:02:26.464 --> 00:02:28.674
figures behind today’s story,

00:02:29.064 --> 00:02:31.174
the plot to overthrow the

00:02:31.174 --> 00:02:33.274
president of Equatorial Guinea.

00:02:34.164 --> 00:02:36.074
The men’s names were Simon

00:02:36.084 --> 00:02:38.614
Mann and Mark Thatcher.

00:02:39.254 --> 00:02:42.694
Yes, Thatcher as in Margaret Thatcher, the

00:02:42.694 --> 00:02:46.644
British Prime Minister from 1979 to 1990.

00:02:47.774 --> 00:02:49.994
Let’s start with Simon Mann.

00:02:51.224 --> 00:02:54.244
He was born in 1952 into a

00:02:54.254 --> 00:02:56.674
world of money and privilege.

00:02:57.374 --> 00:02:59.394
His father was a major in the

00:02:59.404 --> 00:03:02.084
British Army, and his grandfather

00:03:02.334 --> 00:03:04.824
had co-founded an engineering firm

00:03:05.104 --> 00:03:07.144
that eventually became part of one

00:03:07.144 --> 00:03:09.884
of the UK’s largest brewing empires.

00:03:10.834 --> 00:03:13.394
This wasn’t just upper-middle-class

00:03:13.414 --> 00:03:15.724
comfort; this was old money,

00:03:15.814 --> 00:03:18.004
old connections, the very top

00:03:18.194 --> 00:03:19.794
of the British upper class.

00:03:20.964 --> 00:03:24.584
This, naturally, led him to Eton College.

00:03:25.234 --> 00:03:28.044
Now, as a quick side note, I made an

00:03:28.064 --> 00:03:30.707
episode about Eton, it’s episode number

00:03:30.794 --> 00:03:33.184
407, if you’d like to listen to that one.

00:03:33.714 --> 00:03:36.854
If you know nothing about Eton, it is

00:03:36.854 --> 00:03:38.774
one of the most prestigious schools

00:03:38.784 --> 00:03:41.474
in Britain, perhaps even in the world.

00:03:42.204 --> 00:03:44.284
It’s the educational destination of

00:03:44.284 --> 00:03:46.584
choice for the British royal family,

00:03:46.844 --> 00:03:49.224
but also royals from all over the world,

00:03:49.424 --> 00:03:51.754
as well as the British aristocracy.

00:03:52.774 --> 00:03:56.464
Now, Simon Mann, by all accounts, wasn’t

00:03:56.504 --> 00:03:59.514
a particularly diligent student, and

00:03:59.754 --> 00:04:02.104
after finishing school, he went to the

00:04:02.104 --> 00:04:04.944
Royal Military Academy of Sandhurst,

00:04:05.084 --> 00:04:07.564
where British Army officers are trained.

00:04:08.574 --> 00:04:10.804
Soldiering, it seemed, was a

00:04:10.834 --> 00:04:13.254
profession that he was well-suited

00:04:13.254 --> 00:04:16.124
to, and he eventually joined the

00:04:16.144 --> 00:04:19.674
elite Special Air Service, or SAS.

00:04:20.744 --> 00:04:23.964
Now the SAS is essentially the

00:04:24.174 --> 00:04:26.966
British Special Forces, and is known

00:04:26.966 --> 00:04:29.586
for its brutal selection process and

00:04:29.786 --> 00:04:32.056
its highly specialised operations.

00:04:32.421 --> 00:04:34.721
They’re the elite soldiers who are

00:04:34.721 --> 00:04:37.561
flown in for particularly dangerous

00:04:37.561 --> 00:04:40.091
or difficult missions, the seriously

00:04:40.151 --> 00:04:42.671
hairy stuff, the stuff they can’t tell

00:04:42.671 --> 00:04:44.641
their friends or family anything about.

00:04:45.421 --> 00:04:48.441
This was Mann’s life for the best part

00:04:48.521 --> 00:04:52.231
of 10 years, but in 1981, at the age

00:04:52.231 --> 00:04:55.641
of 29, he decided enough was enough.

00:04:56.431 --> 00:04:58.781
He left the forces and started

00:04:58.811 --> 00:05:00.471
to look for new opportunities.

00:05:01.113 --> 00:05:03.036
And this is where the

00:05:03.036 --> 00:05:05.346
story gets a little murky.

00:05:06.256 --> 00:05:08.306
Like many former special forces

00:05:08.356 --> 00:05:11.386
operatives, Mann transitioned into the

00:05:11.386 --> 00:05:14.106
world of private military contracting.

00:05:14.646 --> 00:05:18.016
He became a mercenary, a gun for hire.

00:05:19.006 --> 00:05:22.106
He saw conflict zones not as theatres

00:05:22.106 --> 00:05:25.216
of war, but as business opportunities.

00:05:26.246 --> 00:05:28.056
He co-founded a company called

00:05:28.086 --> 00:05:31.086
Executive Outcomes with a former officer

00:05:31.276 --> 00:05:33.096
in South Africa’s special forces.

00:05:34.146 --> 00:05:37.386
And this company was essentially a

00:05:37.386 --> 00:05:39.496
group of private soldiers who would

00:05:39.506 --> 00:05:42.626
be sent into warzones, fighting on

00:05:42.626 --> 00:05:44.746
behalf of whoever paid their invoices,

00:05:45.086 --> 00:05:47.606
without asking too many questions

00:05:47.847 --> 00:05:49.476
about where the money came from.

00:05:50.346 --> 00:05:53.026
They were well-armed, well-trained,

00:05:53.336 --> 00:05:55.756
and available to the highest bidder.

00:05:57.046 --> 00:05:59.696
Now, here isn’t the time to go into

00:05:59.966 --> 00:06:01.964
everything that they did, and of course,

00:06:02.294 --> 00:06:04.904
a lot of it is still not publicly known,

00:06:05.314 --> 00:06:07.474
but they made a name for themselves

00:06:07.794 --> 00:06:10.320
first in Angola, and then in Sierra

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.100
Leone, supporting the government

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.480
forces against various rebel groups.

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:17.290
They were very effective, and

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.800
these contracts also turned

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:22.840
Simon Mann into a very rich man.

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.230
Along the way, he had become a key figure

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:29.180
in this new world of corporate warfare.

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:32.010
He was charming, well-connected,

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:34.620
and increasingly ambitious.

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.390
He began mixing with financiers, oil

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:41.077
executives, and political fixers.

00:06:42.055 --> 00:06:44.354
And someone he got to know, as

00:06:44.624 --> 00:06:46.854
they both ran in similar circles

00:06:47.054 --> 00:06:49.704
in South Africa, was Mark Thatcher.

00:06:50.466 --> 00:06:52.154
And yes, again, that is the

00:06:52.154 --> 00:06:54.244
son of Margaret Thatcher.

00:06:55.514 --> 00:06:58.114
Mark Thatcher had had a string of

00:06:58.244 --> 00:07:00.804
failed business ventures and had

00:07:00.834 --> 00:07:03.634
come under scrutiny for his apparent

00:07:03.824 --> 00:07:06.264
exploitation of his mother’s position

00:07:06.604 --> 00:07:08.524
for his own financial interests.

00:07:09.574 --> 00:07:11.704
In other words, he was involved in all

00:07:11.704 --> 00:07:14.444
sorts of slightly dubious and dodgy

00:07:14.474 --> 00:07:17.404
business dealings, and had a reputation

00:07:17.414 --> 00:07:20.274
in Britain for being up to no good.

00:07:21.144 --> 00:07:24.679
Now, fast forward to 2003.

00:07:25.864 --> 00:07:28.234
Simon Mann was contacted, he

00:07:28.234 --> 00:07:30.464
says, by a wealthy Lebanese

00:07:30.474 --> 00:07:32.545
businessman called Ely Calil.

00:07:33.594 --> 00:07:36.234
Calil had made a fortune, hundreds

00:07:36.234 --> 00:07:38.134
of millions of dollars, buying

00:07:38.144 --> 00:07:40.514
and selling oil in West Africa.

00:07:41.644 --> 00:07:43.684
Or to be precise, it’s a little

00:07:43.744 --> 00:07:46.214
unclear exactly how he made his money,

00:07:46.284 --> 00:07:48.674
but he claimed it was through oil.

00:07:49.894 --> 00:07:52.824
Anyway, Calil called up Simon Mann

00:07:53.074 --> 00:07:55.134
and told him to come immediately

00:07:55.384 --> 00:07:57.974
to his grand mansion in Chelsea.

00:07:58.594 --> 00:08:00.834
There was something he needed to tell him.

00:08:02.284 --> 00:08:05.964
When Mann arrived, Calil told him about

00:08:06.024 --> 00:08:08.724
an opportunity in Equatorial Guinea.

00:08:09.654 --> 00:08:12.394
Now, as a brief bit of background,

00:08:12.752 --> 00:08:15.744
Equatorial Guinea is a tiny country on

00:08:15.744 --> 00:08:18.504
the west coast of Central Africa, with

00:08:18.504 --> 00:08:20.994
a population of just over a million.

00:08:22.214 --> 00:08:25.684
It is a former Spanish colony, but for

00:08:25.694 --> 00:08:28.344
most of its post-independence history, it

00:08:28.354 --> 00:08:31.974
has been ruled by one man: Teodoro Obiang.

00:08:33.614 --> 00:08:35.954
For the first few years of independence,

00:08:36.214 --> 00:08:39.294
the country remained poor and isolated.

00:08:39.714 --> 00:08:43.364
But in the 1990s, everything changed.

00:08:44.224 --> 00:08:46.524
Vast offshore oil reserves were

00:08:46.524 --> 00:08:48.704
discovered, and suddenly, the

00:08:48.724 --> 00:08:51.054
country was flush with cash.

00:08:51.894 --> 00:08:54.314
By the early 2000s, it had one of the

00:08:54.314 --> 00:08:57.044
highest GDPs per capita in Africa.

00:08:57.594 --> 00:09:01.184
But, as you might expect, almost none of

00:09:01.184 --> 00:09:03.794
that wealth reached the average citizen.

00:09:04.544 --> 00:09:07.194
Most of it was controlled by the president

00:09:07.234 --> 00:09:10.104
and his family, particularly his son,

00:09:10.504 --> 00:09:13.274
Teodorín, who became infamous for his

00:09:13.284 --> 00:09:16.754
luxury lifestyle: mansions, supercars,

00:09:16.974 --> 00:09:19.244
private jets, all of the things you

00:09:19.244 --> 00:09:21.664
might expect from the son of a dictator.

00:09:22.704 --> 00:09:24.514
And Equatorial Guinea

00:09:24.604 --> 00:09:26.154
was a one-party state.

00:09:26.654 --> 00:09:28.914
Other parties were allowed in

00:09:28.924 --> 00:09:31.194
theory, but not in practice.

00:09:32.064 --> 00:09:34.044
Now, back to Ely Calil’s

00:09:34.094 --> 00:09:37.230
Chelsea mansion in 2003.

00:09:37.484 --> 00:09:39.614
Calil told Mann that he had been

00:09:39.654 --> 00:09:42.264
contacted by someone called Severo

00:09:42.264 --> 00:09:44.934
Moto, who was the exiled leader of

00:09:44.934 --> 00:09:47.184
the opposition in Equatorial Guinea.

00:09:48.624 --> 00:09:51.734
Moto had sought Calil’s help in financing

00:09:51.744 --> 00:09:55.104
a coup to overthrow the ageing Obiang.

00:09:56.224 --> 00:09:58.094
And Calil knew the man

00:09:58.104 --> 00:10:00.214
to go to: Simon Mann.

00:10:01.784 --> 00:10:03.604
Calil told Mann about the plot,

00:10:04.204 --> 00:10:06.214
claiming—according to Mann—that

00:10:06.854 --> 00:10:09.754
King Juan Carlos of Spain and the

00:10:09.764 --> 00:10:11.813
then Spanish Prime Minister, José

00:10:11.813 --> 00:10:14.634
María Aznar, both supported it.

00:10:16.045 --> 00:10:18.895
Calil has denied his involvement, and

00:10:19.095 --> 00:10:21.105
there’s no hard evidence confirming

00:10:21.105 --> 00:10:23.545
Spanish backing, so it’s possible

00:10:23.555 --> 00:10:25.955
Mann or Calil exaggerated this.

00:10:26.875 --> 00:10:29.205
Still, the plan was attractive

00:10:29.205 --> 00:10:31.385
enough for Mann to proceed.

00:10:32.345 --> 00:10:34.265
Of course, neither Calil nor

00:10:34.285 --> 00:10:35.965
Mann were doing this out of

00:10:35.965 --> 00:10:37.295
the goodness of their hearts.

00:10:37.945 --> 00:10:40.505
Mann would later say that he was attracted

00:10:40.505 --> 00:10:43.175
by the adventure of the mission, and

00:10:43.475 --> 00:10:45.555
thought that overthrowing a corrupt and

00:10:45.565 --> 00:10:47.705
brutal dictator would surely be a good

00:10:47.705 --> 00:10:49.925
thing for the people of Equatorial Guinea.

00:10:50.995 --> 00:10:53.385
But more than this, it would be

00:10:53.385 --> 00:10:55.885
a fabulous financial windfall.

00:10:56.905 --> 00:10:59.719
Not only would he be paid handsomely

00:10:59.925 --> 00:11:03.288
for pulling off the coup, but he and his

00:11:03.288 --> 00:11:06.425
conspirators stood to gain oil and mining

00:11:06.425 --> 00:11:09.015
rights once the coup had been completed.

00:11:09.815 --> 00:11:12.465
Even just a tiny slice of

00:11:12.465 --> 00:11:14.115
Equatorial Guinea’s oil wealth

00:11:14.275 --> 00:11:15.795
would be worth billions.

00:11:16.815 --> 00:11:19.865
It was, in essence, a business deal

00:11:20.065 --> 00:11:22.455
disguised as a political revolution.

00:11:23.645 --> 00:11:26.415
Now, where does Mark Thatcher come in?

00:11:27.055 --> 00:11:30.135
Well, pulling off a military coup–paying

00:11:30.145 --> 00:11:31.815
the mercenaries, chartering the

00:11:31.815 --> 00:11:33.445
planes, getting the weapons and

00:11:33.465 --> 00:11:35.955
all of that–it was expensive stuff.

00:11:37.065 --> 00:11:38.435
Mann thought it would

00:11:38.435 --> 00:11:41.357
cost around $2.5 million.

00:11:41.935 --> 00:11:44.235
Small fry compared to the riches

00:11:44.255 --> 00:11:46.555
that awaited them, but someone

00:11:46.565 --> 00:11:48.075
needed to come up with the cash

00:11:48.285 --> 00:11:49.665
to get the operation moving.

00:11:50.565 --> 00:11:52.875
Calil, unfortunately, wasn’t

00:11:52.885 --> 00:11:54.375
in a position to do this.

00:11:54.895 --> 00:11:56.885
He might have had a Chelsea mansion

00:11:56.895 --> 00:12:00.155
and a reported 9-digit fortune, but

00:12:00.385 --> 00:12:02.155
the French authorities were in the

00:12:02.165 --> 00:12:03.965
middle of a criminal investigation

00:12:04.195 --> 00:12:05.805
into his business activities,

00:12:06.105 --> 00:12:08.245
and had frozen his bank accounts.

00:12:09.295 --> 00:12:12.505
Mann floated the idea to Mark Thatcher.

00:12:13.235 --> 00:12:15.655
He could invest in the project, and

00:12:16.065 --> 00:12:18.505
in return, he would have a stake in

00:12:18.505 --> 00:12:20.445
the future profits of the operation.

00:12:21.645 --> 00:12:23.255
Thatcher was in.

00:12:23.885 --> 00:12:25.845
He was in charge of sourcing a

00:12:25.845 --> 00:12:28.315
helicopter, which might seem like a

00:12:28.325 --> 00:12:31.165
strange task, but he was a trained

00:12:31.175 --> 00:12:34.205
helicopter pilot, so it did make sense.

00:12:35.455 --> 00:12:38.305
Mann got to work, recruiting South African

00:12:38.315 --> 00:12:40.975
mercenaries and planning the operation.

00:12:42.355 --> 00:12:44.155
He would even later claim that

00:12:44.165 --> 00:12:46.805
Margaret Thatcher herself–the former

00:12:46.805 --> 00:12:49.325
British Prime Minister–knew and

00:12:49.365 --> 00:12:51.565
approved of the plot, although this

00:12:51.565 --> 00:12:53.555
was vigorously denied by Thatcher.

00:12:54.916 --> 00:12:56.689
In any case, by early

00:12:56.689 --> 00:13:00.089
2004, the plan was settled.

00:13:01.239 --> 00:13:04.869
64 South African mercenaries would fly

00:13:05.029 --> 00:13:08.019
from South Africa to Harare, in Zimbabwe.

00:13:09.188 --> 00:13:11.639
There, they would pick up Mann and a

00:13:11.669 --> 00:13:15.059
bunch of weapons: guns, grenade launchers,

00:13:15.149 --> 00:13:18.119
explosives, and all of the sort of stuff

00:13:18.119 --> 00:13:20.289
that you need to launch a military coup.

00:13:21.389 --> 00:13:23.289
From there, the plane would

00:13:23.289 --> 00:13:25.479
continue to Equatorial Guinea.

00:13:26.259 --> 00:13:28.519
It would land, the men would jump out,

00:13:28.749 --> 00:13:31.449
take control of the airport, then, in

00:13:31.449 --> 00:13:33.429
conjunction with rebel troops who were

00:13:33.479 --> 00:13:35.629
there waiting for them, they would storm

00:13:35.629 --> 00:13:38.019
the presidential palace and arrest Obiang.

00:13:39.099 --> 00:13:40.589
Moto would arrive and

00:13:40.589 --> 00:13:42.019
declare himself president.

00:13:42.789 --> 00:13:44.269
The entire mission would

00:13:44.269 --> 00:13:45.419
last just a few hours.

00:13:45.749 --> 00:13:47.489
It would be quick, clean,

00:13:47.919 --> 00:13:49.319
and incredibly profitable.

00:13:50.669 --> 00:13:53.419
But the operation was sloppy.

00:13:54.069 --> 00:13:56.539
The mercenaries were too visible, the

00:13:56.539 --> 00:13:59.949
paperwork was too vague, and what’s more,

00:14:00.269 --> 00:14:02.409
the intelligence agencies were watching.

00:14:03.729 --> 00:14:05.119
Zimbabwean authorities

00:14:05.289 --> 00:14:06.789
had got wind of the plot.

00:14:07.361 --> 00:14:09.141
Before the plane even touched

00:14:09.141 --> 00:14:11.771
down at Harare airport, Mann

00:14:11.951 --> 00:14:13.801
was detained and arrested.

00:14:14.771 --> 00:14:17.211
He initially claimed that the weapons he

00:14:17.211 --> 00:14:20.321
was found with were to provide security at

00:14:20.321 --> 00:14:22.921
a diamond mine in the Democratic Republic

00:14:22.931 --> 00:14:26.171
of Congo, but nobody was buying this.

00:14:27.141 --> 00:14:29.891
What’s more, in Equatorial Guinea, the

00:14:29.901 --> 00:14:32.231
authorities arrested a group of South

00:14:32.231 --> 00:14:34.571
African and Angolan men who had been

00:14:34.571 --> 00:14:37.591
sent as a vanguard, an advance party.

00:14:38.631 --> 00:14:43.381
By March 9th, 2004, Mann and his

00:14:43.511 --> 00:14:45.411
“on the ground” mercenaries were

00:14:45.411 --> 00:14:48.161
behind bars, one batch in Zimbabwe

00:14:48.481 --> 00:14:50.621
and the other in Equatorial Guinea.

00:14:51.931 --> 00:14:54.771
President Obiang, you could say perfectly

00:14:54.771 --> 00:14:57.471
reasonably, was not best pleased to

00:14:57.471 --> 00:14:59.471
find out that there was this plot to

00:14:59.501 --> 00:15:02.381
overthrow him, seemingly with the tacit

00:15:02.411 --> 00:15:05.101
approval of various European governments.

00:15:06.211 --> 00:15:08.541
He publicly stated that he would bring

00:15:08.551 --> 00:15:10.801
Mann to Equatorial Guinea so that

00:15:10.801 --> 00:15:13.051
he could, and I’m quoting directly,

00:15:13.541 --> 00:15:15.761
“eat his testicles and then drag

00:15:15.761 --> 00:15:17.891
his naked body through the streets.”

00:15:19.301 --> 00:15:21.961
Now, whether that is a punishment Mann

00:15:21.961 --> 00:15:24.221
deserved is a question of opinion.

00:15:24.841 --> 00:15:26.231
Fortunately, it isn’t

00:15:26.231 --> 00:15:27.441
what actually happened.

00:15:28.301 --> 00:15:30.861
Mann was sentenced to prison, first

00:15:30.871 --> 00:15:33.571
in Zimbabwe, before then being handed

00:15:33.571 --> 00:15:36.121
over to Equatorial Guinea, where he was

00:15:36.121 --> 00:15:39.301
sentenced to 34 years in the country’s

00:15:39.341 --> 00:15:41.741
notorious “Black Beach Prison”.

00:15:43.071 --> 00:15:45.611
Fortunately, President Obiang seemed

00:15:45.731 --> 00:15:48.701
to have softened, and in 2009,

00:15:49.051 --> 00:15:51.321
after Mann agreed to identify his

00:15:51.321 --> 00:15:53.331
fellow conspirators, after serving

00:15:53.361 --> 00:15:55.071
only one and a half years of his

00:15:55.081 --> 00:15:57.626
34-year sentence, he was released.

00:15:58.846 --> 00:16:01.086
As for the other conspirators,

00:16:01.116 --> 00:16:03.246
nobody was particularly good

00:16:03.496 --> 00:16:04.926
at covering their tracks.

00:16:05.996 --> 00:16:08.086
In the immediate aftermath of this

00:16:08.256 --> 00:16:10.906
attempted coup, there were documents found

00:16:11.116 --> 00:16:14.066
that linked the operation to a network of

00:16:14.126 --> 00:16:16.526
offshore companies, shell corporations,

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:19.167
and bank accounts in places like the

00:16:19.177 --> 00:16:21.317
British Virgin Islands and Guernsey.

00:16:22.557 --> 00:16:25.387
One of these was a letter from Simon

00:16:25.387 --> 00:16:27.667
Mann to his wife, while he was still in

00:16:27.677 --> 00:16:30.189
jail in Zimbabwe, awaiting sentencing.

00:16:31.079 --> 00:16:34.729
This document named Ely Calil and Mark

00:16:34.769 --> 00:16:37.889
Thatcher, and contained the now infamous

00:16:37.909 --> 00:16:40.889
line “It may be that getting us out

00:16:41.109 --> 00:16:44.771
comes down to a large splodge of wonga”.

00:16:45.848 --> 00:16:47.808
Now, there’s some British slang

00:16:47.808 --> 00:16:49.588
in there, so let me explain it.

00:16:50.294 --> 00:16:52.888
Splodge means a large amount,

00:16:52.888 --> 00:16:54.868
but it’s normally something

00:16:54.878 --> 00:16:57.238
you’d use with something liquid

00:16:57.238 --> 00:17:00.218
or runny, like paint or jam.

00:17:01.246 --> 00:17:04.590
And “wonga” is slang for money.

00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:08.570
So, to translate that into more regular

00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:11.130
English, “it may be that to get us out of

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:13.580
jail, we need a large amount of money”.

00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:16.680
Bribes, payments made to persuade

00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:18.780
officials to look the other way or

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:21.240
make inconvenient problems, like

00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:22.600
being caught trying to launch a

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:24.870
military coup, simply disappear.

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:28.400
Now, there is no evidence that

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.550
this large amount of money ever was

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:33.060
handed over, but this phrase was

00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:35.570
pounced on by the British tabloids.

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:39.400
The coup became known by the press as the

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:43.220
Wonga coup, and, back home, Mark Thatcher

00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:45.535
had some tough questions to answer.

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:48.740
He was accused of financing the operation

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:51.970
and was later arrested in South Africa.

00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:55.480
He first claimed that he didn’t know

00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:57.340
that the helicopter would be used for

00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:59.950
a military coup, instead saying he

00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:02.250
thought it was a humanitarian airlift,

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:04.990
but later admitted that it “might

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:07.080
be used for mercenary activity”.

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:10.440
Fortunately for him, he escaped

00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:13.210
jail, but was given a large fine

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:15.690
and a four-year suspended sentence.

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:19.240
So what do we make of Simon

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:20.770
Mann and the Wonga Coup?

00:18:21.670 --> 00:18:24.040
On one level, it’s an improbable

00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:26.490
story of a failed mercenary adventure:

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:29.020
a group of former soldiers hoping

00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:31.240
to get rich through regime change.

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:34.530
But on another level, it’s about the

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:38.250
murky intersections of business, politics,

00:18:38.391 --> 00:18:40.291
and post-colonial power structures.

00:18:41.191 --> 00:18:43.281
Yes, Obiang might have been an

00:18:43.281 --> 00:18:45.996
egregiously corrupt dictator, but

00:18:46.191 --> 00:18:48.521
does that in any way justify a bunch

00:18:48.521 --> 00:18:50.051
of mercenaries overthrowing him?

00:18:51.301 --> 00:18:52.991
As of the time of recording this

00:18:53.011 --> 00:18:55.881
episode, Obiang is still in power,

00:18:56.321 --> 00:18:58.932
and will shortly be turning 83.

00:18:59.871 --> 00:19:02.561
His son, Teodorín, is still vice

00:19:02.561 --> 00:19:05.141
president and will almost certainly

00:19:05.161 --> 00:19:07.221
assume power when his father dies.

00:19:08.671 --> 00:19:11.471
And Equatorial Guinea continues to be

00:19:11.471 --> 00:19:13.691
one of the most unequal societies in the

00:19:13.691 --> 00:19:16.601
world, despite its vast natural wealth.

00:19:18.006 --> 00:19:20.696
As for Simon Mann, he died in May

00:19:20.706 --> 00:19:23.506
this year, his mercenary past–so

00:19:23.506 --> 00:19:25.446
he said–put well behind him.

00:19:26.772 --> 00:19:30.076
But the legacy of the Wonga Coup remains.

00:19:30.526 --> 00:19:32.496
It’s a cautionary tale about how

00:19:32.536 --> 00:19:34.266
easily ambition can turn into

00:19:34.306 --> 00:19:36.716
arrogance, and how the lines between

00:19:36.726 --> 00:19:39.716
business, war, and politics are often

00:19:39.726 --> 00:19:41.846
far blurrier than we like to think.

00:19:43.486 --> 00:19:45.366
OK then, that is it for today's

00:19:45.386 --> 00:19:47.686
episode on Simon Mann, Mark

00:19:47.736 --> 00:19:49.356
Thatcher and the Wonga coup.

00:19:49.742 --> 00:19:50.958
I hope it's been an interesting one,

00:19:51.198 --> 00:19:52.638
and that you've learnt something new.

00:19:53.158 --> 00:19:54.918
As a quick reminder, this was part

00:19:54.968 --> 00:19:57.368
two of this three-part mini-series.

00:19:57.668 --> 00:19:59.578
If you missed part one, that was on

00:19:59.578 --> 00:20:02.058
Mobutu Sese Soko, the charismatic

00:20:02.078 --> 00:20:03.928
and complicated leader of the

00:20:03.928 --> 00:20:05.668
Democratic Republic of Congo.

00:20:06.018 --> 00:20:09.068
And next up, in part three, we are going

00:20:09.068 --> 00:20:11.488
to talk about the Angolan Model, and

00:20:11.488 --> 00:20:13.798
how China’s interests in Africa compare

00:20:13.798 --> 00:20:16.468
to those of Africa’s former colonisers.

00:20:17.098 --> 00:20:19.248
You've been listening to English Learning

00:20:19.248 --> 00:20:21.858
for Curious Minds by Leonardo English.

00:20:22.288 --> 00:20:25.168
I'm Alastair Budge, you stay safe, and

00:20:25.168 --> 00:20:27.638
I'll catch you in the next episode.
