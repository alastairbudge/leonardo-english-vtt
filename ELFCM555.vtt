Hello, hello, hello, and welcome

00:00:07.989 --> 00:00:09.889
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:12.639
Minds, by Leonardo English, the show

00:00:12.649 --> 00:00:14.409
where you can listen to fascinating

00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:16.789
stories and learn weird and wonderful

00:00:16.799 --> 00:00:18.839
things about the world at the same

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:20.669
time as improving your English.

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:24.359
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is the start

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.529
of yet another three-part mini-series,

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:30.649
this time on the loose theme of “power

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:32.959
struggles in post-colonial Africa”.

00:00:33.659 --> 00:00:36.539
In part one, today’s episode, we are going

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:39.819
to learn about Mobutu Sese Seko, the man

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:42.079
who ruled the Democratic Republic of Congo

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:45.389
with an iron fist and a leopard-skin hat.

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:48.079
In part two, we are going to learn

00:00:48.279 --> 00:00:50.759
about the curious case of the man

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:53.389
who went to Eton, the most exclusive

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:55.549
private school in Britain, studying

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:58.199
alongside princes and plutocrats, but

00:00:58.389 --> 00:01:01.029
was arrested on the charge of attempting

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:03.989
a military coup in Equatorial Guinea.

00:01:04.529 --> 00:01:06.959
And in part three, we are going to zoom

00:01:06.959 --> 00:01:10.939
in on Angola to understand how Chinese

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.659
power and money have changed the rules

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:16.219
of the game in post-colonial Africa.

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:19.599
Ok then, let’s get right into it

00:01:19.839 --> 00:01:22.495
and talk about Mobutu Sese Seko.

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:27.379
There was a 1990 New York Times bestseller

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:30.469
called A Natural History of the Senses,

00:01:30.809 --> 00:01:33.579
where the author went into detail about

00:01:33.589 --> 00:01:37.019
the reasons that tastes change over time.

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:40.859
Why do children tend to dislike

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:42.679
certain flavours but start to

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:44.819
enjoy them as young adults?

00:01:45.129 --> 00:01:48.114
Why are our preferences at 45

00:01:48.388 --> 00:01:51.367
often different from those at 25?

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:55.209
In the case of today’s protagonist, at

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:58.539
the age of 25, his favourite drink–and

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:01.029
his only contribution to his wedding

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:03.709
banquet–was a single crate of beer,

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:08.389
but at 45, his tastes had evolved.

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:11.619
Any guest at one of his parties

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.919
would be greeted with a flute of

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:16.409
Pink Laurent Perrier champagne.

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:20.669
Now, this is probably not best explained

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:23.759
by any scientific theory, but rather

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:27.279
by the fact that at 25, he was a lowly

00:02:27.529 --> 00:02:31.069
army officer, and at 45, he was the

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:33.899
undisputed leader of sub-Saharan Africa’s

00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:37.339
largest country, and by some estimates,

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:40.419
one of the wealthiest men in the world.

00:02:41.499 --> 00:02:44.429
This is the story of Joseph-Désiré

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:47.369
Mobutu, or Mobutu Sese Seko,

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:49.009
as he would later be called.

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:54.979
He was born in 1930, in Lisala, a small

00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:57.859
town in what was then the Belgian Congo.

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:02.229
His mother was a hotel maid, and his

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:05.779
father a cook working for a Belgian judge.

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:09.299
His father died when he was only 8 years

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.689
old, and his uncle and grandfather stepped

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:15.676
up as sort of joint father figures.

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:18.639
It wasn’t a privileged upbringing by

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:21.659
any means, but the young boy was clever,

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:24.549
confident, and somewhat rebellious.

00:03:24.999 --> 00:03:26.759
He was known for all sorts of

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:29.169
pranks, tricks on his Catholic

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:32.269
school teachers, and with age, these

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:34.849
turned from classroom jokes into

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:37.509
more serious acts of disobedience.

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:40.769
He even ran away from school on a boat,

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.749
reportedly to go and meet a girl, and

00:03:43.899 --> 00:03:46.719
was found downriver several weeks later.

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.999
As a punishment for his misbehaviour, he

00:03:50.999 --> 00:03:53.939
was kicked out of school and forced to

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:57.139
join the Force Publique, the colonial army

00:03:57.279 --> 00:04:00.039
run by the Belgians, where he served for

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:02.489
a few years before becoming a journalist.

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:05.999
Now, before we move on, it’s worth

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:08.029
just reminding ourselves a little

00:04:08.029 --> 00:04:10.507
bit about the history of Congo at

00:04:10.547 --> 00:04:12.587
the time Mobutu was a young man.

00:04:13.687 --> 00:04:17.227
It was a Belgian colony, and of all

00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:19.437
the colonial regimes in Africa, it

00:04:19.437 --> 00:04:22.327
's hard to find one more extractive,

00:04:22.567 --> 00:04:24.997
oppressive and brutal than the

00:04:25.007 --> 00:04:27.667
Belgians’ colonisation of the Congo.

00:04:28.487 --> 00:04:30.577
You might know this already, perhaps

00:04:30.707 --> 00:04:32.547
you might remember some of this from

00:04:32.567 --> 00:04:36.572
Episode 289 on King Leopold II, but

00:04:36.973 --> 00:04:39.287
if you don’t, here’s a brief reminder.

00:04:40.107 --> 00:04:42.787
The country was treated as a vast

00:04:42.807 --> 00:04:46.007
resource mine—rubber, copper,

00:04:46.007 --> 00:04:49.257
uranium, diamonds—all extracted for

00:04:49.277 --> 00:04:51.717
Belgian profit, with practically zero

00:04:51.757 --> 00:04:54.467
consideration for the livelihood or

00:04:54.467 --> 00:04:56.937
well-being of any of the native people.

00:04:57.587 --> 00:04:59.167
The colonial administrators

00:04:59.317 --> 00:05:02.077
were fiendishly cruel, and the

00:05:02.077 --> 00:05:04.197
local population was kept in a

00:05:04.207 --> 00:05:06.527
state of dependency and fear.

00:05:06.947 --> 00:05:10.730
It was seriously grim, and an estimated

00:05:10.867 --> 00:05:13.747
10 million Congolese people were killed

00:05:13.767 --> 00:05:16.847
directly and indirectly in the first

00:05:16.847 --> 00:05:20.067
23 years of Belgian colonisation alone.

00:05:21.247 --> 00:05:23.597
And, as per most countries that

00:05:23.597 --> 00:05:26.407
were colonised, but even more so in

00:05:26.407 --> 00:05:28.227
the case of Congo, there had been

00:05:28.227 --> 00:05:30.807
practically no investment in local

00:05:30.837 --> 00:05:33.117
infrastructure, training of local people,

00:05:33.407 --> 00:05:36.647
or creation of laws or institutions.

00:05:37.877 --> 00:05:40.657
This meant that when independence came,

00:05:41.037 --> 00:05:45.287
as it inevitably did in 1960, Congo was

00:05:45.297 --> 00:05:48.307
desperately unprepared to govern itself.

00:05:48.887 --> 00:05:51.337
There was no political infrastructure,

00:05:51.457 --> 00:05:54.207
no experienced civil service, no

00:05:54.417 --> 00:05:57.437
established judiciary, and no military

00:05:57.437 --> 00:06:00.007
leadership beyond the Belgian officers

00:06:00.177 --> 00:06:01.697
who had run the Force Publique.

00:06:02.747 --> 00:06:05.657
Unlike British or French colonies,

00:06:05.807 --> 00:06:08.057
which had at least had some form

00:06:08.057 --> 00:06:10.317
of elite education system for local

00:06:10.317 --> 00:06:13.807
people, Belgium had deliberately avoided

00:06:14.087 --> 00:06:16.417
training a Congolese professional class.

00:06:17.667 --> 00:06:20.187
Indeed, at the time of independence

00:06:20.367 --> 00:06:24.917
in 1960, there were just 30 Congolese

00:06:24.937 --> 00:06:26.897
university graduates in the entire

00:06:26.947 --> 00:06:29.247
country, a country of around

00:06:29.257 --> 00:06:31.700
15 million people at the time.

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:34.689
So, back to Mobutu.

00:06:35.571 --> 00:06:37.930
At the time of Congolese independence,

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.060
he had been working as a journalist for

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.520
a few years, and had become friendly

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:45.099
with a man named Patrice Lumumba.

00:06:46.022 --> 00:06:49.010
Lumumba was a fiery orator and

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:51.380
committed nationalist who won the

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:53.650
country’s first democratic election.

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:57.399
As his secretary, he chose Mobutu.

00:06:58.168 --> 00:07:00.675
But if you are thinking of “secretary”

00:07:00.925 --> 00:07:04.045
as an administrative helper who brought

00:07:04.115 --> 00:07:06.375
coffee and tea, and greeted guests

00:07:06.405 --> 00:07:08.995
at the reception, no, Mobutu was a

00:07:08.995 --> 00:07:10.985
very different kind of secretary.

00:07:11.685 --> 00:07:14.345
He was charismatic, spoke several

00:07:14.345 --> 00:07:17.145
languages, fiercely intelligent, and

00:07:17.385 --> 00:07:19.735
was effectively Lumumba’s trusted

00:07:19.745 --> 00:07:21.845
right hand man and confidant.

00:07:22.725 --> 00:07:25.345
Or as one US ambassador’s private

00:07:25.345 --> 00:07:28.425
notes put it, “this was an extremely

00:07:28.425 --> 00:07:31.085
intelligent man, very young, perhaps

00:07:31.235 --> 00:07:34.865
immature, but a man with great potential”.

00:07:36.355 --> 00:07:38.975
Lumumba had clearly seen this potential,

00:07:38.975 --> 00:07:42.453
too, and promoted Mobutu to colonel and

00:07:42.453 --> 00:07:44.723
soon after, Chief of Staff of the national

00:07:44.723 --> 00:07:48.013
army - a meteoric rise that gave him

00:07:48.043 --> 00:07:50.393
enormous influence over the country’s

00:07:50.463 --> 00:07:52.623
only cohesive institution at the time.

00:07:53.713 --> 00:07:55.557
But for Lumumba it

00:07:55.557 --> 00:07:57.467
would backfire terribly.

00:07:58.717 --> 00:08:00.647
Shortly after the declaration of

00:08:00.647 --> 00:08:04.377
independence, on the 30th of June 1960,

00:08:04.687 --> 00:08:07.577
the country had fallen into disarray.

00:08:08.477 --> 00:08:10.677
Lumumba was technically the

00:08:10.677 --> 00:08:13.367
Prime Minister, but his hold on

00:08:13.367 --> 00:08:15.747
the country was shaky at best.

00:08:16.507 --> 00:08:18.857
Force Publique soldiers mutinied,

00:08:19.247 --> 00:08:21.107
and when it looked like the United

00:08:21.107 --> 00:08:23.237
Nations peacekeepers sent in to help

00:08:23.427 --> 00:08:25.097
wouldn’t be able to contain them,

00:08:25.367 --> 00:08:28.157
the Prime Minister, Lumumba, turned

00:08:28.337 --> 00:08:30.837
to the Soviet Union for assistance.

00:08:31.617 --> 00:08:33.517
The Soviets sent technical

00:08:33.517 --> 00:08:36.157
advisors and support, which helped

00:08:36.207 --> 00:08:38.977
quell the unrest, but created

00:08:39.137 --> 00:08:41.477
an altogether different problem.

00:08:42.657 --> 00:08:46.377
This was 1960, the peak of the Cold

00:08:46.377 --> 00:08:49.177
War, and the United States got very

00:08:49.177 --> 00:08:51.927
nervous at the idea of Soviet influence

00:08:52.107 --> 00:08:53.927
in the newly independent Congo.

00:08:55.307 --> 00:08:57.907
With the backing of Belgian and, most

00:08:57.907 --> 00:09:00.717
likely, also U.S. intelligence, Mobutu

00:09:00.717 --> 00:09:04.117
orchestrated a coup-like intervention

00:09:04.337 --> 00:09:06.687
that removed Lumumba from power.

00:09:07.377 --> 00:09:10.127
Lumumba fled, was arrested by troops

00:09:10.317 --> 00:09:13.542
loyal to Mobutu, but instead of being

00:09:13.792 --> 00:09:17.082
tried or protected, he was flown to

00:09:17.082 --> 00:09:19.482
a breakaway province hostile to his

00:09:19.482 --> 00:09:22.492
leadership and handed over to his enemies.

00:09:23.622 --> 00:09:25.642
There, the country’s first

00:09:25.652 --> 00:09:27.782
democratically elected leader was

00:09:27.812 --> 00:09:30.282
brutally tortured and executed,

00:09:30.552 --> 00:09:32.722
with Belgian officers watching on.

00:09:33.502 --> 00:09:35.812
His death shocked the world and

00:09:35.982 --> 00:09:38.592
remains one of the darkest stains on

00:09:38.612 --> 00:09:40.512
Congo’s post-independence history.

00:09:41.392 --> 00:09:44.142
Now, importantly, this first

00:09:44.362 --> 00:09:46.152
“coup”, as it's been called,

00:09:46.342 --> 00:09:48.332
was relatively bloodless.

00:09:48.782 --> 00:09:50.922
It wasn’t good news if you were Patrice

00:09:50.952 --> 00:09:54.022
Lumumba, but it seemed like Mobutu

00:09:54.022 --> 00:09:56.732
was a loyal army officer who only

00:09:56.732 --> 00:09:59.022
had the best in mind for his country.

00:10:00.332 --> 00:10:02.772
He claimed it was a “neutralisation”

00:10:02.782 --> 00:10:05.102
of all political figures, Lumumba

00:10:05.102 --> 00:10:08.322
included, and declared that Congo

00:10:08.482 --> 00:10:10.633
would be governed by technocrats

00:10:10.752 --> 00:10:12.352
for the following six months.

00:10:13.952 --> 00:10:16.382
What actually happened, though, was

00:10:16.392 --> 00:10:19.722
less a smooth technocratic transition

00:10:20.087 --> 00:10:22.645
and more a chaotic power vacuum.

00:10:23.555 --> 00:10:26.065
The so-called “neutral government” that

00:10:26.065 --> 00:10:29.095
Mobutu installed quickly lost legitimacy.

00:10:29.705 --> 00:10:32.155
Regional leaders and army officers

00:10:32.355 --> 00:10:33.995
began acting independently.

00:10:34.425 --> 00:10:36.925
The country effectively fractured.

00:10:37.275 --> 00:10:39.775
In the mineral-rich south, backed

00:10:39.795 --> 00:10:42.315
by Belgian mining interests, one

00:10:42.315 --> 00:10:44.444
province declared independence.

00:10:44.874 --> 00:10:47.294
In the east, another city became a

00:10:47.304 --> 00:10:49.714
stronghold for Lumumba’s supporters.

00:10:50.054 --> 00:10:51.934
There were foreign troops from the

00:10:51.934 --> 00:10:54.424
United Nations, Belgian commandos,

00:10:54.554 --> 00:10:57.314
and even Cuban advisors in the mix.

00:10:57.854 --> 00:11:00.644
The entire country was being pulled apart

00:11:00.864 --> 00:11:04.404
by competing forces, and Mobutu, far

00:11:04.404 --> 00:11:07.474
from being a neutral arbiter, was quietly

00:11:07.704 --> 00:11:10.104
consolidating power in the background.

00:11:11.352 --> 00:11:13.792
Over the next few years, he positioned

00:11:13.792 --> 00:11:16.272
himself as the one figure who

00:11:16.272 --> 00:11:17.972
could hold the country together.

00:11:19.292 --> 00:11:22.822
And to a population exhausted by years

00:11:22.832 --> 00:11:25.722
of instability and civil war, the idea

00:11:25.722 --> 00:11:28.122
of a strongman didn’t sound so bad.

00:11:29.162 --> 00:11:32.472
So, in 1965, at the age of

00:11:32.472 --> 00:11:36.042
35, Mobutu saw his chance.

00:11:37.302 --> 00:11:39.672
He used a request from the President

00:11:39.712 --> 00:11:42.622
to “temporarily restore order” as a

00:11:42.632 --> 00:11:45.252
springboard to launch a military coup.

00:11:45.902 --> 00:11:47.702
He seized control of the country,

00:11:48.082 --> 00:11:51.002
and in a landmark speech, declared

00:11:51.152 --> 00:11:53.662
that Congo had been so damaged by

00:11:53.662 --> 00:11:55.742
politicians and bad actors in the

00:11:55.752 --> 00:11:58.152
five years since independence that

00:11:58.342 --> 00:12:00.802
it would take at least another five

00:12:00.802 --> 00:12:03.352
years to get things back on track.

00:12:04.399 --> 00:12:07.402
So he dissolved parliament, banned all

00:12:07.402 --> 00:12:10.202
political parties, and declared that

00:12:10.202 --> 00:12:12.362
for the next five years, there would

00:12:12.362 --> 00:12:15.872
only be one voice in the Congo: his.

00:12:17.152 --> 00:12:21.812
This was 1965, and for the next 32

00:12:21.822 --> 00:12:23.902
years, he would rule the country

00:12:24.182 --> 00:12:25.772
through a mixture of carrot,

00:12:26.062 --> 00:12:28.642
stick, and cult of personality.

00:12:29.832 --> 00:12:32.222
And so began the process of

00:12:32.242 --> 00:12:34.672
rebranding not just Mobutu the

00:12:34.682 --> 00:12:37.572
man, but the nation itself.

00:12:38.732 --> 00:12:41.762
In 1971, he renamed the country

00:12:42.072 --> 00:12:44.882
Zaire, saying the name “Congo”

00:12:45.032 --> 00:12:46.952
was a relic of colonialism.

00:12:48.202 --> 00:12:51.402
He also renamed himself, dropping

00:12:51.692 --> 00:12:54.302
“Joseph-Désiré” and adopting a far

00:12:54.302 --> 00:12:58.501
more theatrical title: Mobutu Sese Seko

00:12:58.714 --> 00:13:02.942
Kuku Ngbendu wa Za Banga, which roughly

00:13:02.952 --> 00:13:05.952
translates as “the all-powerful warrior

00:13:06.292 --> 00:13:08.292
who, because of his endurance and

00:13:08.292 --> 00:13:11.162
inflexible will to win, goes from conquest

00:13:11.172 --> 00:13:13.942
to conquest, leaving fire in his wake.”

00:13:15.312 --> 00:13:15.992
Quite something.

00:13:17.212 --> 00:13:18.932
And he didn’t stop there.

00:13:19.412 --> 00:13:23.322
Streets, cities, rivers, and even clothing

00:13:23.492 --> 00:13:26.412
were swept up in this new cultural vision.

00:13:26.982 --> 00:13:28.322
Western names were

00:13:28.332 --> 00:13:30.056
replaced with African ones.

00:13:30.452 --> 00:13:32.752
Suits and ties were banned from

00:13:32.762 --> 00:13:34.762
government offices and replaced

00:13:34.812 --> 00:13:37.602
with a collarless shirt known as the

00:13:37.662 --> 00:13:40.522
“abacost”, which is short for à bas

00:13:40.522 --> 00:13:43.172
le costume, or “down with the suit”.

00:13:43.932 --> 00:13:46.272
Foreign music was pushed aside

00:13:46.512 --> 00:13:48.492
in favour of homegrown styles.

00:13:48.834 --> 00:13:51.060
The whole campaign was called the

00:13:51.316 --> 00:13:53.430
Authenticité movement, meaning

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:55.490
“authenticity” in English.

00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:59.150
Now, this movement was initially

00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:00.840
very popular in the Congo,

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:03.000
or Zaire as it was then.

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:05.220
And it was also praised by

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:06.560
some foreign commentators.

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:09.720
After all, Mobutu was pushing for

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:12.430
a kind of cultural decolonisation,

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:15.630
encouraging pride in African identity

00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:18.236
after decades of European rule.

00:14:19.475 --> 00:14:22.190
But others were more sceptical.

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:24.350
They said it was less about

00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:26.430
pride and more about power.

00:14:27.567 --> 00:14:30.610
Authenticité didn’t just strip the country

00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:33.100
of European names; it gave Mobutu the

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:36.280
excuse to eliminate anyone who wasn’t

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:39.780
“authentically Zairian,” or who disagreed

00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:41.680
with his vision of what that meant.

00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:45.510
He was now not just the president,

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:47.580
but something closer to a monarch.

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:50.260
He installed giant portraits

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.220
of himself in public squares.

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:54.870
His face appeared on banknotes,

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:56.750
stamps, and schoolbooks.

00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:59.790
He referred to himself as “the father

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:02.170
of the nation,” “the guide,” and “the

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:05.200
messiah.” At official events, his

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:07.660
name would often be introduced with a

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:10.550
list of over a dozen honorific titles.

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:13.870
And of course, there was

00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:15.380
the leopard-skin hat.

00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:17.570
Always present, always

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:18.970
perfectly positioned.

00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:21.110
It became a symbol of his rule;

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:24.000
part theatre, part menace.

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:28.080
Alongside it came his carved ebony

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:31.040
walking stick, his dark glasses, and

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:33.680
his meticulously tailored abacost.

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:37.110
This was a man who took image

00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:39.960
seriously, a man who understood

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:42.150
the power of performance.

00:15:43.385 --> 00:15:46.010
But behind the smiling portraits

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:48.410
and grandiose titles was a

00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:50.440
deeply repressive regime.

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:53.590
Dissidents were routinely tortured

00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:56.130
or disappeared, opposition parties

00:15:56.130 --> 00:15:58.410
were outlawed, and intelligence

00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:00.510
agencies kept the population

00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:02.330
under constant surveillance.

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:04.450
Public executions were

00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:06.180
staged to send a message.

00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:09.160
Mobutu’s grip on power wasn’t just

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:12.360
psychological; it was brutally enforced.

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:16.220
And during all of this, the country

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:18.590
was in a serious state of decay.

00:16:19.156 --> 00:16:21.190
Mobutu ruled through a complex

00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:23.610
web of patronage, of dispersing

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:25.870
power, favours and money to

00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:27.630
his family, friends and allies.

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:31.094
If you were loyal, you were rewarded.

00:16:31.814 --> 00:16:33.354
If you weren’t, you were either

00:16:33.404 --> 00:16:36.174
exiled, imprisoned, or worse.

00:16:37.134 --> 00:16:39.484
Corruption wasn’t just tolerated,

00:16:39.704 --> 00:16:41.764
it was built into the system.

00:16:43.104 --> 00:16:46.104
In one speech, he said, “If you want

00:16:46.114 --> 00:16:48.824
to steal, steal a little in a nice way.

00:16:49.284 --> 00:16:51.814
Only if you steal so much as to become

00:16:51.814 --> 00:16:53.854
rich overnight, you will be caught.”

00:16:55.154 --> 00:16:56.924
Perhaps he should have clarified

00:16:57.124 --> 00:16:58.894
that there was one man for whom

00:16:58.924 --> 00:17:01.494
this rule didn’t apply: him.

00:17:02.824 --> 00:17:05.874
Estimates vary, but Mobutu is believed

00:17:05.904 --> 00:17:08.734
to have embezzled somewhere between $4

00:17:08.814 --> 00:17:12.144
and $15 billion during his time in power.

00:17:13.304 --> 00:17:16.744
Indeed, in 1970, he is estimated

00:17:16.924 --> 00:17:19.584
to have stolen 60% of the

00:17:19.584 --> 00:17:21.764
entire country’s annual budget.

00:17:23.192 --> 00:17:26.102
And this wasn’t all stashed away in

00:17:26.102 --> 00:17:28.252
Swiss bank accounts; there were lavish

00:17:28.252 --> 00:17:30.792
displays of wealth and opulence.

00:17:31.242 --> 00:17:34.402
He built a huge palace in his ancestral

00:17:34.412 --> 00:17:36.852
home in northern Congo, which was

00:17:36.852 --> 00:17:39.002
dubbed “The Versailles of the Jungle”.

00:17:39.512 --> 00:17:41.422
He had more homes in France,

00:17:41.652 --> 00:17:42.922
Portugal, and Switzerland.

00:17:43.302 --> 00:17:45.272
He travelled with a refrigerated

00:17:45.272 --> 00:17:47.292
case of pink champagne, and

00:17:47.502 --> 00:17:49.582
there are reports of suits being

00:17:49.582 --> 00:17:51.962
sent to Paris for dry cleaning.

00:17:52.942 --> 00:17:55.422
In the 1980s, he even reportedly

00:17:55.422 --> 00:17:57.782
had a Concorde jet pick him up

00:17:58.002 --> 00:17:59.732
for shopping trips in Europe.

00:18:00.822 --> 00:18:03.642
Meanwhile, back in Zaire, as it was

00:18:03.642 --> 00:18:06.712
then, schools crumbled, hospitals

00:18:06.772 --> 00:18:09.342
lacked medicine, teachers and civil

00:18:09.342 --> 00:18:12.072
servants often went unpaid for months.

00:18:12.812 --> 00:18:14.812
The economy became increasingly

00:18:14.812 --> 00:18:17.532
dependent on foreign aid and loans.

00:18:18.542 --> 00:18:20.312
And when there was a crash in

00:18:20.312 --> 00:18:22.222
the price of copper, which was

00:18:22.222 --> 00:18:24.392
one of Zaire’s main exports, the

00:18:24.412 --> 00:18:26.742
country literally ran out of money.

00:18:27.351 --> 00:18:29.942
Inflation soared, debt piled

00:18:29.942 --> 00:18:32.732
up, and the state became little

00:18:32.732 --> 00:18:34.462
more than an empty shell.

00:18:35.542 --> 00:18:38.062
Yet, Mobutu remained in power.

00:18:38.972 --> 00:18:40.562
Partly because he was a

00:18:40.572 --> 00:18:42.472
master manipulator, but

00:18:42.472 --> 00:18:44.672
also because of geopolitics.

00:18:45.432 --> 00:18:48.032
Throughout the Cold War, the West had seen

00:18:48.032 --> 00:18:51.232
him as a reliable anti-communist ally.

00:18:52.142 --> 00:18:55.402
He hosted CIA operations, supported

00:18:55.412 --> 00:18:58.682
US-backed rebels in Angola, and regularly

00:18:58.702 --> 00:19:01.362
reminded Washington that if they didn’t

00:19:01.382 --> 00:19:04.322
support him, the Soviets might take over.

00:19:05.842 --> 00:19:08.492
The irony, of course, was that Mobutu

00:19:08.952 --> 00:19:12.002
wasn’t exactly consistent in his ideology.

00:19:12.702 --> 00:19:15.422
He had been outspoken in his admiration

00:19:15.602 --> 00:19:18.492
for Mao Zedong, and had flirted with

00:19:18.492 --> 00:19:20.552
ideas from the Chinese Revolution.

00:19:21.462 --> 00:19:23.622
He condemned European decadence

00:19:23.992 --> 00:19:26.322
all while sipping French champagne

00:19:26.322 --> 00:19:28.282
and collecting fine European art.

00:19:29.162 --> 00:19:31.372
He presented himself as the symbol

00:19:31.372 --> 00:19:33.832
of African pride, while secretly

00:19:33.832 --> 00:19:36.262
collaborating with Belgian intelligence

00:19:36.422 --> 00:19:38.312
to remove Lumumba, one of the

00:19:38.312 --> 00:19:40.722
continent’s great anti-colonial leaders.

00:19:41.702 --> 00:19:43.992
It was hard to see what he

00:19:43.992 --> 00:19:45.712
stood for, apart from his

00:19:45.712 --> 00:19:47.522
personal enrichment, that was.

00:19:48.952 --> 00:19:51.592
And by the early 1990s,

00:19:51.892 --> 00:19:53.792
things were falling apart.

00:19:55.082 --> 00:19:57.792
The Cold War was over, and as there was

00:19:57.802 --> 00:19:59.992
no threat of the Soviet Union trying

00:19:59.992 --> 00:20:02.152
to push communist ideology in Africa,

00:20:02.522 --> 00:20:04.749
the West no longer needed Mobutu.

00:20:05.412 --> 00:20:06.912
The Aid dried up.

00:20:07.382 --> 00:20:09.682
Western diplomats, who had once been

00:20:09.682 --> 00:20:12.212
his staunch allies, now publicly

00:20:12.212 --> 00:20:14.132
called for democratic reform.

00:20:15.332 --> 00:20:17.172
And inside the country,

00:20:17.732 --> 00:20:18.782
people were fed up.

00:20:19.292 --> 00:20:22.012
Civil servants hadn’t been paid in months.

00:20:22.262 --> 00:20:24.582
University students were protesting.

00:20:24.812 --> 00:20:26.902
The army was unpaid and

00:20:26.922 --> 00:20:28.579
increasingly mutinous.

00:20:29.032 --> 00:20:30.752
Strikes, demonstrations,

00:20:30.782 --> 00:20:32.432
and riots became common.

00:20:33.052 --> 00:20:35.972
The myth of Mobutu’s invincibility

00:20:36.322 --> 00:20:38.432
began to crumble, and with it,

00:20:38.692 --> 00:20:40.582
the carefully constructed image

00:20:40.822 --> 00:20:42.652
of the “father of the nation.”

00:20:43.232 --> 00:20:44.612
Pro-democracy movements

00:20:44.772 --> 00:20:46.252
were sweeping the continent.

00:20:46.662 --> 00:20:49.042
Mobutu, who was now ageing and

00:20:49.152 --> 00:20:51.632
increasingly unwell, was forced

00:20:51.742 --> 00:20:53.302
to start promising reforms.

00:20:54.342 --> 00:20:57.312
He said there would be free elections.

00:20:57.602 --> 00:20:59.302
But they never came.

00:21:00.762 --> 00:21:03.262
In 1996, a rebellion sprung

00:21:03.262 --> 00:21:04.552
up across the country.

00:21:05.042 --> 00:21:06.902
Their armies swept through

00:21:06.992 --> 00:21:08.942
eastern Zaire with lightning

00:21:08.942 --> 00:21:11.062
speed, facing little resistance.

00:21:11.856 --> 00:21:13.212
Mobutu’s once-feared

00:21:13.212 --> 00:21:14.992
army barely fought back.

00:21:15.692 --> 00:21:17.942
Many soldiers simply deserted,

00:21:18.152 --> 00:21:19.942
while others joined the rebellion.

00:21:20.912 --> 00:21:23.992
In a matter of months, the rebels had

00:21:24.002 --> 00:21:26.182
captured vast swathes of the country.

00:21:27.012 --> 00:21:29.845
Their leader, a man named Laurent-Désiré

00:21:29.845 --> 00:21:33.052
Kabila, promised an end to dictatorship,

00:21:33.562 --> 00:21:36.702
and as his forces advanced westward,

00:21:37.082 --> 00:21:39.992
city after city fell without a fight.

00:21:41.042 --> 00:21:43.322
Mobutu’s control evaporated

00:21:43.642 --> 00:21:45.069
almost overnight.

00:21:46.242 --> 00:21:47.292
So, he fled.

00:21:48.092 --> 00:21:50.032
First to his palace in the north

00:21:50.032 --> 00:21:51.862
of the country, the so-called

00:21:51.862 --> 00:21:53.082
Versailles of the Jungle.

00:21:53.622 --> 00:21:56.472
But even there, he was not safe.

00:21:57.042 --> 00:21:58.652
He attempted to negotiate a peace

00:21:58.652 --> 00:22:01.122
deal, but no one was interested.

00:22:01.552 --> 00:22:03.222
The world had moved on.

00:22:04.452 --> 00:22:06.832
What’s more, he was a very sick man,

00:22:07.192 --> 00:22:09.672
and had been battling prostate cancer.

00:22:10.602 --> 00:22:13.072
He tried to negotiate with France for

00:22:13.082 --> 00:22:16.112
medical treatment, but they refused.

00:22:16.552 --> 00:22:18.272
No one wanted to be seen

00:22:18.312 --> 00:22:19.872
propping him up anymore.

00:22:21.082 --> 00:22:23.622
He boarded a plane and flew to Togo,

00:22:23.922 --> 00:22:26.562
then to Morocco, where he had property.

00:22:27.682 --> 00:22:30.562
He arrived in Rabat as a disgraced

00:22:30.592 --> 00:22:33.372
former leader, his entourage vastly

00:22:33.372 --> 00:22:36.702
reduced, his fortune frozen or looted.

00:22:37.982 --> 00:22:39.982
He died just a few months later,

00:22:40.292 --> 00:22:43.742
in September 1997, aged 66.

00:22:44.572 --> 00:22:46.812
There was no state funeral,

00:22:46.862 --> 00:22:48.422
no national mourning.

00:22:48.922 --> 00:22:51.562
Just a quiet death in a foreign

00:22:51.562 --> 00:22:53.982
land, a dramatic fall for a

00:22:53.982 --> 00:22:56.142
man who had once styled himself

00:22:56.292 --> 00:22:58.242
as the embodiment of a nation.

00:22:59.442 --> 00:23:01.872
And yet, his legacy lives on.

00:23:02.752 --> 00:23:05.817
Not in statues or street names–most of

00:23:05.817 --> 00:23:08.817
those were removed a long time ago–but in

00:23:08.817 --> 00:23:11.157
the structure of the state he left behind.

00:23:11.877 --> 00:23:13.937
A system of patronage, of

00:23:14.117 --> 00:23:16.137
centralised power, of wealth

00:23:16.357 --> 00:23:18.617
concentrated in the hands of a few.

00:23:19.817 --> 00:23:22.177
The Democratic Republic of Congo is one

00:23:22.207 --> 00:23:24.217
of the wealthiest countries in the world

00:23:24.487 --> 00:23:26.887
in terms of its natural resources, with

00:23:27.117 --> 00:23:30.417
huge deposits of copper, cobalt, gold,

00:23:30.597 --> 00:23:32.917
diamonds, and other precious metals.

00:23:33.417 --> 00:23:35.137
It has a population of more

00:23:35.137 --> 00:23:37.967
than 100 million people, yet

00:23:38.207 --> 00:23:40.987
75% of them live in poverty.

00:23:42.307 --> 00:23:44.987
In 1960, when Mobutu first took

00:23:44.987 --> 00:23:46.647
power, it was one of the most

00:23:46.647 --> 00:23:48.547
industrialised countries in Africa,

00:23:48.917 --> 00:23:50.847
second only to South Africa.

00:23:51.917 --> 00:23:53.927
It is now one of the poorest.

00:23:54.927 --> 00:23:56.917
Clearly, there are many more reasons

00:23:56.917 --> 00:23:59.147
for this than Mobutu Sese Seko.

00:23:59.777 --> 00:24:01.137
He was a man of his time.

00:24:01.497 --> 00:24:04.057
A product of colonialism, Cold War

00:24:04.057 --> 00:24:06.147
politics, and personal ambition.

00:24:07.167 --> 00:24:10.547
But his story is also a warning, of

00:24:10.547 --> 00:24:12.857
what happens when power is unchecked,

00:24:13.187 --> 00:24:16.007
when image replaces substance, and

00:24:16.197 --> 00:24:18.547
when a country is ruled not for its

00:24:18.557 --> 00:24:20.867
people, but for the enrichment of

00:24:20.867 --> 00:24:23.587
a single man in a leopard-skin hat.

00:24:25.225 --> 00:24:28.047
OK then, that is it for today's episode

00:24:28.257 --> 00:24:30.887
on Mobutu Sese Seko, or to give him his

00:24:30.887 --> 00:24:33.507
full title, “the all-powerful warrior who,

00:24:33.507 --> 00:24:35.187
because of his endurance and inflexible

00:24:35.187 --> 00:24:37.147
will to win, goes from conquest to

00:24:37.157 --> 00:24:39.327
conquest, leaving fire in his wake.”

00:24:40.117 --> 00:24:42.387
As a quick reminder, this is part

00:24:42.387 --> 00:24:44.547
one of a three-part mini-series

00:24:44.577 --> 00:24:46.567
on the loose theme of power

00:24:46.567 --> 00:24:48.667
struggles in post-colonial Africa.

00:24:49.117 --> 00:24:51.327
Next up, in part two, will be an

00:24:51.337 --> 00:24:54.886
episode on Simon Mann, the ex-Etonian

00:24:54.886 --> 00:24:56.887
who tried to hatch a plot to

00:24:56.897 --> 00:24:59.297
launch a coup in Equatorial Guinea.

00:24:59.617 --> 00:25:01.367
And in part three, we will be

00:25:01.367 --> 00:25:03.297
talking about the Angolan Model,

00:25:03.677 --> 00:25:05.977
and the new economic model China

00:25:05.977 --> 00:25:07.707
is pioneering on the continent.

00:25:08.377 --> 00:25:10.227
You've been listening to English Learning

00:25:10.227 --> 00:25:12.977
for Curious Minds by Leonardo English.

00:25:13.437 --> 00:25:16.117
I'm Alastair Budge, you stay safe, and

00:25:16.117 --> 00:25:18.437
I'll catch you in the next episode.
