Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:16.260
English, the show where you can listen to fascinating stories and learn weird

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:20.889
and wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.250
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is a slightly different type of episode, a more personal one.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:33.040
Last year, on March 5th, to be precise, I released an episode about Sweden.

00:00:33.679 --> 00:00:38.460
I had never been there before, I had no links to Sweden or Swedish heritage,

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.320
but just hours before the episode was released, I had packed up all of my

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.330
worldly belongings and moved to Sweden with my wife and our two young kids.

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:54.360
So, this episode is going to be a slightly more personal one than usual, where

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:00.044
I’ll share my experience, 1 year on, of living in Sweden, the good AND the bad,

00:01:00.312 --> 00:01:06.058
and give my perspective on what life in this Scandinavian country is really like.

00:01:06.808 --> 00:01:09.218
OK then, let’s get started, shall we?

00:01:11.008 --> 00:01:15.618
If you use the social network and news-sharing platform Reddit,

00:01:16.028 --> 00:01:19.961
you’ll know that it is based on the idea of “subreddits”.

00:01:20.536 --> 00:01:26.968
A subreddit is essentially a forum based on a particular interest or topic.

00:01:27.568 --> 00:01:33.548
There are large subreddits, people talking about global politics or Apple products.

00:01:33.962 --> 00:01:38.425
And there are very small, incredibly niche subreddits.

00:01:38.703 --> 00:01:42.737
A subreddit dedicated to posting pictures of rare lobsters.

00:01:43.037 --> 00:01:47.517
One dedicated to people sharing pictures of unusual pillows.

00:01:48.497 --> 00:01:51.560
There is also one called TillSverige.

00:01:51.917 --> 00:01:56.567
It means “to Sweden” in Swedish, and it is all based

00:01:56.567 --> 00:02:00.707
on sharing information for foreigners moving to Sweden.

00:02:01.837 --> 00:02:07.557
It might sound niche, but it is pretty active, with its 55,000

00:02:07.557 --> 00:02:12.637
members putting it in the top 3% of all communities on Reddit.

00:02:13.577 --> 00:02:17.897
There is a lot of useful information there, if you are someone who happens to

00:02:17.897 --> 00:02:23.297
be moving to Sweden, that is, but there is also a certain repetitiveness to it.

00:02:24.097 --> 00:02:29.497
Every few days, there is the same post from someone, more often than not an American,

00:02:29.977 --> 00:02:36.297
who is disillusioned with the situation in their country and has decided that Sweden

00:02:36.327 --> 00:02:41.597
is heaven on earth, and they are willing to do anything in order to move here.

00:02:42.254 --> 00:02:50.234
Free healthcare, unionised jobs, paid sick leave, years of maternity leave, you name it, this person

00:02:50.404 --> 00:02:56.714
has decided that Sweden is where they want to be, their only question is, how can they get there?

00:02:57.674 --> 00:03:02.664
To which, the moderators and members of the subreddit politely inform them that,

00:03:02.994 --> 00:03:08.904
while Sweden may have or be some of those things, it is not a complete utopia.

00:03:09.834 --> 00:03:15.984
I am not a moderator of the TillSverige subreddit, nor am I an expert on all things

00:03:15.984 --> 00:03:23.074
Sweden, but over the next 20 minutes or so, I will share my perspective, one year in, on

00:03:23.104 --> 00:03:28.814
Sweden, what life is like as someone new to the country, and what I think you can learn

00:03:28.824 --> 00:03:34.485
about Sweden the country from some of the ways in which Swedish society is structured.

00:03:35.605 --> 00:03:40.498
The first question to address, I guess, is, why am I in Sweden?

00:03:41.041 --> 00:03:43.011
The answer is actually quite simple.

00:03:43.411 --> 00:03:49.404
My wife is a university lecturer, and she was offered a job at the University of Gothenburg.

00:03:50.101 --> 00:03:54.911
Gothenburg, as you may know, is a city on the west coast of Sweden.

00:03:55.561 --> 00:04:00.201
It’s the second largest city in Sweden, after Stockholm, the capital, and

00:04:00.451 --> 00:04:06.171
it’s about halfway between Oslo to the north and Copenhagen to the south.

00:04:06.971 --> 00:04:12.141
Neither my wife nor I had ever been to Gothenburg before she applied for the position,

00:04:12.571 --> 00:04:18.561
and in fact, she only spent 36 hours in the city, for her interview, before accepting it.

00:04:19.341 --> 00:04:26.161
So, 12 months ago, we moved here knowing almost nothing about the city, and our knowledge of

00:04:26.161 --> 00:04:32.371
Sweden was limited to reading books, watching documentaries, and speaking with Swedish friends.

00:04:33.091 --> 00:04:39.681
Strangely enough, where we lived before–Malta–has a lot of Swedish people, who are typically

00:04:39.681 --> 00:04:44.991
there to work in the online gambling sector, so we did have friends who were able to

00:04:45.011 --> 00:04:50.711
tell us a little bit about life in Sweden and give us some pointers before we arrived.

00:04:51.507 --> 00:04:56.428
Anyway, other than the little we had been told or had read about, we knew

00:04:56.818 --> 00:05:01.388
almost nothing about Sweden and knew nobody in the city we were moving to.

00:05:02.468 --> 00:05:06.938
Now, the first category of things I want to talk about today is

00:05:06.948 --> 00:05:11.778
something that anyone moving to a new country is faced with: bureaucracy.

00:05:12.628 --> 00:05:18.338
Before moving to Sweden, I had pretty extensive experience with bureaucracy in three

00:05:18.338 --> 00:05:25.268
different countries: the UK, Malta, and Italy, so these were my main points of comparison.

00:05:26.178 --> 00:05:30.778
When it comes to bureaucracy and administration, Sweden

00:05:31.098 --> 00:05:35.628
is both infuriatingly complicated and beautifully simple.

00:05:36.948 --> 00:05:41.618
The process of getting into the Swedish “system”, being recognised

00:05:41.618 --> 00:05:45.298
and registered by all of the authorities, can take a while.

00:05:45.858 --> 00:05:49.758
And until you are “in”, it can be very frustrating.

00:05:51.008 --> 00:05:56.448
See, Sweden uses a system called BankID for almost everything.

00:05:57.218 --> 00:06:03.120
It’s an electronic identification system, and to do anything even slightly official,

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:09.460
whether that’s paying taxes or getting a mobile phone contract, you need to have BankID.

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:16.050
You can only get it once you have a bank account from one of the big Swedish banks, which can be

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:22.840
quite difficult to do, and until you have it, you are pretty cut off from all services in Sweden.

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:26.080
Once you have it, though, it's magic.

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:31.550
You don’t need to worry about creating new accounts and remembering passwords or even doing

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:35.950
things like updating your address with every different organisation if you move house.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:41.550
Because it’s all linked to your BankID, which is in turn linked

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.880
to the central Swedish tax system, it all updates automatically.

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:47.020
Like magic.

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:53.240
Now, I don’t want to just list the various bureaucratic systems people use in Sweden.

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:54.950
That would be really boring.

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:59.240
Instead, let me tell you what I think this, in

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:03.240
particular, tells you about Sweden and Swedish society.

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:08.780
Firstly, Swedes pride themselves on convenience.

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:14.920
The country is pretty advanced when it comes to the use of technology, and it is hardly

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:20.800
surprising that technology is used in any way possible to make people’s lives more convenient.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:28.690
Secondly, Sweden works very well if you fit into a common category that is easy to understand,

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:36.740
and if you have circumstances that are less regular, well, life isn’t quite so easy.

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:41.720
To give you an example, my wife has a permanent work contract

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:45.690
with a large state organisation - the University of Gothenburg.

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:51.180
She had a fixed monthly salary, a signed contract, and before that,

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:55.480
she could point to a similar fixed salary and a contract at her

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:59.700
previous employer, another university, albeit in a different country.

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:07.370
Her situation was very easy to understand, and she sailed through all of the bureaucratic hurdles:

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:13.360
registration with the tax authorities, getting a bank account, being able to rent a car, and so on.

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:18.600
I, on the other hand, had a more complicated situation.

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:25.040
I work for myself, I technically worked for a British company called Leonardo English Limited.

00:08:25.383 --> 00:08:29.900
But you can’t do that in Sweden, you have to work for a Swedish-registered company.

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:35.810
So for me to have a work contract, I needed to set up a Swedish company that could employ me.

00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:41.899
Now, I don’t want to bore you with too many really tedious administrative details, but

00:08:42.129 --> 00:08:46.419
I was in a vicious circle for several months where I couldn’t start a Swedish company

00:08:46.719 --> 00:08:51.329
because you can only start one if you have BankID, but you can’t get BankID without

00:08:51.339 --> 00:08:55.819
a bank account, and you can’t get a bank account without an employment contract,

00:08:55.999 --> 00:09:00.199
and for me to get an employment contract, I needed to start a Swedish company.

00:09:01.279 --> 00:09:05.089
It was, as you can imagine, somewhat infuriating,

00:09:05.969 --> 00:09:11.409
Now, I am glad to say it is all sorted but this is just one example of

00:09:11.409 --> 00:09:16.749
how life in Sweden can be a little tricky if you don’t fit neatly into an

00:09:16.839 --> 00:09:21.709
easily-understood category, especially when it comes to your employment status.

00:09:22.839 --> 00:09:29.249
So, with that bureaucratic issue out of the way, let me tell you about something more interesting.

00:09:30.409 --> 00:09:35.859
One thing that people always seem to bang on about when it comes to Sweden is how

00:09:35.859 --> 00:09:41.349
amazing the childcare system is and how it is such a fantastic place to raise kids.

00:09:42.249 --> 00:09:46.689
I have two children, they have spent a year at Swedish nursery, so

00:09:46.989 --> 00:09:51.189
this is a subject I feel I can talk about with some level of authority.

00:09:52.369 --> 00:09:56.869
And in my experience, compared to every other country that I've

00:09:56.889 --> 00:10:00.789
lived in, Sweden is a very easy place to raise children in.

00:10:01.619 --> 00:10:07.259
There is super generous parental leave, which applies to both parents, not just the mother.

00:10:08.029 --> 00:10:15.239
This isn’t just immediately after a child is born, like in many countries, but it can be taken until

00:10:15.239 --> 00:10:23.009
the child is 4, and then you can carry almost 5 months of it over until the child is 12 years old.

00:10:24.554 --> 00:10:27.089
And nursery is practically free.

00:10:27.469 --> 00:10:31.549
Now, it’s not completely free; the cost is based on your

00:10:31.559 --> 00:10:36.629
salary, and the maximum anyone pays is just over €100 a month.

00:10:37.579 --> 00:10:41.759
But the government gives you around this much per child in

00:10:41.759 --> 00:10:46.509
cash every month, so, to all extents and purposes, it is free.

00:10:47.296 --> 00:10:52.816
When you compare this to the UK, for example, where it can easily cost €2,000

00:10:52.816 --> 00:10:57.816
a month per child, well it makes life significantly easier on your wallet.

00:10:58.386 --> 00:11:02.426
But apart from the cost, how is Swedish nursery different?

00:11:02.932 --> 00:11:09.942
Well, one thing you often read in articles about Sweden and other Scandinavian countries is about

00:11:09.942 --> 00:11:16.082
how kids are left to play outside a lot, and they learn to just deal with all types of weather.

00:11:16.972 --> 00:11:23.162
My kids have been in two different nurseries, and I can testify that this seems to be true.

00:11:23.682 --> 00:11:31.062
Whether it’s sunny, pelting it down with rain, or it’s minus 5 outside, the kids go out to play.

00:11:31.962 --> 00:11:37.682
For my kids, two boys who grew up on a sunny Mediterranean island, this was

00:11:37.682 --> 00:11:42.692
a bit of an adjustment, the older one would request gloves at the height of

00:11:42.692 --> 00:11:47.212
Swedish summer, but I am happy to say that they are now getting used to it.

00:11:48.552 --> 00:11:50.632
What else about Swedish nurseries?

00:11:50.862 --> 00:11:56.732
Well, kids in Sweden are taught from a young age to be experimental and independent.

00:11:57.192 --> 00:12:00.662
The kids are encouraged to create their own games, to do

00:12:00.662 --> 00:12:04.382
what they want to do, and to pursue their own interests.

00:12:05.122 --> 00:12:08.152
They call their nursery teachers by their first names,

00:12:08.532 --> 00:12:12.822
and are treated more as equals rather than subjects.

00:12:13.786 --> 00:12:20.052
In Malta, where we were before, it was completely the opposite; kids called their teachers

00:12:20.262 --> 00:12:26.512
Mr or Mrs X, they were given much stricter parameters, games and activities were more

00:12:26.512 --> 00:12:32.177
organised, and  it felt like kids were encouraged to do particular pre-decided things.

00:12:33.507 --> 00:12:38.267
In Sweden, there is much less hierarchy; it seems a lot more flat.

00:12:39.487 --> 00:12:44.447
What’s more, at both of the nurseries my kids have gone to in Sweden, children and

00:12:44.447 --> 00:12:50.137
parents have been strongly encouraged to  get involved with how the nursery is managed.

00:12:50.847 --> 00:12:55.757
The people managing the nursery are very transparent; there are requests

00:12:55.757 --> 00:13:00.867
for feedback and forms to fill out about what suggestions we have, and you

00:13:00.867 --> 00:13:05.217
really get a sense that they want you to feel ownership of the nursery.

00:13:06.517 --> 00:13:13.117
You can see this in multiple areas of Swedish society, from the squash club I joined to

00:13:13.117 --> 00:13:18.187
the apartments we have rented, more than in any other country I’ve lived in before, there

00:13:18.187 --> 00:13:23.997
is this sense that, even if you just use a service–like you send your kids to a nursery

00:13:23.997 --> 00:13:29.827
or you play sport at a sports club–you have a shared responsibility for making it work.

00:13:30.977 --> 00:13:38.317
Now, on this note, let’s talk about this idea of Sweden as some kind of socialist utopia.

00:13:39.167 --> 00:13:42.047
All of the nice stuff the Swedish government gives you,

00:13:42.357 --> 00:13:45.118
especially if you have children, doesn’t come for free.

00:13:45.918 --> 00:13:49.548
And this brings me to the next point, which seems to be one

00:13:49.548 --> 00:13:53.308
of the most common questions people ask me about Sweden: tax.

00:13:54.138 --> 00:14:01.798
Taxes in Sweden are high, some of the highest in the world, reaching up to 57% on personal income.

00:14:02.748 --> 00:14:07.108
And when you factor in the cost the employer pays, they are even

00:14:07.108 --> 00:14:12.418
higher, as a company pays an extra 31% on top of your salary.

00:14:13.698 --> 00:14:19.460
To give you a precise example, if someone in Sweden buys a course for,

00:14:19.611 --> 00:14:25.368
let’s say, €100 from Leonardo English AB, my Swedish company, after

00:14:25.388 --> 00:14:31.346
all taxes are accounted for, I personally might receive around €29.

00:14:31.998 --> 00:14:34.798
And, of course, that doesn’t take into account any other

00:14:34.828 --> 00:14:38.938
costs, so the real amount is considerably lower than that.

00:14:39.698 --> 00:14:44.488
Now, this is not a complaint, but rather a practical, real example.

00:14:45.388 --> 00:14:49.228
And here’s an important clarification that I believe will

00:14:49.228 --> 00:14:53.178
help you better understand how Swedish society is structured.

00:14:53.888 --> 00:15:00.668
Taxes in Sweden are high; they are relatively high for everyone, and the rate at which

00:15:00.678 --> 00:15:06.118
you begin paying the highest tax rate is much lower than in many other countries.

00:15:07.431 --> 00:15:13.817
In the UK, for example, the highest rate of tax, which is 45%, only

00:15:13.817 --> 00:15:20.507
kicks in if you earn more than £125,000, which is around €150,000.

00:15:21.377 --> 00:15:27.207
And if you earn less than €15,000 a year, you don’t pay any tax at all.

00:15:28.617 --> 00:15:36.247
In Sweden, the highest rate of personal tax, at just under 55%, kicks in at 55,000

00:15:36.247 --> 00:15:42.067
Euros, and while there is a tax-free allowance for people only earning 1 or 2 thousand

00:15:42.067 --> 00:15:47.550
Euros a year, there isn’t really the UK equivalent of low earners paying no tax.

00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:54.285
Everyone who works a full-time job, for the most part, pays a minimum of around

00:15:54.345 --> 00:16:00.359
30%, and when you factor in the employer contribution, it’s more like 50%.

00:16:01.317 --> 00:16:07.637
Now, this isn’t a question of what is right or wrong or which system is superior,

00:16:07.987 --> 00:16:14.177
but what this shows is that in Sweden, almost everyone pays a relatively high tax

00:16:14.177 --> 00:16:19.833
rate, whereas in a country like the UK, a higher proportion of the tax is paid by

00:16:19.833 --> 00:16:25.463
people with a large income, and those on lower incomes pay a much smaller amount.

00:16:26.582 --> 00:16:31.472
To give you some more numbers on this, in the UK, the top 1% of

00:16:31.472 --> 00:16:38.222
earners pay almost 30% of all income tax, and in the US, it's even more

00:16:38.222 --> 00:16:43.792
pronounced, at around 40% of taxes being paid by the top 1% of earners.

00:16:44.662 --> 00:16:51.302
Sweden doesn’t publish any similar figures, at least figures that I could find, but Denmark does.

00:16:51.882 --> 00:17:00.222
And in Denmark, which has a similar social structure, the top 1% pays 8% of the total income tax.

00:17:01.132 --> 00:17:06.242
Yes, this also reflects the fact that the top 1% of earners in countries like the UK

00:17:06.242 --> 00:17:12.182
and the US earn vast amounts of money, and incomes are much more unequally distributed.

00:17:12.792 --> 00:17:17.130
But to get back to the example of Sweden, how does this affect a

00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:22.380
society, what is the impact on people when everyone is paying a

00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:26.970
similar percentage in tax, and it is quite a high percentage at that?

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:33.300
Well, from my experience, and from what I have read from people much more experienced and

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:38.950
knowledgeable than me, it leads to people being much more bought into the system, which

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:44.080
leads to a stronger sense of communal responsibility and trust in public institutions.

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:48.940
When most people are contributing at similar, relatively high

00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:52.980
levels, there’s a perception that everyone is in it together.

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:57.740
But here’s something that not everyone knows about Sweden.

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:04.340
It might seem like a socially democratic paradise, and there are very high taxes

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:10.240
on your income, but if you are already wealthy in Sweden, there are few of the

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:15.670
taxes or mechanisms that exist in other countries to redistribute this wealth.

00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:21.220
There is no inheritance tax, taxes on investments are much

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:25.420
lower than on income, there’s no wealth tax or things like that.

00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:31.230
So, for the richest families in Sweden, and there are some very rich,

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:35.630
“old money”, Swedish families, they can happily pass their wealth down

00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:40.510
from generation to generation without having to pay a penny in tax.

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:46.120
While you could say that it’s fair enough that Swedes aren’t taxed again after

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:50.235
they have already been heavily taxed on their income, what this means is that

00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:56.250
there is less potential for social mobility; the rich stay rich, and because the

00:18:56.280 --> 00:19:01.040
tax rate is so high, it's harder to build wealth if you don’t have it already.

00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:06.940
Now, the penultimate thing I want to talk to you about today is related to Swedish

00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:12.690
culture, and how this relates to several other countries I feel I can speak with some

00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:19.240
authority about: the UK, where I’m from, Malta, where I lived for the last 7 years,

00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:24.550
and Italy, where I've spent quite a long time living and the country my wife is from.

00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:31.840
Sweden is this curious mix of relatively small country, with just over

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:36.800
10 million people, highly developed but only really in the past 100

00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:42.351
years or so, and until pretty recently very culturally homogenous.

00:19:43.701 --> 00:19:48.091
Its size means that there is enough of a domestic market for people

00:19:48.091 --> 00:19:53.091
to write books or make movies or make music in Swedish, for Swedish

00:19:53.091 --> 00:19:58.141
people, but there aren’t so many people that there is an abundance of it.

00:19:59.141 --> 00:20:05.021
If you contrast this with Malta, for example, the population is so small that there is

00:20:05.021 --> 00:20:11.451
pretty much no domestic market for cultural products: songs, books, cartoons, and so on.

00:20:12.381 --> 00:20:16.111
And you contrast this with Italy, there is a bigger market.

00:20:16.751 --> 00:20:23.293
Italy also has centuries of being a relatively rich country, and for most of that time

00:20:23.443 --> 00:20:28.453
it was a collection of very different cultures all within the borders of modern Italy.

00:20:29.503 --> 00:20:33.991
And then the UK, a bigger country still, plus with a shared

00:20:34.021 --> 00:20:37.942
global language and a much longer history of multiculturalism.

00:20:39.262 --> 00:20:45.037
As a newcomer to the UK or to Italy, there is so much cultural history

00:20:45.037 --> 00:20:50.601
and cultural output that I imagine it takes an awfully long time to

00:20:50.601 --> 00:20:55.601
really understand and process before things start to feel familiar.

00:20:56.851 --> 00:21:01.631
Sweden, on the other hand, seems to me a lot more manageable.

00:21:02.417 --> 00:21:06.645
There are certain Swedish traditions that all my Swedish friends participate

00:21:06.655 --> 00:21:12.255
in, songs that all Swedish children seem to know, it seems to me to be a much

00:21:12.255 --> 00:21:17.912
more cohesive, smaller and therefore more easily accessible cultural landscape.

00:21:19.052 --> 00:21:23.832
Of course, this is a generalisation, but it is my experience so far.

00:21:24.336 --> 00:21:27.189
And, I have to say, it is quite nice.

00:21:27.904 --> 00:21:31.794
I would go to Swedish language class, and we’d learn the lyrics of a

00:21:31.794 --> 00:21:36.155
Christmas song, I’d then find that my kids also knew the song, I’d hear

00:21:36.195 --> 00:21:40.642
other children singing it in the tram, and I’d hear it being played in shops.

00:21:41.352 --> 00:21:44.582
Yes, I’m sure the same thing happens in many other countries,

00:21:44.802 --> 00:21:48.002
but it is something that my wife and I have both observed.

00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:52.100
Now, the final thing to talk about, given that you are

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:55.830
learning English, is my experience learning Swedish.

00:21:56.730 --> 00:22:00.570
As you may know, I have learned several other languages - I studied

00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:03.770
French and Italian at university, I have spent quite a lot of time in

00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:08.360
China and did a Masters in Chinese, but this was quite a long time ago.

00:22:09.201 --> 00:22:13.831
I started learning Swedish last year, and completely from scratch.

00:22:14.121 --> 00:22:16.641
I didn’t know a word of Swedish beforehand.

00:22:17.491 --> 00:22:23.651
And I have to say, being a complete beginner was very humbling, and reminded me of

00:22:23.651 --> 00:22:28.618
the fantastic effort that all of you are making in improving your English, and how

00:22:28.638 --> 00:22:33.698
difficult it can be to find the time or motivation to actually put in the work.

00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:40.360
Studying Swedish myself reminded me that there are no shortcuts, no special

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:45.270
tricks or solutions that will somehow make you learn a language 50 times faster,

00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:50.260
or that can get you to fluency in 30 days or something ridiculous like that.

00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:57.470
It’s a long and steady process, and having used myself as a guinea pig for the past 12

00:22:57.470 --> 00:23:02.650
months, the only thing that I can say is guaranteed to work is regular, daily practice.

00:23:03.290 --> 00:23:08.280
It’s time-consuming, it’s less sexy than a shortcut, but it will work.

00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:12.910
So, there we go, these are some reflections on 12

00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:15.950
months spent calling this Scandinavian nation home.

00:23:16.709 --> 00:23:17.719
Will it be home forever?

00:23:18.352 --> 00:23:22.142
Who knows, but it certainly isn’t a bad place for now.

00:23:23.752 --> 00:23:29.592
OK then, that is it for today's slightly atypical episode about my life in Sweden.

00:23:29.962 --> 00:23:32.389
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you might have

00:23:32.389 --> 00:23:35.199
learned a few things about Sweden that you didn’t know before.

00:23:35.786 --> 00:23:38.496
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:23:38.906 --> 00:23:41.106
Do you have questions for me about Sweden?

00:23:41.477 --> 00:23:47.367
We actually have quite a few members from Sweden or who live in Sweden, so what do you think?

00:23:47.407 --> 00:23:49.667
What would you agree or disagree with?

00:23:50.377 --> 00:23:55.530
And I’m not going to make these more personal episodes a permanent thing, but do you

00:23:55.530 --> 00:24:00.180
like these kinds of updates, or do you think, “Meh, get back to the more exciting stuff?”

00:24:00.754 --> 00:24:04.565
I’d love to know, so feel free to shoot me an email or dive right
