Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.110
English, the show where you can listen to fascinating stories and learn weird

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.680
and wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:27.479
I'm Alastair Budge, and today, we are going to be talking about the creation of the metric system.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.249
All around the world, with a few notable exceptions, the vast majority

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.200
of the world’s population uses the same system to measure stuff.

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:40.372
Metres, grammes, litres.

00:00:40.752 --> 00:00:45.710
It's something we take for granted, but it is, of course, a man-made creation.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.520
So, in this episode, we are going to dive into the wonderful, unlikely,

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.590
revolutionary, but not absolutely perfect story of the metric system.

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.370
Right, let’s not waste a minute and get right into it.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.300
The other day, I was talking with a Swedish friend.

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.149
We were talking about different cities in Sweden,

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.480
and he mentioned that a town was only 20 miles away.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:22.070
My first reaction was, “Wow, my Swedish geography is really bad, I thought

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.990
the town we were talking about was a lot further away than 20 miles”.

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:34.080
And then I thought, “Hang on, why is this Swede talking about miles? I thought that

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.330
was something only the Brits and Americans used, a hangover from many centuries ago?”

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.960
Seeing the confusion on my face, he corrected himself, “Swedish

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.030
miles, I mean. A Swedish mile is 10 kilometres”, he added.

00:01:50.339 --> 00:01:54.850
In case you weren’t aware, as I wasn’t, there is such a thing

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.440
as a Swedish mile, or a Scandinavian mile, as it’s also known.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:08.022
It is exactly 10 kilometres, and it is still a commonly used measurement in Sweden and Norway.

00:02:09.362 --> 00:02:13.771
Thankfully, it is relatively easy to understand, and you can

00:02:13.801 --> 00:02:18.131
quickly translate this to kilometres by adding a zero to the end.

00:02:18.751 --> 00:02:20.641
Simple, once you know what you’re doing.

00:02:21.711 --> 00:02:27.581
But imagine a world in which every country, every city, and in some

00:02:27.581 --> 00:02:33.201
cases, every town or even village had a different unit of measurement.

00:02:33.681 --> 00:02:37.941
What I might call a “mile” is a slightly different length to what

00:02:37.941 --> 00:02:41.921
you might call “a mile”, or you might not call it a mile at all.

00:02:42.521 --> 00:02:47.361
It would be chaos, but for much of human history, in many countries,

00:02:47.651 --> 00:02:52.511
this was the case, not just for distances but for practically everything.

00:02:53.951 --> 00:02:58.711
In pre-revolutionary France, for example, if you travelled just a short

00:02:58.721 --> 00:03:05.431
distance, you might find a new foot, a different pound, and a host of other local

00:03:05.431 --> 00:03:11.521
measurements with baffling names and ever-so-slightly varying lengths or weights.

00:03:12.057 --> 00:03:15.873
It was confusing, and made trade more complicated.

00:03:16.533 --> 00:03:20.613
Buyers and sellers never knew if they were getting a fair deal.

00:03:21.713 --> 00:03:28.313
It was such a problem that in some countries, Sweden, for example, the crime of falsifying

00:03:28.313 --> 00:03:34.343
weights or measurements was even made a capital offence, it was punishable by death.

00:03:35.723 --> 00:03:39.993
Across Europe, royal edicts had tried to impose common

00:03:39.993 --> 00:03:43.123
standards for measurements, but they rarely stuck.

00:03:43.653 --> 00:03:49.233
There were just too many competing local traditions, each with its proud defenders.

00:03:50.503 --> 00:03:57.353
And the measurements were often based on inexact objects in the real world.

00:03:58.163 --> 00:04:04.463
A common example is the cubit, the unit of measurement used in Ancient Egypt that

00:04:04.463 --> 00:04:10.089
was defined as the length between someone’s elbow and the tip of their middle finger.

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:17.449
Everyone has an elbow and a middle finger, but this is not an exact, universal measurement.

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:24.089
My “cubit” is different from your “cubit”, so it is an inexact measurement.

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:30.579
In the UK, we still use “feet” to measure certain distances, like height

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:36.089
or the dimensions of rooms, and horses are still measured in “hands”.

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:40.396
It isn’t too hard to figure out where those came from, but

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:44.419
they are imperfect because they vary from person to person.

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:52.081
So, for a unit of measurement to be perfect, for it to be indisputable, it needs

00:04:52.101 --> 00:04:58.171
to come from somewhere or something that was universally observable and applicable.

00:04:58.591 --> 00:05:00.871
Something that never changed.

00:05:01.791 --> 00:05:04.951
Now, let us move into the late 18th century.

00:05:05.581 --> 00:05:09.301
In France, revolutionary fever was in the air.

00:05:09.921 --> 00:05:14.271
The old institutions were under attack, and the leaders of the

00:05:14.271 --> 00:05:19.441
new France believed society had to be rebuilt from the ground up.

00:05:19.871 --> 00:05:24.771
Laws, religion, social structures—everything needed reform.

00:05:25.911 --> 00:05:32.501
And right at the heart of this spirit of change was an ambitious plan: to

00:05:32.511 --> 00:05:37.191
unify the chaotic patchwork of French measurements by creating a system

00:05:37.491 --> 00:05:43.952
that would be universal, scientific, and, crucially, based on nature itself.

00:05:44.682 --> 00:05:48.692
No more random definitions like the length of a king’s

00:05:48.692 --> 00:05:52.012
foot or the weight of a stone from a particular riverbank.

00:05:52.462 --> 00:05:55.982
It would come from somewhere that could be verified by anyone,

00:05:56.242 --> 00:06:01.452
or rather any scientist, anywhere, at any point in time.

00:06:02.652 --> 00:06:10.032
The answer was right under their feet; everything would come directly from the size of the Earth.

00:06:11.352 --> 00:06:17.442
They would call it the “metric” system, and the unit of measurement would be the “metre”.

00:06:18.272 --> 00:06:24.108
The name was chosen from the Greek word μετρέω, meaning to measure or count.

00:06:25.508 --> 00:06:32.158
The work began in 1792, when the French National Convention charged two

00:06:32.168 --> 00:06:37.704
astronomers, Pierre Méchain and Jean-Baptiste Delambre, with a daunting mission:

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:44.424
to measure the distance between Dunkirk in northern France and Barcelona in Spain.

00:06:45.905 --> 00:06:48.665
Why these two places, you might be thinking?

00:06:49.145 --> 00:06:54.355
Well, it was because these two locations were on the same longitude.

00:06:54.935 --> 00:07:00.555
Importantly, they were on the Paris Meridian, the French equivalent to the now more

00:07:00.595 --> 00:07:06.255
popular Greenwich Meridian, which is a straight line going directly from north to south.

00:07:07.725 --> 00:07:14.875
If you were to draw a line from the North Pole to Paris, then it would have passed through Dunkirk.

00:07:15.525 --> 00:07:20.645
And if you kept going all the way to the South Pole, you would pass directly

00:07:20.645 --> 00:07:26.485
through Barcelona, or to be precise, Castell de Montjuïc in Barcelona.

00:07:27.425 --> 00:07:31.145
This was the distance that the two men were tasked with measuring.

00:07:32.021 --> 00:07:36.705
But how would this help them come up with the distance for a metre, you might well ask?

00:07:37.449 --> 00:07:42.529
The idea was to use this measurement—from Dunkirk to Barcelona—to

00:07:42.569 --> 00:07:47.219
estimate the total distance from the North Pole to the Equator.

00:07:48.139 --> 00:07:51.679
Astronomers already knew what fraction of that total

00:07:51.679 --> 00:07:55.439
distance the Dunkirk-Barcelona segment represented.

00:07:55.939 --> 00:08:03.629
And by extrapolating this proportion, they could calculate the full pole-to-equator distance.

00:08:04.389 --> 00:08:08.079
They would then divide this distance into 10 million

00:08:08.079 --> 00:08:12.469
units, and each of those units would be called a metre.

00:08:13.649 --> 00:08:20.009
This would mean that the circumference of the Earth would be exactly 40 million metres.

00:08:20.859 --> 00:08:25.449
Remember that, as we’ll address this in more detail a little bit later on.

00:08:26.449 --> 00:08:33.634
Anyway, this might all sound elegant in theory, but this was in 1792.

00:08:34.399 --> 00:08:38.589
How were they actually going to measure the distance between these two points?

00:08:39.079 --> 00:08:43.499
They couldn’t just walk from Dunkirk to Barcelona with a long piece of rope.

00:08:44.309 --> 00:08:51.677
Today, we know—thanks to modern satellite technology—that this distance is 1,075 kilometres.

00:08:52.117 --> 00:08:57.327
But Méchain and Delambre had to calculate it from scratch,

00:08:57.707 --> 00:09:02.107
and from that, determine the precise length of a metre.

00:09:03.397 --> 00:09:07.907
As you can probably appreciate, Méchain and Delambre were tasked

00:09:07.917 --> 00:09:11.687
with one of the most challenging surveying operations in history.

00:09:12.867 --> 00:09:20.314
To calculate the distance, they used the method of triangulation, which involves taking angular

00:09:20.314 --> 00:09:27.954
readings from carefully chosen high points—church spires, mountaintops, and miscellaneous tall

00:09:27.954 --> 00:09:36.140
buildings—and then they used geometry to calculate exact distances over large expanses of land.

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:42.260
Essentially, they stood in one high place, observed two points of

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:46.259
interest in the distance, and measured the angles between them.

00:09:47.139 --> 00:09:52.929
But because this was imperfect, they would measure the angles from multiple

00:09:52.949 --> 00:09:58.680
different places, and use all of those calculations to reduce the margin for error.

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:06.910
And they would do this over and over and over, moving all the way from Dunkirk to Barcelona.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:14.960
Or technically, Delambre did the northern part, from Dunkirk to a town called Rodez in central

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:21.570
France, and Méchain was responsible for the southern part, from Rodez down to Barcelona.

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:28.680
Even though they divided the work, it was incredibly laborious, requiring delicate

00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:34.930
instruments and precise observations, often repeated many times to eliminate errors.

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:42.370
And these instruments were cumbersome: they were heavy brass and steel devices that had

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:48.800
to be carried up hills, across rivers, and through towns in the midst of political unrest.

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:54.500
Remember, this was all taking place in the middle of the French Revolution.

00:10:55.280 --> 00:11:01.783
France declared war on Austria in 1792, the year Méchain and Delambre had set out.

00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:07.690
The following year, King Louis XVI was tried and guillotined; the year after

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:12.950
that, Robespierre, one of the revolutionaries, was overthrown and executed.

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:20.100
It was the most turbulent political climate in French history, so one can just imagine Méchain

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:25.540
and Delambre trying to explain to suspicious locals why they were standing on their church

00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:31.460
roof at three o’clock in the morning, fiddling with a strange-looking metallic contraption.

00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:36.170
And it wasn’t just the human component that they were up against.

00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:42.540
The two scientists also had to deal with the fact that the Earth is not a perfect sphere.

00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:48.390
It’s technically something called an oblate spheroid, meaning it bulges

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:52.480
slightly around the Equator like it has had a little too much for lunch.

00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:58.930
This makes measuring an arc of the Earth’s meridian trickier than you might think.

00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:06.280
It was a gargantuan effort, and every small error in the angles, every imprecise

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:12.680
reading, would multiply over hundreds of kilometres, so they had to be meticulous.

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:18.742
They repeated each measurement multiple times under different  conditions—morning,

00:12:19.132 --> 00:12:25.922
afternoon, nighttime, clear skies, cloudy skies—always cross-checking for tiny differences.

00:12:26.702 --> 00:12:30.412
They kept notebooks full of corrections for temperature

00:12:30.412 --> 00:12:33.842
changes that could affect the metal in their instruments.

00:12:34.742 --> 00:12:40.552
They also had to correct for atmospheric refraction, the way light bends

00:12:40.552 --> 00:12:44.572
slightly as it travels through layers of air with different densities.

00:12:45.342 --> 00:12:51.392
Any slip-up, any mistake, could lead to a miscalculation of the final metre.

00:12:52.382 --> 00:12:56.882
But perhaps the scientific part, the observations and the

00:12:56.882 --> 00:13:00.512
calculations, were not the greatest challenge the pair faced.

00:13:01.402 --> 00:13:06.662
One of the most serious obstacles faced was actually on the Spanish side of the

00:13:06.662 --> 00:13:11.872
border, where Méchain had to deal with local suspicion during a time of war.

00:13:12.972 --> 00:13:18.592
He had the requisite papers with details of his mission, but he was frequently

00:13:18.592 --> 00:13:24.675
mistaken for a spy, someone measuring fortifications or planning a military route.

00:13:25.245 --> 00:13:28.895
He was arrested, hassled, and delayed for months.

00:13:29.915 --> 00:13:34.115
Meanwhile, Delambre, on his northern journey, was often

00:13:34.115 --> 00:13:38.268
met with confusion or outright hostility from villagers.

00:13:39.485 --> 00:13:46.215
Despite all of this, the pair inched closer to their goal with extraordinary determination.

00:13:47.095 --> 00:13:55.695
By 1798, after almost seven years of gruelling, nerve-wracking work, the two astronomers finally

00:13:55.705 --> 00:14:02.035
had enough data to calculate the length of the meridian arc and, with it, define the metre.

00:14:03.505 --> 00:14:09.879
The calculations were complete, and the true distance of a metre could finally be unveiled.

00:14:10.999 --> 00:14:14.129
For the first time in history, there would be a universal

00:14:14.129 --> 00:14:17.619
measurement based on the circumference of the Earth.

00:14:18.839 --> 00:14:25.863
In 1799, a platinum bar was cast to represent this new standard.

00:14:26.519 --> 00:14:31.459
That bar, known as the “mètre des Archives,” became the reference point for

00:14:31.509 --> 00:14:36.259
all future measurements, and this is where it gets even more interesting.

00:14:37.349 --> 00:14:45.396
Once the metre was set, scientists could define a smaller unit, the decimetre—one-tenth of a metre.

00:14:46.409 --> 00:14:54.260
A cube that measured one decimetre on each side was declared to be one litre in volume.

00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:57.707
Ta-da, a new universal measurement of volume.

00:14:58.587 --> 00:15:03.297
Then, the weight of a litre of water at a specified temperature

00:15:03.817 --> 00:15:08.637
[close to 4°C] was considered to be exactly one kilogramme.

00:15:09.187 --> 00:15:11.997
And ta-da, a new measurement of weight.

00:15:13.187 --> 00:15:22.170
Suddenly, length, volume, and mass were all interlinked, rooted in a single measurement: the metre.

00:15:23.597 --> 00:15:28.367
And because everything was in multiples of ten, conversions

00:15:28.517 --> 00:15:33.167
were vastly simpler than in the old imperial or local systems.

00:15:33.517 --> 00:15:42.157
No more 12 inches in a foot, 3 feet in a yard, 1,760 yards in a mile; now it was

00:15:42.197 --> 00:15:48.957
tens, hundreds, and thousands—a clean, decimal arrangement that anyone but the most

00:15:49.037 --> 00:15:55.097
ardent supporter of pounds, feet and gallons can recognise as a superior system.

00:15:56.507 --> 00:16:02.607
Of course, theory and practice don’t always align immediately, and plenty

00:16:02.607 --> 00:16:07.505
of people in France, especially in rural areas, resisted the new system.

00:16:08.335 --> 00:16:14.955
Napoleon himself, seeing how unpopular it could be, allowed many of the old measures to stay in use.

00:16:15.852 --> 00:16:21.891
But the metric system was already out in the world, and it was only a matter of time

00:16:22.171 --> 00:16:28.191
before its clarity and simplicity caught the attention of scientists in other countries.

00:16:29.301 --> 00:16:33.881
Throughout the 19th century, the idea of a universal, decimal-based

00:16:33.881 --> 00:16:37.441
system of measurement spread across Europe and beyond.

00:16:38.311 --> 00:16:42.261
Newly independent countries in Latin America adopted it as

00:16:42.261 --> 00:16:46.421
a mark of modernity and a break from colonial influences.

00:16:47.411 --> 00:16:52.601
By the late 1800s, the metric system had become a near-global concern,

00:16:53.111 --> 00:16:59.711
and in 1875, seventeen countries signed the Metre Convention, setting

00:16:59.711 --> 00:17:03.561
up the International Bureau of Weights and Measures near Paris.

00:17:04.351 --> 00:17:08.041
Even the United States, which still clings to miles

00:17:08.041 --> 00:17:11.411
and pounds in daily life, was a founding signatory.

00:17:12.862 --> 00:17:17.858
And over the next century, definitions became even more precise.

00:17:18.838 --> 00:17:22.288
Originally, the metre was defined by a platinum

00:17:22.288 --> 00:17:27.538
bar—literally a metal stick kept under lock and key in Paris.

00:17:28.088 --> 00:17:33.298
If anything happened to that bar—if it got a tiny scratch, or if

00:17:33.298 --> 00:17:38.032
the metal warped over time—our definition of the metre would change.

00:17:38.722 --> 00:17:44.162
Scientists realised that basing the metre on a single physical object wasn’t

00:17:44.192 --> 00:17:50.772
ideal, so in 1983, they redefined the metre using the speed of light in

00:17:50.772 --> 00:17:54.892
a vacuum, which is one of the most reliable properties in the universe.

00:17:55.802 --> 00:18:07.152
We say that the metre is the distance light travels in 1/299,792,458 of a second.

00:18:08.502 --> 00:18:12.232
Because the speed of light doesn’t change, we get an incredibly

00:18:12.252 --> 00:18:17.012
precise, unchanging definition of what a metre actually is.

00:18:18.052 --> 00:18:21.302
And a similar logic applies to the kilogramme.

00:18:22.282 --> 00:18:29.162
For a long time, the official kilogramme was a platinum-iridium cylinder, also kept in Paris.

00:18:30.202 --> 00:18:35.702
Just like the metre bar, any tiny imperfection or contamination

00:18:36.032 --> 00:18:40.572
could change its mass, even if only by an infinitesimal amount.

00:18:41.612 --> 00:18:48.152
So, in 2019, scientists decided to define the kilogramme in terms

00:18:48.172 --> 00:18:52.589
of Planck's constant, a fundamental number in quantum physics.

00:18:53.769 --> 00:19:00.181
If we measure Planck's constant accurately and link it to the idea of mass, we get a

00:19:00.181 --> 00:19:05.611
definition of the kilogramme that doesn’t rely on a single metal cylinder sitting in a vault.

00:19:06.271 --> 00:19:13.201
It’s tied, instead, to a property of the universe that remains the same no matter where you go.

00:19:14.141 --> 00:19:19.261
This can all be traced back to Méchain and Delambre’s incredible precision.

00:19:20.021 --> 00:19:25.291
But, and it is a big but, they did make a tiny mistake.

00:19:26.461 --> 00:19:31.921
As you’ll remember, they had intended the distance from the North Pole to the equator to be

00:19:31.961 --> 00:19:40.301
exactly ten million metres, making the Earth’s polar circumference exactly 40 million metres.

00:19:41.391 --> 00:19:44.791
That figure was close, but not exact.

00:19:45.941 --> 00:19:52.351
Thanks to a series of tiny errors—some the result of the Earth’s irregular shape, others

00:19:52.361 --> 00:19:58.831
from errors in the triangulation work—the final calculation was off by a few hundred metres.

00:20:00.261 --> 00:20:07.309
And if you trace the sources of this discrepancy, most fingers point to Pierre Méchain.

00:20:08.242 --> 00:20:14.132
He was an obsessively meticulous man who discovered inconsistencies in his results but

00:20:14.492 --> 00:20:20.142
never fully corrected them, partly out of fear of undermining the entire endeavour.

00:20:21.522 --> 00:20:27.132
As more precise measurements emerged in the decades and centuries that followed, scientists

00:20:27.132 --> 00:20:33.402
realised that the meridian distance should have been slightly larger, meaning our

00:20:33.402 --> 00:20:40.612
metre–the metre that you and I know–turned out to be just a fraction smaller than intended.

00:20:41.962 --> 00:20:44.772
But by then, it was too late.

00:20:45.402 --> 00:20:49.642
The metre had already become the reference for countless measurements,

00:20:49.932 --> 00:20:55.242
scientific instruments, legal contracts, textbooks, and everyday transactions.

00:20:56.072 --> 00:21:01.362
There were discussions about fixing it—simply readjusting the value so

00:21:01.362 --> 00:21:06.482
that the polar circumference lined up perfectly with 40 million metres—but

00:21:06.862 --> 00:21:11.442
doing so would have rendered every existing metre stick obsolete.

00:21:12.152 --> 00:21:16.292
Redefining the metre in that way would have caused enormous disruption.

00:21:17.342 --> 00:21:21.199
Instead, the world decided to keep the metre as it was.

00:21:21.979 --> 00:21:27.049
After all, it was only a fraction of a millimetre off per metre, which

00:21:27.049 --> 00:21:31.069
was more than accurate enough for 18th-century practical purposes.

00:21:32.289 --> 00:21:37.079
Later refinements to the definition of the metre, like tying it to the speed of light,

00:21:37.589 --> 00:21:42.859
have made it infinitely more precise, but the original length is still the same.

00:21:44.029 --> 00:21:48.559
In other words, Méchain’s tiny error became enshrined in history.

00:21:49.269 --> 00:21:54.179
The Earth isn’t exactly 40 million metres in circumference, but

00:21:54.449 --> 00:21:58.179
the metric system has worked so well that it doesn’t really matter.

00:21:59.299 --> 00:22:02.739
It was a small price to pay for the simplicity and

00:22:02.739 --> 00:22:06.349
universality that the metric system brought to the world.

00:22:07.749 --> 00:22:11.939
OK then, that is it for today's episode on the metric

00:22:11.939 --> 00:22:16.229
system, and the story of how and why a metre is a metre.
