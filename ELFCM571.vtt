Hello, hello, hello, and welcome

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:09.919
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.860
Minds, by Leonardo English, the show

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.599
where you can listen to fascinating

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:16.959
stories and learn weird and wonderful

00:00:16.969 --> 00:00:18.890
things about the world at the same

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.680
time as improving your English.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.780
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.270
going to be talking about the hijacking

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.289
of the cruise ship, the Achille Lauro.

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:31.939
It’s a story that brings together

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:35.120
terrorism, guns, grenades, the Middle

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.650
East, and a diplomatic incident that

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.970
almost caused two close NATO allies

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.550
to turn their guns on each other.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.980
So, let’s not waste a minute

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:47.490
and get right into it.

00:00:48.814 --> 00:00:52.114
If you look up the definition of “cruise

00:00:52.164 --> 00:00:54.984
ship” in a dictionary, you’ll probably

00:00:54.984 --> 00:00:57.944
find something like “a large ship that

00:00:57.944 --> 00:01:00.534
carries people on voyages for pleasure,

00:01:00.964 --> 00:01:03.484
typically calling in at several places”.

00:01:04.874 --> 00:01:07.314
For one American couple, Leon

00:01:07.314 --> 00:01:10.104
Klinghoffer and his wife Marilyn, this

00:01:10.144 --> 00:01:12.104
was exactly what they were hoping for.

00:01:13.144 --> 00:01:15.894
They were celebrating their 36th wedding

00:01:15.894 --> 00:01:18.804
anniversary and bought a ticket on the

00:01:18.834 --> 00:01:21.654
Achille Lauro, a large ship that would

00:01:21.664 --> 00:01:24.434
take them from Genoa in northern Italy,

00:01:24.594 --> 00:01:26.704
around the Mediterranean, stopping at

00:01:26.704 --> 00:01:29.474
Naples and Syracuse, then continuing

00:01:29.474 --> 00:01:32.554
to Egypt, Israel, Cyprus and Greece,

00:01:32.904 --> 00:01:36.324
before returning to Genoa 11 days later.

00:01:37.054 --> 00:01:40.374
It would be a wonderful trip, one that

00:01:40.374 --> 00:01:43.704
was firmly in the “for pleasure” category.

00:01:44.824 --> 00:01:47.384
Leon Klinghoffer, however, would

00:01:47.394 --> 00:01:49.114
never make it off the ship.

00:01:49.794 --> 00:01:51.164
Or at least, would never

00:01:51.164 --> 00:01:53.074
make it off the ship alive.

00:01:54.014 --> 00:01:58.344
On October 14, 1985, his lifeless

00:01:58.344 --> 00:02:01.884
body washed up on a Syrian beach, with

00:02:01.894 --> 00:02:05.054
gunshot wounds to the head and chest.

00:02:06.204 --> 00:02:10.157
Eleven days beforehand, he and 750

00:02:10.191 --> 00:02:12.834
or so other passengers had embarked

00:02:12.854 --> 00:02:14.744
at Genoa, in northern Italy.

00:02:15.924 --> 00:02:19.184
The ship wasn’t a classic luxury liner,

00:02:19.534 --> 00:02:21.764
but it was perfectly well-equipped:

00:02:22.264 --> 00:02:24.234
two swimming pools on the roof, a

00:02:24.244 --> 00:02:27.314
cinema, a gym, and cabins with private

00:02:27.314 --> 00:02:29.424
balconies, which were something of a

00:02:29.434 --> 00:02:31.944
novelty for cruise ships at that time.

00:02:33.094 --> 00:02:36.224
Most of the passengers were Italian–it

00:02:36.224 --> 00:02:37.454
was an Italian cruise liner after

00:02:37.454 --> 00:02:40.214
all–but there were some Brits

00:02:40.254 --> 00:02:42.294
and Americans too, as well as a

00:02:42.304 --> 00:02:44.564
smattering of other nationalities.

00:02:45.224 --> 00:02:47.774
There were also four young men

00:02:47.824 --> 00:02:49.814
who kept themselves to themselves.

00:02:50.644 --> 00:02:52.814
One of them had been on the same

00:02:52.814 --> 00:02:55.274
cruise a few times before, which

00:02:55.434 --> 00:02:58.234
seemed odd, but he had a valid ticket.

00:02:59.504 --> 00:03:02.304
A member of staff recognised him and,

00:03:02.634 --> 00:03:04.414
trying to strike up a conversation,

00:03:04.884 --> 00:03:06.194
asked him where he was from.

00:03:07.134 --> 00:03:09.274
He didn’t seem very interested in talking

00:03:09.804 --> 00:03:12.604
and replied with one word: Norwegian.

00:03:13.884 --> 00:03:16.394
This also seemed a little odd,

00:03:16.574 --> 00:03:19.234
as he didn’t have classic Nordic

00:03:19.234 --> 00:03:22.444
features: he had dark hair and olive

00:03:22.444 --> 00:03:25.184
skin, he looked more like a southern

00:03:25.184 --> 00:03:27.174
Italian or someone from the Middle

00:03:27.174 --> 00:03:29.634
East than someone from Scandinavia.

00:03:30.724 --> 00:03:32.644
Another member of the group, when

00:03:32.644 --> 00:03:35.044
asked, said that he was Argentinian,

00:03:35.504 --> 00:03:38.204
but he didn’t seem to understand when

00:03:38.204 --> 00:03:40.304
a passenger engaged him in Spanish.

00:03:41.454 --> 00:03:44.444
Odd, again, but the men had valid

00:03:44.504 --> 00:03:46.654
tickets, they were paying customers.

00:03:47.124 --> 00:03:48.534
Perhaps they simply

00:03:48.534 --> 00:03:49.994
preferred their own company.

00:03:51.174 --> 00:03:54.164
On Monday, October 7th, four days

00:03:54.274 --> 00:03:56.744
after setting off, and after stops

00:03:56.744 --> 00:03:59.394
in Naples and Syracuse, the cruise

00:03:59.424 --> 00:04:03.064
ship pulled into Alexandria in Egypt.

00:04:04.484 --> 00:04:06.104
The plan was for the

00:04:06.124 --> 00:04:08.464
passengers to disembark and

00:04:08.474 --> 00:04:10.124
go on a tour of the pyramids.

00:04:10.794 --> 00:04:13.164
While this was happening, the ship would

00:04:13.164 --> 00:04:15.734
make its way to Port Said, a couple of

00:04:15.734 --> 00:04:18.244
hundred kilometres to the east, and the

00:04:18.254 --> 00:04:21.024
passengers would rejoin the ship there.

00:04:22.374 --> 00:04:23.884
And sure enough, most of the

00:04:23.884 --> 00:04:26.104
passengers got off, climbed into

00:04:26.104 --> 00:04:28.904
buses and headed off to visit one

00:04:28.904 --> 00:04:30.824
of the seven wonders of the world.

00:04:32.204 --> 00:04:34.744
Just shy of 100 passengers

00:04:34.964 --> 00:04:35.994
remained on board.

00:04:37.014 --> 00:04:39.284
Shortly afterwards, the four

00:04:39.594 --> 00:04:43.094
quiet, odd, men revealed themselves

00:04:43.154 --> 00:04:45.404
as not so innocent after all.

00:04:46.794 --> 00:04:48.964
As the remaining passengers were having

00:04:48.964 --> 00:04:51.004
their lunch in the ship’s dining room,

00:04:51.414 --> 00:04:53.994
the men charged into the room with machine

00:04:53.994 --> 00:04:56.584
guns, firing their weapons in the air.

00:04:57.574 --> 00:04:59.594
There were shrieks and cries

00:04:59.694 --> 00:05:01.284
from the terrified passengers.

00:05:01.724 --> 00:05:03.584
The men were heavily armed:

00:05:03.964 --> 00:05:06.334
guns, grenades, and ammunition

00:05:06.404 --> 00:05:08.444
wrapped around their waists.

00:05:09.274 --> 00:05:11.274
Quickly, they rounded up all the

00:05:11.274 --> 00:05:13.864
passengers on board and frogmarched

00:05:13.874 --> 00:05:15.594
them into the dining room.

00:05:16.934 --> 00:05:18.404
The ship’s captain was called

00:05:18.654 --> 00:05:20.684
and instructed to set sail

00:05:20.934 --> 00:05:23.747
for the Syrian port of Tartus.

00:05:24.754 --> 00:05:26.964
The captain had no option but to

00:05:26.964 --> 00:05:30.014
obey, and the ship steamed northwards.

00:05:31.474 --> 00:05:34.654
At the beginning, it was unclear who

00:05:34.664 --> 00:05:37.084
these men were and what they wanted.

00:05:38.334 --> 00:05:41.144
Their motivations seemed to be

00:05:41.264 --> 00:05:43.074
political, as they said things

00:05:43.074 --> 00:05:46.194
like “Reagan no good, Arafat good”.

00:05:47.304 --> 00:05:49.624
Yasser Arafat, as you may remember,

00:05:49.844 --> 00:05:51.604
was the leader of the Palestinian

00:05:51.624 --> 00:05:54.467
Liberation Organisation, the PLO.

00:05:55.061 --> 00:05:58.404
But the men hadn’t made any demands; they

00:05:58.604 --> 00:06:01.654
hadn’t explicitly stated what they wanted.

00:06:02.234 --> 00:06:04.584
It was also unclear how many

00:06:04.584 --> 00:06:06.364
attackers were on board the ship.

00:06:07.124 --> 00:06:09.164
They told the captain there were twenty of

00:06:09.164 --> 00:06:11.674
them, but the captain could only see four.

00:06:12.984 --> 00:06:14.964
And in fact, this claim of twenty

00:06:15.034 --> 00:06:17.624
was a bluff; there were only four.

00:06:19.054 --> 00:06:21.954
The men instructed the ship’s crew to

00:06:21.954 --> 00:06:25.064
continue as if everything was normal, not

00:06:25.134 --> 00:06:28.334
to send out any sign of distress or notify

00:06:28.334 --> 00:06:30.504
the coastguard that anything had happened.

00:06:31.214 --> 00:06:33.834
But before they had the chance to shut

00:06:33.834 --> 00:06:36.064
down the radio systems, an officer

00:06:36.084 --> 00:06:38.644
on the ship was able to send out an

00:06:38.694 --> 00:06:41.624
SOS message, which was picked up by a

00:06:41.624 --> 00:06:43.794
monitoring station all the way up in

00:06:43.794 --> 00:06:46.654
Sweden, in Gothenburg, to be precise.

00:06:47.794 --> 00:06:50.344
The Swedes notified their international

00:06:50.344 --> 00:06:52.884
allies that this ship had been taken

00:06:52.884 --> 00:06:56.154
hostage, and it was here that things

00:06:56.164 --> 00:06:58.314
started to ratchet up a notch.

00:06:59.324 --> 00:07:01.754
Given that there were Americans on

00:07:01.754 --> 00:07:04.164
board, the US Defence Department

00:07:04.364 --> 00:07:06.274
soon sprang into action.

00:07:06.904 --> 00:07:09.224
Special forces were dispatched to

00:07:09.224 --> 00:07:11.754
the region, and American allies

00:07:11.874 --> 00:07:14.064
were instructed not to allow

00:07:14.084 --> 00:07:16.244
the ship to dock, so that it

00:07:16.244 --> 00:07:18.504
remained in international waters.

00:07:19.174 --> 00:07:21.154
International waters, of course,

00:07:21.244 --> 00:07:23.234
meaning that the ship wasn’t under

00:07:23.234 --> 00:07:25.724
the jurisdiction of any country, and

00:07:25.944 --> 00:07:28.354
could be stormed by marines without

00:07:28.354 --> 00:07:30.444
it being considered an attack in the

00:07:30.444 --> 00:07:32.444
sovereign territory of another nation.

00:07:33.554 --> 00:07:35.354
The other major international

00:07:35.354 --> 00:07:37.414
player here was Italy.

00:07:38.324 --> 00:07:41.294
The ship was an Italian ship, it

00:07:41.304 --> 00:07:44.644
had set sail from Italy, and most of

00:07:44.644 --> 00:07:46.854
the passengers–and therefore most of

00:07:46.854 --> 00:07:49.524
the hostages–were Italian citizens.

00:07:50.374 --> 00:07:52.864
But Italy was more cautious

00:07:53.204 --> 00:07:55.124
in its response than the US.

00:07:56.114 --> 00:07:59.014
At this point, in the mid-1980s,

00:07:59.504 --> 00:08:01.804
Italy had taken on the role of

00:08:01.804 --> 00:08:04.204
something of a regional power-broker

00:08:04.464 --> 00:08:06.604
in the Mediterranean, and had

00:08:06.604 --> 00:08:08.344
been nurturing its relationship

00:08:08.594 --> 00:08:10.534
with Arab states in the region.

00:08:11.734 --> 00:08:14.204
Nobody had claimed responsibility for the

00:08:14.204 --> 00:08:17.714
hijacking, and the men hadn’t yet issued

00:08:17.714 --> 00:08:20.964
any demands, so the Italians were cautious

00:08:20.984 --> 00:08:23.014
about pointing the finger at anyone.

00:08:23.844 --> 00:08:26.794
Suspicion, however, fell immediately

00:08:27.094 --> 00:08:28.834
on the Palestinian Liberation

00:08:28.834 --> 00:08:31.674
Organisation, the PLO for short.

00:08:32.704 --> 00:08:34.664
The gunmen had been expressing their

00:08:34.664 --> 00:08:37.424
support for Yasser Arafat, the leader

00:08:37.434 --> 00:08:39.814
of the PLO, and the international

00:08:39.814 --> 00:08:43.264
community suspected the PLO was behind it.

00:08:44.384 --> 00:08:47.204
Yasser Arafat, however, denied it.

00:08:47.794 --> 00:08:50.074
And he didn’t just deny it; he

00:08:50.074 --> 00:08:52.274
offered to send assistance in

00:08:52.274 --> 00:08:54.054
putting an end to the incident.

00:08:55.304 --> 00:08:58.234
The following morning, 24 hours after

00:08:58.234 --> 00:09:00.334
the gunmen had stormed the dining

00:09:00.334 --> 00:09:03.054
room, things became a little clearer.

00:09:04.104 --> 00:09:06.164
The men started questioning the

00:09:06.174 --> 00:09:08.604
hostages, asking their nationality

00:09:08.774 --> 00:09:10.574
and taking their passports.

00:09:11.414 --> 00:09:13.114
They were looking for British and

00:09:13.114 --> 00:09:16.084
American citizens, Jews, in particular.

00:09:17.734 --> 00:09:19.344
When they discovered that an

00:09:19.374 --> 00:09:21.514
elderly man was Jewish, they hit

00:09:21.514 --> 00:09:23.414
him over the head with their guns.

00:09:24.804 --> 00:09:27.064
And at 11 o'clock that morning,

00:09:27.344 --> 00:09:29.464
they issued their first demand,

00:09:29.734 --> 00:09:32.074
via a radio broadcast to the Syrian

00:09:32.154 --> 00:09:34.364
authorities, with an instruction for

00:09:34.364 --> 00:09:36.864
the message to be passed on to Israel.

00:09:37.654 --> 00:09:40.804
The men were from the PLF, the

00:09:41.024 --> 00:09:43.744
Palestinian Liberation Front, and

00:09:43.964 --> 00:09:46.734
unless 50 Palestinian prisoners were

00:09:46.734 --> 00:09:49.314
released from Israeli prisons, they

00:09:49.314 --> 00:09:51.444
would start executing the hostages.

00:09:52.624 --> 00:09:56.834
Israel had until 3 pm: five hours.

00:09:57.964 --> 00:10:00.594
Now, as a brief overview of the

00:10:00.594 --> 00:10:02.894
very complicated situation in the

00:10:02.894 --> 00:10:05.284
Middle East at that point, Israel as

00:10:05.284 --> 00:10:08.104
a state was less than 40 years old.

00:10:09.014 --> 00:10:11.974
Since its creation in 1948, the

00:10:11.974 --> 00:10:15.134
region had seen repeated wars, mass

00:10:15.134 --> 00:10:18.604
displacement, and a bitter, unresolved

00:10:18.614 --> 00:10:20.414
struggle between Israel and the

00:10:20.414 --> 00:10:23.064
Palestinians, a struggle that seems,

00:10:23.124 --> 00:10:25.544
unfortunately, no closer to a resolution.

00:10:26.334 --> 00:10:30.234
And by the mid-1980s, this conflict

00:10:30.374 --> 00:10:32.864
was no longer confined to Israel

00:10:33.114 --> 00:10:34.644
and the occupied territories.

00:10:35.404 --> 00:10:38.344
Israel’s 1982 invasion of Lebanon

00:10:38.654 --> 00:10:40.514
had driven Yasser Arafat and the

00:10:40.514 --> 00:10:43.414
PLO out of Beirut, scattering

00:10:43.434 --> 00:10:45.544
Palestinian factions across the region.

00:10:46.344 --> 00:10:48.284
Hundreds of militants were in

00:10:48.284 --> 00:10:51.604
Israeli prisons, and smaller splinter

00:10:51.604 --> 00:10:53.934
groups carried out attacks abroad

00:10:54.144 --> 00:10:56.234
to try to force prisoner releases.

00:10:57.084 --> 00:10:58.954
One of these groups was the

00:10:58.984 --> 00:11:02.627
Palestinian Liberation Front, the PLF.

00:11:03.564 --> 00:11:06.154
It was loyal to a man called Abu

00:11:06.154 --> 00:11:08.904
Abbas, and while it was technically

00:11:08.934 --> 00:11:12.514
linked to the PLO—the main umbrella

00:11:12.514 --> 00:11:15.394
group led by Yasser Arafat—it often

00:11:15.424 --> 00:11:18.044
operated more independently, and

00:11:18.314 --> 00:11:20.824
in this case, it’s believed without

00:11:20.884 --> 00:11:23.084
Arafat’s direct authorisation.

00:11:23.954 --> 00:11:26.854
So, to put it simply, it seemed like

00:11:26.864 --> 00:11:29.054
these men were trying to use the

00:11:29.054 --> 00:11:31.314
Achille Lauro as a bargaining chip.

00:11:32.374 --> 00:11:34.184
They thought that with almost

00:11:34.204 --> 00:11:36.174
a hundred hostages, including

00:11:36.174 --> 00:11:38.064
Americans, the Israelis would

00:11:38.074 --> 00:11:40.394
have no choice but to comply.

00:11:41.414 --> 00:11:43.164
But there was a problem.

00:11:43.974 --> 00:11:46.534
Both Israel and the United States

00:11:46.734 --> 00:11:49.114
had a very strict policy of not

00:11:49.134 --> 00:11:51.374
giving in to terrorist demands.

00:11:52.544 --> 00:11:55.894
And with Syria refusing to let the Achille

00:11:55.904 --> 00:11:59.114
Lauro dock, the ship was left circling

00:11:59.114 --> 00:12:02.704
at sea, stuck in limbo with armed men

00:12:02.904 --> 00:12:04.654
threatening to kill its passengers.

00:12:05.524 --> 00:12:07.874
As the deadline approached, the tension

00:12:07.894 --> 00:12:09.894
on board the ship was unbearable.

00:12:10.594 --> 00:12:13.414
Hostages sat in fear, not knowing

00:12:13.574 --> 00:12:15.084
if they would live or die.

00:12:15.864 --> 00:12:18.604
The hijackers were growing more agitated.

00:12:19.014 --> 00:12:21.624
The hours ticked by with no response.

00:12:22.724 --> 00:12:24.564
As 3 pm approached, the

00:12:24.574 --> 00:12:26.284
gunmen started to move.

00:12:27.344 --> 00:12:30.034
By this point, the hostages had been

00:12:30.034 --> 00:12:32.584
shepherded to an upstairs lounge.

00:12:33.214 --> 00:12:36.104
That is, all but one of the hostages.

00:12:36.794 --> 00:12:39.694
One man, a 69-year-old American

00:12:39.894 --> 00:12:42.004
called Leon Klinghoffer, was

00:12:42.004 --> 00:12:44.784
confined to a wheelchair and had

00:12:44.784 --> 00:12:46.774
no way of making it up the stairs.

00:12:47.844 --> 00:12:50.234
The gunmen, we can certainly use

00:12:50.234 --> 00:12:51.984
the word “terrorists” at this point,

00:12:52.424 --> 00:12:54.227
had decided to let him stay there.

00:12:55.474 --> 00:12:58.434
And shortly before 3 pm, one of the

00:12:58.434 --> 00:13:00.344
terrorists returned to find him.

00:13:01.594 --> 00:13:04.084
He wheeled Klinghoffer to the rear

00:13:04.084 --> 00:13:06.434
deck, out of sight of the other

00:13:06.434 --> 00:13:09.464
hostages, and shot him, once in

00:13:09.464 --> 00:13:11.514
the chest and then in the head.

00:13:12.954 --> 00:13:15.204
He ordered the ship’s staff to

00:13:15.204 --> 00:13:17.924
throw his body into the sea, and

00:13:18.224 --> 00:13:21.034
importantly, not to tell any of the

00:13:21.074 --> 00:13:23.044
other hostages what had happened.

00:13:24.384 --> 00:13:27.614
When his wife, Marilyn, asked what had

00:13:27.614 --> 00:13:29.984
happened to her husband, the terrorists

00:13:30.024 --> 00:13:32.694
told her that he wasn’t feeling well and

00:13:32.914 --> 00:13:35.204
had been taken to the ship’s infirmary.

00:13:35.944 --> 00:13:37.224
Don’t worry, they told

00:13:37.224 --> 00:13:38.574
her, you’ll see him soon.

00:13:39.974 --> 00:13:42.704
The men informed the Syrian authorities

00:13:42.894 --> 00:13:44.254
that they had killed one of the

00:13:44.264 --> 00:13:46.994
hostages and would continue to do

00:13:46.994 --> 00:13:49.114
so until their demands were met.

00:13:49.934 --> 00:13:51.284
Pass on the message to

00:13:51.284 --> 00:13:52.574
the Israelis, they said.

00:13:53.654 --> 00:13:55.794
But the Syrians refused.

00:13:56.774 --> 00:13:58.714
Syria, it seemed, would

00:13:58.724 --> 00:14:00.094
be of no assistance.

00:14:01.394 --> 00:14:02.954
A breakthrough came with the

00:14:02.954 --> 00:14:04.954
help of one of the men offered

00:14:04.974 --> 00:14:06.994
by Yasser Arafat to assist.

00:14:08.064 --> 00:14:10.274
As a reminder, Arafat was the leader

00:14:10.284 --> 00:14:12.994
of the PLO, and the terrorists

00:14:13.174 --> 00:14:15.113
said they were part of the PLF,

00:14:15.454 --> 00:14:17.464
a splinter group of the PLO.

00:14:18.904 --> 00:14:21.274
One of these men, Abu Abbas,

00:14:21.684 --> 00:14:23.804
secretly sent a message to the ship

00:14:24.144 --> 00:14:26.701
using the code-name “Abu Khaled”.

00:14:27.974 --> 00:14:29.994
The message instructed the men to

00:14:30.044 --> 00:14:33.474
treat the hostages kindly and to return

00:14:33.514 --> 00:14:36.224
immediately to Port Said, in Egypt.

00:14:37.094 --> 00:14:38.784
When the hijackers heard this

00:14:38.784 --> 00:14:41.174
message, they reportedly responded

00:14:41.184 --> 00:14:43.714
very positively and immediately

00:14:43.774 --> 00:14:46.344
ordered the ship to turn around and

00:14:46.354 --> 00:14:49.204
head for Port Said, as instructed.

00:14:49.864 --> 00:14:51.524
They hadn’t intended on

00:14:51.534 --> 00:14:53.314
hijacking the ship, they said.

00:14:53.894 --> 00:14:56.564
They had planned to travel to Israel and

00:14:56.564 --> 00:14:59.274
launch an attack there, in retaliation

00:14:59.424 --> 00:15:01.574
for the Israeli attack on the PLO

00:15:01.584 --> 00:15:03.904
headquarters in Tunis a week before.

00:15:04.514 --> 00:15:06.484
But there had been a mistake

00:15:06.484 --> 00:15:08.284
and they’d had to change plans.

00:15:08.804 --> 00:15:10.094
We’ll release the hostages,

00:15:10.274 --> 00:15:11.464
don’t worry, they said.

00:15:12.811 --> 00:15:15.431
Now, the irony here is that the man

00:15:15.431 --> 00:15:17.581
who sent this message to the hijackers,

00:15:18.071 --> 00:15:21.721
“Abu Khaled”, was Abu Abbas, the man

00:15:21.751 --> 00:15:24.401
supposedly negotiating with the gunmen,

00:15:24.651 --> 00:15:27.251
alongside the Egyptians and the Italians.

00:15:27.971 --> 00:15:30.621
He was not some well-intentioned

00:15:30.901 --> 00:15:31.921
peace negotiator.

00:15:32.501 --> 00:15:35.351
He was the leader of the PLF and

00:15:35.351 --> 00:15:37.791
the very man who had planned and

00:15:37.881 --> 00:15:39.841
orchestrated the entire mission.

00:15:40.591 --> 00:15:42.441
He was the terrorists’ boss,

00:15:42.831 --> 00:15:44.641
not some kindly diplomat.

00:15:46.171 --> 00:15:49.101
When the Americans joined the dots, and

00:15:49.218 --> 00:15:52.251
realised his role in the mission, this

00:15:52.311 --> 00:15:55.061
created a delicate situation indeed.

00:15:56.201 --> 00:15:59.501
He was a PLO loyalist, and much of the

00:15:59.511 --> 00:16:01.921
international community, including the

00:16:01.921 --> 00:16:04.231
United States and Italy, had been trying

00:16:04.231 --> 00:16:06.681
to foster closer relations with the

00:16:06.681 --> 00:16:10.231
PLO, as its primary link to Palestine.

00:16:11.131 --> 00:16:15.221
But this PLO loyalist had been outed as

00:16:15.221 --> 00:16:17.631
someone who the terrorists recognised

00:16:17.641 --> 00:16:20.041
by name, someone it looked highly

00:16:20.041 --> 00:16:23.131
likely had organised the entire mission.

00:16:24.341 --> 00:16:27.291
Still, if the PLO were accused,

00:16:27.581 --> 00:16:29.241
there was the risk of the situation

00:16:29.251 --> 00:16:32.531
blowing up, and Abbas seemed like

00:16:32.531 --> 00:16:34.821
the best person to defuse it.

00:16:35.721 --> 00:16:38.601
The ship neared Port Said, entering

00:16:38.601 --> 00:16:40.361
Egyptian territorial waters

00:16:40.571 --> 00:16:42.841
and making any kind of American

00:16:42.891 --> 00:16:44.761
military intervention impossible.

00:16:46.041 --> 00:16:48.441
The captain radioed in to the Egyptian

00:16:48.441 --> 00:16:51.331
authorities and told them that everyone

00:16:51.351 --> 00:16:54.471
on board was safe and unharmed.

00:16:55.521 --> 00:16:57.971
The terrorists would release the hostages

00:16:58.281 --> 00:17:00.181
on the condition that they would be

00:17:00.181 --> 00:17:02.871
granted safe passage out of Egypt.

00:17:03.991 --> 00:17:07.461
It seemed like diplomacy had prevailed.

00:17:08.091 --> 00:17:09.611
The Italian foreign minister

00:17:09.961 --> 00:17:12.921
proudly boasted of Italy’s role as

00:17:12.921 --> 00:17:16.341
a mediator in the crisis, defusing

00:17:16.341 --> 00:17:18.351
an extremely delicate situation

00:17:18.651 --> 00:17:21.031
without a drop of blood being spilled.

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:25.250
In the afternoon of October 9th, the

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:27.647
Achille Lauro arrived back in Port

00:17:27.647 --> 00:17:30.690
Said and the hijacking formally ended.

00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:34.410
The gunmen released the hostages, and to

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:37.200
the relief of the Italian and American

00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:40.350
authorities, the passengers walked free.

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:43.510
As you know, though, not

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:45.350
every passenger walked free.

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:48.910
The captain had told the authorities

00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:50.850
that everyone was safe and well,

00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:53.950
but he knew that Klinghoffer had

00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:55.570
been murdered by the terrorists.

00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:58.110
He had only lied because one of the

00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:00.980
terrorists was pointing a gun to his head.

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:03.850
And when he told the Italian

00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:05.960
authorities later that day about

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:08.420
Klinghoffer, this added a whole

00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:10.620
new dimension to the situation.

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:14.270
The Egyptians, with the help of the

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.350
Italian authorities, had allowed

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:19.290
four murderers to get off scot-free,

00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:21.560
and it looked like they were going

00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:23.530
to help them flee the country.

00:18:24.787 --> 00:18:25.957
And, what’s more, the

00:18:25.957 --> 00:18:27.977
murdered man was American.

00:18:28.877 --> 00:18:31.187
The Americans were furious, and

00:18:31.227 --> 00:18:33.317
demanded the Egyptian authorities

00:18:33.397 --> 00:18:36.067
prosecute the men, or to quote the

00:18:36.067 --> 00:18:38.497
American ambassador, “we insist that

00:18:38.497 --> 00:18:40.587
they prosecute those sons of bitches”.

00:18:41.867 --> 00:18:45.107
But at this time the terrorists, now

00:18:45.327 --> 00:18:47.977
outed as murderers, were about to board a

00:18:48.007 --> 00:18:50.787
commercial flight out of the country, to

00:18:51.137 --> 00:18:53.707
Tunis, where the PLF was headquartered.

00:18:54.397 --> 00:18:57.167
So, to take stock, we have these

00:18:57.177 --> 00:18:59.417
four men getting on this plane,

00:18:59.747 --> 00:19:02.087
assisted by the Egyptian authorities.

00:19:03.167 --> 00:19:06.237
In fact it’s not just the four men at

00:19:06.237 --> 00:19:09.097
this point; it includes Abu Abbas, by

00:19:09.097 --> 00:19:11.127
now clearly the leader of the mission,

00:19:11.578 --> 00:19:13.747
but the man who was pretending to

00:19:13.747 --> 00:19:15.577
be working with the Egyptians and

00:19:15.577 --> 00:19:17.867
Italians to defuse the situation.

00:19:18.767 --> 00:19:20.477
It’s now clear that a man

00:19:20.487 --> 00:19:22.067
was murdered on the boat.

00:19:22.547 --> 00:19:25.707
The Americans are furious, and the

00:19:25.707 --> 00:19:28.157
Italians are sort of stuck in the middle.

00:19:29.607 --> 00:19:32.097
A plan is hatched to intercept

00:19:32.127 --> 00:19:34.207
the plane on its way to Tunis.

00:19:35.277 --> 00:19:36.827
The Americans thought this would be

00:19:36.827 --> 00:19:39.547
possible because Egypt had pretty

00:19:39.587 --> 00:19:41.827
poor relations with Libya at this

00:19:41.827 --> 00:19:43.867
point, so the plane would have to

00:19:43.877 --> 00:19:45.907
go through international airspace.

00:19:47.017 --> 00:19:49.337
And sure enough, as the EgyptAir

00:19:49.337 --> 00:19:51.877
plane crossed the Mediterranean, four

00:19:52.037 --> 00:19:55.627
US Navy F-14 fighter jets pulled up

00:19:55.687 --> 00:19:58.347
alongside it, and instructed it to

00:19:58.347 --> 00:20:01.457
follow them to a NATO base in Sicily.

00:20:02.767 --> 00:20:05.227
The pilot tried to radio in to

00:20:05.227 --> 00:20:07.407
the Egyptian authorities, but the

00:20:07.407 --> 00:20:09.997
Americans had scrambled the airwaves,

00:20:10.127 --> 00:20:12.197
making communication impossible.

00:20:13.367 --> 00:20:15.647
Being tailed by American fighter jets,

00:20:15.867 --> 00:20:18.617
the pilot had little choice but to agree.

00:20:19.727 --> 00:20:21.487
It was forced to land at the

00:20:21.487 --> 00:20:23.847
NATO base at Sigonella, on

00:20:23.847 --> 00:20:25.397
the Italian island of Sicily.

00:20:26.217 --> 00:20:27.997
And this is where the story

00:20:28.177 --> 00:20:30.077
took an extraordinary twist.

00:20:30.927 --> 00:20:33.417
The Americans expected to take

00:20:33.447 --> 00:20:35.637
custody of the hijackers immediately.

00:20:36.177 --> 00:20:37.497
It was an American mission,

00:20:37.887 --> 00:20:40.157
a NATO airbase, and these men

00:20:40.347 --> 00:20:42.277
had killed an American citizen.

00:20:42.627 --> 00:20:45.404
It was an American problem to resolve.

00:20:46.514 --> 00:20:48.384
But the Italians refused.

00:20:48.814 --> 00:20:51.784
The Achille Lauro was an Italian ship; the

00:20:51.784 --> 00:20:54.524
passengers were mostly Italian citizens,

00:20:54.794 --> 00:20:57.584
and the crime, the Italians argued, had

00:20:57.584 --> 00:21:00.034
been committed under their jurisdiction.

00:21:01.344 --> 00:21:03.634
Tensions escalated rapidly.

00:21:04.604 --> 00:21:07.294
At one point, American and Italian

00:21:07.294 --> 00:21:09.534
soldiers faced each other on the

00:21:09.534 --> 00:21:11.854
runway at Sigonella, the Sicilian

00:21:11.854 --> 00:21:14.444
base, weapons loaded, in a

00:21:14.464 --> 00:21:17.324
standoff between two NATO allies.

00:21:18.624 --> 00:21:21.484
Eventually, after tense negotiations,

00:21:21.624 --> 00:21:24.104
and Italian promises that the men would

00:21:24.134 --> 00:21:26.714
be prosecuted, common sense prevailed.

00:21:28.114 --> 00:21:30.514
The Italian authorities took custody

00:21:30.514 --> 00:21:32.954
of the hijackers, arrested them, and

00:21:32.954 --> 00:21:34.834
later put them on trial in Italy.

00:21:36.194 --> 00:21:39.264
Abu Abbas, however, slipped away.

00:21:40.064 --> 00:21:42.564
Despite being the mastermind, he was

00:21:42.564 --> 00:21:45.054
allowed to leave Italy a free man,

00:21:45.444 --> 00:21:47.614
supposedly because there wasn’t enough

00:21:47.664 --> 00:21:50.124
evidence to prosecute him at that point.

00:21:51.274 --> 00:21:52.964
He flew on to Yugoslavia,

00:21:53.324 --> 00:21:54.904
then to the Middle East, and

00:21:55.064 --> 00:21:57.084
for years remained at large.

00:21:58.474 --> 00:21:59.714
The four gunmen, though,

00:21:59.984 --> 00:22:01.604
would not escape justice.

00:22:02.344 --> 00:22:04.744
In 1986, they were tried and

00:22:04.744 --> 00:22:06.904
convicted in an Italian court.

00:22:07.784 --> 00:22:10.014
One received a 30-year sentence,

00:22:10.264 --> 00:22:12.304
two received life sentences, and the

00:22:12.304 --> 00:22:14.394
fourth, who had cooperated with the

00:22:14.394 --> 00:22:16.824
investigators, received a shorter term.

00:22:17.964 --> 00:22:19.984
And as for the Achille Lauro

00:22:20.024 --> 00:22:22.394
herself, it was not all “plain

00:22:22.394 --> 00:22:24.334
sailing”, as the expression goes.

00:22:25.254 --> 00:22:27.894
In 1994, while sailing off the

00:22:27.894 --> 00:22:30.014
coast of Somalia, en route to

00:22:30.014 --> 00:22:32.604
South Africa, and with almost 900

00:22:32.654 --> 00:22:35.054
passengers on board, she caught fire.

00:22:36.014 --> 00:22:38.064
The crew tried to fight the fire,

00:22:38.254 --> 00:22:40.364
but it spread uncontrollably.

00:22:41.314 --> 00:22:42.364
The morning afterwards,

00:22:42.614 --> 00:22:44.014
the ship was evacuated.

00:22:44.674 --> 00:22:46.454
Two passengers died in the process.

00:22:46.974 --> 00:22:48.704
As the rest were ushered away in

00:22:48.704 --> 00:22:50.974
lifeboats, they watched as the

00:22:50.974 --> 00:22:53.314
Achille Lauro burned and slowly

00:22:53.314 --> 00:22:55.814
slipped between the waves, lost

00:22:55.824 --> 00:22:57.674
forever in the Arabian Sea.

00:22:59.034 --> 00:23:01.584
And as for its legacy, it had

00:23:01.614 --> 00:23:04.264
consequences far beyond the tragedy

00:23:04.414 --> 00:23:06.334
of Leon Klinghoffer’s death and

00:23:06.334 --> 00:23:07.954
the courtroom trials of the gunmen.

00:23:08.924 --> 00:23:11.344
It shocked public opinion, hardened

00:23:11.364 --> 00:23:13.424
attitudes against negotiating with

00:23:13.444 --> 00:23:16.384
terrorists, and pushed governments to act.

00:23:17.554 --> 00:23:19.534
Shortly afterwards, the world’s

00:23:19.544 --> 00:23:22.224
major powers had agreed the SUA

00:23:22.224 --> 00:23:24.614
Convention, a treaty that made ship

00:23:24.664 --> 00:23:26.894
hijacking an international crime.

00:23:28.127 --> 00:23:30.217
It was also seriously damaging

00:23:30.467 --> 00:23:32.737
in Italo-American relations.

00:23:33.367 --> 00:23:35.957
Italy’s decision to let Abu Abbas walk

00:23:35.957 --> 00:23:39.967
free left Washington furious and exposed

00:23:39.977 --> 00:23:42.167
deep cracks in the NATO alliance.

00:23:43.567 --> 00:23:46.427
And for Palestinians, the image of

00:23:46.427 --> 00:23:49.077
a murdered, wheelchair-bound tourist

00:23:49.087 --> 00:23:51.974
was catastrophic, undermining Yasser

00:23:51.974 --> 00:23:54.204
Arafat’s efforts to present the PLO

00:23:54.387 --> 00:23:56.747
as a credible diplomatic partner.

00:23:58.037 --> 00:24:01.407
So, as a final thought, the Achille

00:24:01.407 --> 00:24:03.657
Lauro may now lay on the seabed,

00:24:03.677 --> 00:24:07.047
rusting away, but its name remains tied

00:24:07.107 --> 00:24:09.277
to one of the most infamous acts of

00:24:09.277 --> 00:24:12.497
terrorism of the 1980s, one in which

00:24:12.507 --> 00:24:15.711
only one person died, but that serves

00:24:15.711 --> 00:24:18.661
as a reminder of how a single act could

00:24:18.661 --> 00:24:21.031
shake governments, strain alliances,

00:24:21.191 --> 00:24:23.391
and even change international law.

00:24:24.711 --> 00:24:26.571
OK, then, that is it for today's

00:24:26.571 --> 00:24:28.561
episode on the Achille Lauro.

00:24:28.951 --> 00:24:30.291
I hope it's been an interesting one

00:24:30.591 --> 00:24:32.411
and that you've learnt something new.

00:24:32.911 --> 00:24:34.631
As always, I would love to hear

00:24:34.631 --> 00:24:36.131
your thoughts on this episode.

00:24:36.511 --> 00:24:38.991
Do you remember the Achille Lauro crisis?

00:24:39.421 --> 00:24:40.691
How could it have been handled

00:24:40.691 --> 00:24:42.981
differently, and what do you think some of

00:24:42.981 --> 00:24:45.311
the long-lasting consequences have been?

00:24:46.011 --> 00:24:47.941
I would love to know, and the place

00:24:47.941 --> 00:24:50.101
for that is our community forum, which

00:24:50.111 --> 00:24:52.631
is at community.leonardoenglish.com.

00:24:53.481 --> 00:24:55.261
You've been listening to English Learning

for Curious Minds by Leonardo English.

00:24:58.381 --> 00:25:01.031
I'm Alastair Budge, you stay safe, and

00:25:01.031 --> 00:25:03.291
I'll catch you in the next episode.
