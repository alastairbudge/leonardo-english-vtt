Hello, hello, hello, and welcome

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.940
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.690
Minds, by Leonardo English, the show

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.680
where you can listen to fascinating

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.039
stories and learn weird and wonderful

00:00:17.049 --> 00:00:18.939
things about the world at the same

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:20.650
time as improving your English.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.020
I'm Alastair Budge, and today it’s the

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.080
start of a new year, and also the start

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.930
of a new three-part mini-series, all

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.220
on the theme of “words and language”.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.209
In part one, today’s episode, we are

00:00:36.209 --> 00:00:38.060
going to talk about “Words Of The

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.639
Year” - the words chosen each year

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.970
by dictionaries for their particular

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:44.949
cultural importance that year.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.600
In part two, we are going to talk about

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.419
the concept of euphemisms in English

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:53.739
- when you describe something unpleasant

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.570
or uncomfortable in a more friendly way.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.950
And in part three, we are going to

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.610
talk about the word “enshittification”.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.009
It was coined in 2022, but we’ll

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:08.240
look at what it means, how it has

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.809
evolved since then, and what it

00:01:10.809 --> 00:01:13.080
tells us about the world we live in.

00:01:13.802 --> 00:01:16.452
Ok then, let’s get right into it

00:01:16.752 --> 00:01:19.512
and talk about words of the year.

00:01:20.852 --> 00:01:23.172
One of the great, but also

00:01:23.172 --> 00:01:25.552
frustrating things, about language

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:28.702
is that it is constantly evolving.

00:01:29.342 --> 00:01:31.322
Words change their meaning.

00:01:31.782 --> 00:01:32.882
Spellings change.

00:01:33.182 --> 00:01:34.082
Grammar changes.

00:01:34.602 --> 00:01:36.572
Words stop being used.

00:01:36.992 --> 00:01:40.642
And entirely new words are introduced.

00:01:41.342 --> 00:01:43.632
And the more people that speak

00:01:43.842 --> 00:01:46.472
a language, and the greater the

00:01:46.482 --> 00:01:48.012
variety of people who speak that

00:01:48.012 --> 00:01:50.472
language, the more this is the case.

00:01:51.882 --> 00:01:54.722
English, with its hundreds of millions

00:01:54.742 --> 00:01:57.122
of native speakers and billions more

00:01:57.392 --> 00:01:59.912
non-native speakers, spread over

00:02:00.032 --> 00:02:02.262
practically every country in the world,

00:02:02.792 --> 00:02:05.982
is in a constant state of evolution.

00:02:07.212 --> 00:02:09.782
One of the ways in which lexicographers

00:02:10.102 --> 00:02:12.872
try to document this evolution of

00:02:12.872 --> 00:02:16.372
language is by choosing a “word of the

00:02:16.372 --> 00:02:18.872
year”, a word or expression in English

00:02:19.232 --> 00:02:21.722
that has been of particular cultural

00:02:21.872 --> 00:02:24.502
significance that year. It doesn’t

00:02:24.512 --> 00:02:27.262
have to be a completely new word,

00:02:27.542 --> 00:02:30.742
although often it is, but it has to be

00:02:30.742 --> 00:02:33.592
a word or expression that entered the

00:02:33.592 --> 00:02:35.872
language in a way it never had before.

00:02:36.782 --> 00:02:39.452
Now, I should start by saying that

00:02:39.462 --> 00:02:42.182
defining a “Word of the Year” isn’t

00:02:42.382 --> 00:02:45.052
actually an English-language invention;

00:02:45.412 --> 00:02:48.922
it was “inspired” by the German tradition

00:02:48.982 --> 00:02:52.132
of Wort des Jahres, “Word of the Year”

00:02:52.362 --> 00:02:55.247
in German, which started in 1971.

00:02:56.004 --> 00:02:58.942
It’s now a tradition followed by most

00:02:59.192 --> 00:03:01.492
major English-language dictionaries,

00:03:01.682 --> 00:03:03.752
including the Cambridge and Oxford

00:03:03.762 --> 00:03:05.462
Dictionaries, Merriam-Webster,

00:03:05.462 --> 00:03:08.202
Dictionary.com, as well as the American

00:03:08.212 --> 00:03:10.662
Dialect Society and the Australian

00:03:10.662 --> 00:03:12.892
National Dictionary Centre, which

00:03:13.102 --> 00:03:15.002
reflect language used in American

00:03:15.292 --> 00:03:17.422
and Australian English, respectively.

00:03:18.242 --> 00:03:21.072
So, what we are going to do today

00:03:21.482 --> 00:03:23.242
is talk about this tradition.

00:03:24.032 --> 00:03:26.762
We’ll start by talking about how it

00:03:26.762 --> 00:03:31.122
works and the process of how a word ends

00:03:31.122 --> 00:03:33.012
up being chosen as “Word of the Year”.

00:03:33.692 --> 00:03:35.332
Then we’ll talk about some of

00:03:35.352 --> 00:03:37.592
the particularly interesting ones

00:03:37.862 --> 00:03:39.682
from the past 20 years or so,

00:03:40.222 --> 00:03:41.902
and we’ll end by talking about

00:03:41.912 --> 00:03:45.992
the words of the year for 2025.

00:03:46.892 --> 00:03:48.242
Let’s start with the basics.

00:03:48.702 --> 00:03:50.982
How do dictionaries actually

00:03:50.992 --> 00:03:52.362
choose a word of the year?

00:03:53.372 --> 00:03:55.122
Well, it all depends

00:03:55.122 --> 00:03:57.132
slightly on who you ask.

00:03:57.792 --> 00:04:00.802
But broadly speaking, it’s a combination

00:04:00.832 --> 00:04:04.122
of data and editorial judgement.

00:04:05.232 --> 00:04:07.512
Most major dictionaries now

00:04:07.512 --> 00:04:10.282
analyse enormous databases of

00:04:10.422 --> 00:04:12.682
written and spoken English.

00:04:13.412 --> 00:04:16.402
This used to be primarily from things

00:04:16.402 --> 00:04:19.962
like newspapers, books, the radio and TV,

00:04:20.252 --> 00:04:23.512
but it’s expanded to include everywhere

00:04:23.512 --> 00:04:26.012
that language is recorded: social media,

00:04:26.402 --> 00:04:29.262
YouTube videos, podcasts, and so on.

00:04:30.482 --> 00:04:34.582
By analysing this data, lexicographers

00:04:34.912 --> 00:04:37.832
can identify which words are being

00:04:37.842 --> 00:04:40.522
used more than usual, which words have

00:04:40.522 --> 00:04:44.144
appeared out of nowhere, and which words

00:04:44.222 --> 00:04:46.322
have suddenly taken on new meanings.

00:04:46.822 --> 00:04:49.042
So that’s the data side.

00:04:49.706 --> 00:04:52.652
But it’s not just a question of numbers.

00:04:53.112 --> 00:04:55.902
It also involves people sitting down

00:04:56.142 --> 00:04:57.862
and thinking carefully about what a

00:04:57.862 --> 00:05:01.092
particular word tells us about that year.

00:05:01.852 --> 00:05:05.572
Not just how often it was used, but why.

00:05:06.562 --> 00:05:08.982
What does it reveal about how

00:05:08.982 --> 00:05:10.672
people were feeling, what they were

00:05:10.722 --> 00:05:13.462
talking about, and what mattered

00:05:13.462 --> 00:05:15.382
most in that particular moment?

00:05:16.202 --> 00:05:18.332
That’s the editorial side.

00:05:18.732 --> 00:05:20.812
And some dictionaries

00:05:21.062 --> 00:05:23.272
even add a third element.

00:05:23.992 --> 00:05:27.272
They release a shortlist, but put

00:05:27.322 --> 00:05:30.052
it to a public vote, letting members

00:05:30.052 --> 00:05:32.362
of the general population decide

00:05:32.372 --> 00:05:34.442
what the word of the year should be.

00:05:35.652 --> 00:05:38.152
And while each dictionary might

00:05:38.162 --> 00:05:40.672
have its own criteria, there

00:05:40.672 --> 00:05:42.862
are usually a few common themes.

00:05:43.392 --> 00:05:45.222
Words that reflect politics,

00:05:45.282 --> 00:05:47.902
culture, technology, social

00:05:47.902 --> 00:05:50.262
movements, and, more recently, the

00:05:50.282 --> 00:05:52.622
internet and how we talk online.

00:05:53.332 --> 00:05:57.172
So now that we’ve covered the basics of

00:05:57.202 --> 00:06:00.142
how the word of the year is chosen, let’s

00:06:00.152 --> 00:06:03.142
take a look at some actual examples.

00:06:03.912 --> 00:06:06.042
We won’t go through every year, but

00:06:06.442 --> 00:06:08.782
I want to share a few highlights

00:06:08.932 --> 00:06:11.152
from the past couple of decades.

00:06:11.412 --> 00:06:14.632
Some are funny, some are serious, some

00:06:14.632 --> 00:06:17.422
are quite surprising, and others you might

00:06:17.462 --> 00:06:20.142
already use in your everyday English.

00:06:21.132 --> 00:06:25.162
Let’s start by going back to 2005.

00:06:26.042 --> 00:06:28.522
That year, the American Dialect

00:06:28.562 --> 00:06:32.052
Society chose the word “truthiness”.

00:06:33.022 --> 00:06:35.902
Now, although you might look at that

00:06:35.902 --> 00:06:39.406
word or hear that word and think, “I

00:06:39.406 --> 00:06:42.562
haven’t seen that before, but ok, it has

00:06:42.732 --> 00:06:46.712
'truth' in it, and 'iness' probably means

00:06:47.062 --> 00:06:49.972
the quality of whatever the adjective

00:06:49.972 --> 00:06:52.582
or noun was, in this case 'truth’.

00:06:53.122 --> 00:06:56.772
So maybe ‘truthiness’ means something

00:06:56.792 --> 00:06:58.992
like 'the quality of being true’”.

00:07:00.722 --> 00:07:03.012
That would be a perfectly good guess,

00:07:03.122 --> 00:07:06.392
perfectly reasonable, but it isn’t right.

00:07:07.362 --> 00:07:10.972
“Truthiness” was a term popularised by

00:07:10.972 --> 00:07:13.739
the American comedian Stephen Colbert

00:07:14.132 --> 00:07:16.702
to mean something that feels like

00:07:16.702 --> 00:07:19.792
it should be true, even if it isn’t.

00:07:21.252 --> 00:07:23.702
It was a new word for an old

00:07:23.702 --> 00:07:26.992
idea: the idea that people often

00:07:26.992 --> 00:07:29.112
believe what they want to be

00:07:29.122 --> 00:07:32.182
true, not what is actually true.

00:07:33.452 --> 00:07:36.832
With Colbert, he used it to criticise

00:07:36.942 --> 00:07:39.622
politicians and media figures who weren’t

00:07:39.632 --> 00:07:43.192
so interested in the facts, just in what

00:07:43.202 --> 00:07:46.292
sounded good and felt like it was true.

00:07:47.022 --> 00:07:49.552
In particular, it was aimed at President

00:07:49.562 --> 00:07:52.632
George W. Bush and his famously strong

00:07:52.892 --> 00:07:55.542
convictions, like the existence of Saddam

00:07:55.542 --> 00:07:57.122
Hussein’s weapons of mass destruction,

00:07:57.732 --> 00:07:59.852
even if there wasn’t any evidence.

00:08:00.702 --> 00:08:01.592
A nice word, right?

00:08:03.012 --> 00:08:08.022
Jumping ahead to 2013, Oxford Dictionaries

00:08:08.202 --> 00:08:11.402
chose “selfie” as its word of the year.

00:08:12.402 --> 00:08:14.752
As you no doubt know, a “selfie”

00:08:15.022 --> 00:08:17.092
is the word for a photo you take of

00:08:17.092 --> 00:08:19.302
yourself, typically with your phone.

00:08:20.342 --> 00:08:23.042
And although it probably seems completely

00:08:23.392 --> 00:08:25.722
unbelievable to anyone under the age

00:08:25.722 --> 00:08:29.422
of 18, anyone who lived before the

00:08:29.452 --> 00:08:31.342
iPhone and Instagram will know that

00:08:31.342 --> 00:08:33.392
this wasn’t something that people

00:08:33.422 --> 00:08:35.792
always did, so there wasn’t really

00:08:35.792 --> 00:08:38.402
a need for a word to describe it.

00:08:39.322 --> 00:08:40.792
It’s interesting to mention this

00:08:41.112 --> 00:08:42.842
because the inclusion of this

00:08:42.842 --> 00:08:45.652
word as “word of the year” clearly

00:08:45.702 --> 00:08:47.782
pinpoints this cultural shift.

00:08:48.382 --> 00:08:51.282
And if a historian in 100 years

00:08:51.542 --> 00:08:53.792
needs to figure out the exact date

00:08:54.172 --> 00:08:56.192
when humans started taking pictures

00:08:56.202 --> 00:08:59.102
of themselves en masse, well, the

00:08:59.102 --> 00:09:01.392
choice of ‘selfie’ as Word Of The

00:09:01.392 --> 00:09:03.562
Year provides a pretty good clue.

00:09:04.602 --> 00:09:06.102
And we can go on.

00:09:06.532 --> 00:09:09.232
In 2016, ‘post-truth’

00:09:09.462 --> 00:09:10.512
was the word of the year.

00:09:11.422 --> 00:09:13.402
This referred to a time when

00:09:13.502 --> 00:09:16.422
objective facts seemed to matter less

00:09:16.422 --> 00:09:19.172
than emotions or personal beliefs.

00:09:19.412 --> 00:09:21.522
It was the year of Brexit, the

00:09:21.722 --> 00:09:23.892
US presidential election, and

00:09:23.902 --> 00:09:26.342
intense political polarisation.

00:09:27.402 --> 00:09:29.392
It’s a pretty depressing word,

00:09:29.392 --> 00:09:31.702
but one that definitely captured

00:09:31.932 --> 00:09:33.142
the feeling of the time.

00:09:34.062 --> 00:09:37.922
In 2022, Oxford let the public vote

00:09:38.142 --> 00:09:39.752
on the word of the year, and the

00:09:39.752 --> 00:09:43.042
winner was “goblin mode”. A goblin,

00:09:43.472 --> 00:09:45.482
if you don’t know this word, is a

00:09:45.482 --> 00:09:49.702
sort of imaginary, naughty, often ugly

00:09:49.702 --> 00:09:52.022
creature that plays tricks on humans.

00:09:52.802 --> 00:09:55.932
And “goblin mode” describes

00:09:56.002 --> 00:09:59.282
a kind of lazy, messy, and

00:09:59.642 --> 00:10:02.666
unapologetically unbothered attitude.

00:10:03.152 --> 00:10:05.952
Someone in goblin mode might be

00:10:06.322 --> 00:10:08.862
eating junk food in bed and ignoring

00:10:08.882 --> 00:10:11.242
all responsibilities, simply not

00:10:11.242 --> 00:10:13.582
caring about what anyone else thinks.

00:10:14.332 --> 00:10:17.912
It’s not a polite word necessarily, but it

00:10:17.912 --> 00:10:20.382
clearly resonated with a lot of people who

00:10:20.382 --> 00:10:23.572
were feeling burnt out or just done with

00:10:23.572 --> 00:10:25.672
pretending to be productive all the time.

00:10:26.702 --> 00:10:29.062
And that brings us to the present.

00:10:30.402 --> 00:10:32.312
In a moment, we'll look at the words

00:10:32.422 --> 00:10:36.752
that were chosen in 2025, but before we

00:10:36.752 --> 00:10:40.112
do, I want to just have a quick pause to

00:10:40.452 --> 00:10:43.142
ask what all these words have in common.

00:10:43.912 --> 00:10:46.382
They aren’t just words really.

00:10:46.382 --> 00:10:47.762
They are signs.

00:10:47.902 --> 00:10:50.242
They reflect what people are thinking

00:10:50.242 --> 00:10:52.602
about, what people are worried about, what

00:10:52.642 --> 00:10:55.942
they’re joking about, and how language

00:10:56.002 --> 00:10:59.842
adapts to express new ideas or feelings.

00:11:00.582 --> 00:11:02.912
So with that in mind, let’s

00:11:02.912 --> 00:11:06.116
turn our attention to 2025.

00:11:06.612 --> 00:11:09.192
What were the words of the year this time?

00:11:09.552 --> 00:11:11.112
And what do they tell us about

00:11:11.112 --> 00:11:12.582
the moment we are living in?

00:11:13.922 --> 00:11:16.682
One of them is a bit surprising.

00:11:17.082 --> 00:11:18.639
It’s not even a real word

00:11:18.932 --> 00:11:20.212
in the traditional sense.

00:11:20.532 --> 00:11:22.332
It’s 6 7.

00:11:22.892 --> 00:11:25.012
Yes, the numbers six seven.

00:11:25.802 --> 00:11:28.032
That was chosen by Dictionary.com

00:11:28.332 --> 00:11:31.272
as its word of the year for 2025.

00:11:32.472 --> 00:11:35.812
If you’ve heard of this word before, it’s

00:11:35.822 --> 00:11:37.602
probably because you have young kids,

00:11:37.962 --> 00:11:40.672
and if you haven’t heard of it before and

00:11:40.672 --> 00:11:42.892
you’re wondering what it means, the honest

00:11:42.892 --> 00:11:45.892
answer is… nobody really seems to know.

00:11:46.559 --> 00:11:49.832
I have a six-year-old son, and one of his

00:11:49.842 --> 00:11:52.252
friends came over to play the other day.

00:11:52.862 --> 00:11:54.952
I asked him–in Swedish, because

00:11:54.952 --> 00:11:57.002
we live in Sweden–how are you,

00:11:57.502 --> 00:12:00.392
and he responded “six seven”, the

00:12:00.412 --> 00:12:02.452
English expression “six seven”.

00:12:03.432 --> 00:12:06.262
His mum shrugged and said she

00:12:06.262 --> 00:12:07.482
didn’t really know why he said

00:12:07.482 --> 00:12:09.902
this, and it seems like there is no

00:12:10.122 --> 00:12:12.112
definite answer to what it means.

00:12:12.962 --> 00:12:16.992
According to Dictionary.com, 6 7 became

00:12:16.992 --> 00:12:19.192
popular on TikTok and other social

00:12:19.192 --> 00:12:23.192
media platforms in 2024 and 2025.

00:12:23.872 --> 00:12:27.302
It started off as an in-joke, then

00:12:27.302 --> 00:12:30.402
a trend, then a meme, and somehow

00:12:30.702 --> 00:12:32.632
ended up becoming a phrase that means

00:12:33.082 --> 00:12:35.332
everything and nothing at the same time.

00:12:36.102 --> 00:12:38.572
Young people have used it in videos,

00:12:39.032 --> 00:12:42.112
comments, as a gesture, as a sort of

00:12:42.412 --> 00:12:44.732
catch-all response to almost anything.

00:12:45.392 --> 00:12:48.012
If someone asks a question and you don’t

00:12:48.042 --> 00:12:49.922
really want to answer, you can just say

00:12:50.192 --> 00:12:52.992
“six seven”. If you’re joking around with

00:12:52.992 --> 00:12:55.552
a friend and want to tease them, just say

00:12:55.552 --> 00:12:57.542
“six seven”. It means whatever you want

00:12:57.542 --> 00:12:59.712
it to mean, and that’s kind of the point.

00:13:00.672 --> 00:13:03.222
The team at Dictionary.com described

00:13:03.222 --> 00:13:06.242
it as “a playful, Gen Alpha expression

00:13:06.262 --> 00:13:09.152
of absurdist internet humour”. It’s

00:13:09.182 --> 00:13:11.622
chaotic, slightly annoying, kind of

00:13:11.632 --> 00:13:14.042
meaningless, and oddly fascinating.

00:13:14.612 --> 00:13:16.962
And importantly, if you are old enough to

00:13:16.962 --> 00:13:19.552
vote, you’re probably too old to use it.

00:13:20.072 --> 00:13:22.832
So “6 7” was one of the words that

00:13:22.842 --> 00:13:25.162
was chosen. The Collins Dictionary,

00:13:25.462 --> 00:13:27.342
interestingly enough, didn’t

00:13:27.352 --> 00:13:29.572
even include it in its shortlist.

00:13:30.182 --> 00:13:32.302
There were 10 words shortlisted

00:13:32.452 --> 00:13:33.872
for its potential word of the

00:13:33.872 --> 00:13:36.992
year: ‘aura farming’, ‘biohacking’,

00:13:37.142 --> 00:13:40.459
‘broligarchy’, ‘clanker’, ‘coolcation’,

00:13:40.459 --> 00:13:43.572
‘glaze’, ‘HENRY’, ‘microretirement’,

00:13:43.742 --> 00:13:46.352
‘taskmasking’, and ‘vibe coding’.

00:13:46.982 --> 00:13:48.312
We can actually go through

00:13:48.312 --> 00:13:49.932
them one by one, quickly.

00:13:50.672 --> 00:13:53.062
Aura farming is when people post

00:13:53.222 --> 00:13:55.822
highly edited or curated photos

00:13:55.852 --> 00:13:57.752
online to boost their image.

00:13:58.412 --> 00:14:00.912
Biohacking is the idea of using

00:14:00.922 --> 00:14:03.692
science or self-experimentation to

00:14:03.692 --> 00:14:06.282
try to improve your body or mind.

00:14:06.722 --> 00:14:09.072
Broligarchy describes a group of

00:14:09.142 --> 00:14:11.162
powerful men who are all close

00:14:11.162 --> 00:14:14.142
friends, a kind of brotherly oligarchy.

00:14:15.002 --> 00:14:17.032
Clanker is a derogatory

00:14:17.032 --> 00:14:18.849
term used for a computer.

00:14:19.149 --> 00:14:22.162
Coolcation is a holiday somewhere cool.

00:14:22.572 --> 00:14:24.052
Not cool as in fashionable,

00:14:24.262 --> 00:14:26.392
but cool in temperature, often

00:14:26.402 --> 00:14:28.682
taken to escape extreme heat.

00:14:29.362 --> 00:14:32.062
Glaze is to excessively or

00:14:32.132 --> 00:14:33.982
undeservedly praise someone.

00:14:34.752 --> 00:14:37.182
HENRY, all in capital letters,

00:14:37.422 --> 00:14:40.352
stands for “high earner, not rich

00:14:40.352 --> 00:14:42.322
yet”, which is used to describe

00:14:42.322 --> 00:14:45.092
someone who earns a lot of money but

00:14:45.092 --> 00:14:47.362
still feels financially squeezed.

00:14:47.832 --> 00:14:50.502
Microretirement means taking a break

00:14:50.512 --> 00:14:53.392
from work, not forever, but for a while,

00:14:53.462 --> 00:14:56.172
like a mini retirement earlier in life.

00:14:56.992 --> 00:14:59.842
Taskmasking is pretending to

00:14:59.852 --> 00:15:02.112
multitask, when in reality you’re

00:15:02.112 --> 00:15:04.192
just switching between tasks

00:15:04.252 --> 00:15:05.792
and not doing any of them well.

00:15:06.372 --> 00:15:09.072
And finally, vibe coding, which is

00:15:09.072 --> 00:15:11.612
using AI tools to build software,

00:15:12.202 --> 00:15:14.462
and it was this that was the winner.

00:15:15.812 --> 00:15:18.032
Vibe coding, if you haven’t heard

00:15:18.032 --> 00:15:20.472
the expression, refers to the way

00:15:20.802 --> 00:15:22.862
that people are now using artificial

00:15:22.882 --> 00:15:25.322
intelligence to write computer code.

00:15:25.952 --> 00:15:28.362
Instead of sitting down and typing out

00:15:28.612 --> 00:15:31.062
hundreds of lines of code manually,

00:15:31.412 --> 00:15:34.402
people–like me–are now “prompting”

00:15:34.612 --> 00:15:37.202
AI tools with natural language.

00:15:38.032 --> 00:15:40.552
Last year, I built a Chrome Extension

00:15:40.852 --> 00:15:43.202
that helps people learn new English

00:15:43.212 --> 00:15:45.882
vocabulary, as well as a tool that gives

00:15:45.882 --> 00:15:48.362
you feedback on your written English,

00:15:48.742 --> 00:15:51.892
and both of those were “vibe-coded”.

00:15:52.642 --> 00:15:54.952
I have some knowledge of software

00:15:54.952 --> 00:15:57.862
development, but most of the code was

00:15:57.872 --> 00:16:00.982
written by AI, with me checking it, rather

00:16:00.982 --> 00:16:03.862
than it being written from scratch by me.

00:16:05.062 --> 00:16:06.452
If you've done this yourself,

00:16:06.872 --> 00:16:08.332
you’ll know it's pretty magical.

00:16:08.822 --> 00:16:11.362
It’s a completely new way of building

00:16:11.362 --> 00:16:14.012
software, and it’s changing who

00:16:14.012 --> 00:16:15.892
gets to call themselves a “coder”.

00:16:16.402 --> 00:16:17.582
You no longer need to know

00:16:17.712 --> 00:16:19.612
every programming language.

00:16:19.882 --> 00:16:22.212
If you know how to ask the AI in the right

00:16:22.212 --> 00:16:25.102
way, in some cases that can be enough.

00:16:25.892 --> 00:16:27.942
So that’s vibe coding.

00:16:28.312 --> 00:16:32.452
And like 6 7, it says something

00:16:32.462 --> 00:16:33.742
about the time we are living in.

00:16:34.352 --> 00:16:36.862
One word reflects how fast the

00:16:36.862 --> 00:16:39.552
next generation is playing with

00:16:39.562 --> 00:16:41.952
language and identity online.

00:16:42.402 --> 00:16:44.432
The other reflects how fast our

00:16:44.432 --> 00:16:46.372
relationship with technology is

00:16:46.372 --> 00:16:48.412
changing, especially when it comes

00:16:48.412 --> 00:16:51.362
to work, creativity, and skills.

00:16:52.452 --> 00:16:54.312
But will people still talk

00:16:54.332 --> 00:16:56.732
about ‘vibe coding’ in 20 years?

00:16:57.032 --> 00:16:58.822
Well, most probably not.

00:16:59.232 --> 00:17:01.812
Software development might not exist in

00:17:01.812 --> 00:17:04.542
exactly the same way, and the probability

00:17:04.732 --> 00:17:07.052
of someone typing “create a signup

00:17:07.062 --> 00:17:10.502
form” into a text interface seems…slim.

00:17:11.332 --> 00:17:14.842
And as for ‘6 7’, well, like anything

00:17:14.842 --> 00:17:17.252
that starts as an ‘in-joke’, as

00:17:17.252 --> 00:17:19.712
soon as it enters the mainstream, it

00:17:19.712 --> 00:17:21.952
ceases to be funny, and stops being

00:17:21.952 --> 00:17:24.712
used, so the probability of anyone

00:17:24.932 --> 00:17:27.452
knowing what ‘6 7’ means in even

00:17:27.582 --> 00:17:30.082
10 years time seems equally slim.

00:17:31.672 --> 00:17:33.112
Some words of the year,

00:17:33.422 --> 00:17:36.032
however, do have staying power.

00:17:37.239 --> 00:17:40.412
In 2005, the New Oxford American

00:17:40.412 --> 00:17:42.612
Dictionary declared its word of the

00:17:42.612 --> 00:17:45.822
year to be a word meaning "a digital

00:17:45.842 --> 00:17:48.342
recording of a radio broadcast or

00:17:48.352 --> 00:17:51.202
similar program, made available on the

00:17:51.242 --> 00:17:54.422
internet for downloading to a personal

00:17:54.492 --> 00:17:57.702
audio player”, a word that derived from

00:17:57.702 --> 00:18:01.472
a mixture of “broadcast” and “iPod”.

00:18:02.772 --> 00:18:04.882
The word was, as you might

00:18:04.882 --> 00:18:06.792
have guessed, podcast.

00:18:07.822 --> 00:18:10.862
Back then, 20 years ago, it was not just

00:18:10.862 --> 00:18:15.112
a new word, but a new concept; the idea

00:18:15.112 --> 00:18:19.042
of downloading or streaming spoken content

00:18:19.132 --> 00:18:21.272
on demand was still relatively new.

00:18:22.272 --> 00:18:24.722
Today, of course, podcasts are

00:18:24.752 --> 00:18:26.792
everywhere, including what you

00:18:26.792 --> 00:18:28.072
are listening to right now.

00:18:29.162 --> 00:18:32.192
So, on one level, these “words of the

00:18:32.192 --> 00:18:35.132
year” lists are a bit of harmless fun.

00:18:35.522 --> 00:18:37.782
A way for a dictionary to guarantee it’s

00:18:37.802 --> 00:18:39.822
going to make the news, and cultural

00:18:39.852 --> 00:18:41.702
commentators to have something to write

00:18:41.702 --> 00:18:44.312
about during a traditional slow period of

00:18:44.312 --> 00:18:47.322
the year, even if that word or expression

00:18:47.332 --> 00:18:49.582
is forgotten a matter of 12 months later.

00:18:50.312 --> 00:18:52.152
But on another level,

00:18:52.562 --> 00:18:54.082
they’re not just words.

00:18:54.352 --> 00:18:56.256
They are snapshots.

00:18:56.462 --> 00:18:58.282
Tiny time capsules.

00:18:58.492 --> 00:18:59.862
A reflection of what

00:18:59.862 --> 00:19:01.282
people were talking about.

00:19:01.582 --> 00:19:03.352
What people were paying attention to.

00:19:03.712 --> 00:19:05.122
What people were concerned

00:19:05.132 --> 00:19:07.862
about, confused by, or inventing.

00:19:08.782 --> 00:19:10.662
Some, of course, will

00:19:10.662 --> 00:19:12.502
fade away into obscurity.

00:19:13.092 --> 00:19:15.722
Others might just shape the way we

00:19:15.722 --> 00:19:18.372
live and speak for many years to come.

00:19:19.882 --> 00:19:21.692
OK, then, that is it for today's

00:19:21.692 --> 00:19:23.942
episode on Words Of The Year.

00:19:24.242 --> 00:19:25.572
I hope it's been an interesting one

00:19:25.942 --> 00:19:27.432
and that you've learnt something new.

00:19:27.922 --> 00:19:30.142
As a reminder, this was part one

00:19:30.162 --> 00:19:32.702
of a three-part mini-series on

00:19:32.702 --> 00:19:35.322
the theme of words and language.

00:19:35.586 --> 00:19:37.196
Next up, we’ll be talking about

00:19:37.196 --> 00:19:39.246
euphemisms, and we’ll go through a
