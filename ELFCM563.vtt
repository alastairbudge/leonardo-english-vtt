Hello, hello, hello, and welcome

00:00:07.992 --> 00:00:09.802
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.802 --> 00:00:12.502
Minds, by Leonardo English, the show

00:00:12.512 --> 00:00:14.152
where you can listen to fascinating

00:00:14.152 --> 00:00:16.532
stories and learn weird and wonderful

00:00:16.542 --> 00:00:18.462
things about the world at the same

00:00:18.462 --> 00:00:20.402
time as improving your English.

00:00:20.962 --> 00:00:24.252
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are

00:00:24.262 --> 00:00:26.942
going to be talking about the Nobel Prize.

00:00:27.402 --> 00:00:30.302
For over 100 years, prizes have been

00:00:30.302 --> 00:00:33.242
awarded each year to men and women for

00:00:33.242 --> 00:00:35.472
their contributions to the fields of

00:00:35.482 --> 00:00:38.682
physics, chemistry, medicine, literature

00:00:38.882 --> 00:00:41.282
and perhaps most famously, peace.

00:00:42.012 --> 00:00:44.562
The man behind the prize is Alfred

00:00:44.622 --> 00:00:47.312
Nobel, and in today’s episode, we are

00:00:47.312 --> 00:00:49.662
going to hear his fantastic story.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.990
OK then, let’s get right into it and talk

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.190
about Alfred Nobel and the Nobel Prize.

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.100
What would someone write

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.020
about your life when you die?

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.630
If you had some magical power to see

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.430
into the future, to after you had taken

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.600
your last breath, and you were the

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.860
sort of person about whom obituaries

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.700
might be written, what would it say?

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.800
Would it say that you'd lived a good,

00:01:18.957 --> 00:01:20.907
honest life, been a good parent,

00:01:21.207 --> 00:01:23.477
brother, sister, son, or daughter?

00:01:23.837 --> 00:01:26.017
That you had made the world a better

00:01:26.017 --> 00:01:28.127
place, however that might have been?

00:01:29.477 --> 00:01:33.487
For one man in 1888, so the perhaps

00:01:33.537 --> 00:01:36.497
apocryphal legend goes, this was

00:01:36.497 --> 00:01:39.587
not a fantasy, but a reality.

00:01:40.973 --> 00:01:44.343
In 1888, the Swedish businessman

00:01:44.433 --> 00:01:47.513
and inventor, Ludvig Nobel, died.

00:01:48.083 --> 00:01:50.243
News of his death was sent by

00:01:50.293 --> 00:01:53.343
telegram, but one French newspaper

00:01:53.573 --> 00:01:55.763
seemed to have got a bit mixed up.

00:01:56.493 --> 00:01:59.233
Instead of writing the obituary for

00:01:59.233 --> 00:02:02.173
the recently deceased Ludvig Nobel, it

00:02:02.173 --> 00:02:04.523
published the obituary of his very much

00:02:04.533 --> 00:02:07.663
still-breathing younger brother, Alfred.

00:02:09.087 --> 00:02:11.937
It was not a glowing report on Alfred

00:02:11.947 --> 00:02:15.027
Nobel’s life; instead, it described him

00:02:15.027 --> 00:02:18.067
as “the merchant of death,” a man who

00:02:18.067 --> 00:02:20.537
“became rich by finding ways to kill

00:02:20.547 --> 00:02:22.987
more people faster than ever before.”

00:02:24.097 --> 00:02:26.217
Don’t worry, we’ll come to why they

00:02:26.217 --> 00:02:27.837
might have called him this in a minute.

00:02:29.017 --> 00:02:31.167
Alfred Nobel read his obituary,

00:02:31.547 --> 00:02:34.127
presumably pinched himself to confirm

00:02:34.127 --> 00:02:37.167
that he wasn’t, in fact, dead, and must

00:02:37.167 --> 00:02:38.957
have decided that he didn’t like the

00:02:38.957 --> 00:02:41.297
idea of being remembered in this way.

00:02:42.137 --> 00:02:45.357
He couldn’t change his past, but he could

00:02:45.617 --> 00:02:49.107
change his future, and importantly, how

00:02:49.107 --> 00:02:51.517
he would be remembered after his death.

00:02:52.547 --> 00:02:55.837
So, in his last will and testament, he

00:02:55.837 --> 00:02:58.207
declared that his considerable fortune

00:02:58.467 --> 00:03:00.357
would go towards the establishment of

00:03:00.357 --> 00:03:02.717
a prize for outstanding achievements

00:03:02.867 --> 00:03:05.647
in five fields: physics, chemistry,

00:03:05.817 --> 00:03:08.487
medicine, literature, and peace.

00:03:09.797 --> 00:03:13.490
Now, Ludvig Nobel did die in 1888,

00:03:13.627 --> 00:03:15.897
and his brother Alfred did leave

00:03:15.897 --> 00:03:18.167
his fortune for the establishment of

00:03:18.167 --> 00:03:20.487
the Nobel Prize, but there are some

00:03:20.487 --> 00:03:22.507
questions about the truthfulness

00:03:22.567 --> 00:03:24.877
of this obituary mix-up story.

00:03:25.397 --> 00:03:27.517
It is often reported, but it

00:03:27.517 --> 00:03:29.357
doesn’t appear on the official

00:03:29.617 --> 00:03:32.507
Nobel Prize website and is dismissed

00:03:32.517 --> 00:03:34.687
as a myth by many historians.

00:03:35.467 --> 00:03:38.387
And like many legends, this one is

00:03:38.387 --> 00:03:41.137
no doubt retold because it sounds

00:03:41.377 --> 00:03:43.887
like it could be true: an elderly man

00:03:44.167 --> 00:03:46.617
sees how he will be remembered and

00:03:46.617 --> 00:03:48.397
wants to do something to change it.

00:03:49.607 --> 00:03:51.607
As to whether it is true, I will leave

00:03:51.607 --> 00:03:53.867
you to come to your own conclusions, but

00:03:54.107 --> 00:03:57.447
to understand why this then 54-year-old

00:03:57.457 --> 00:03:59.587
Swedish businessman might have found

00:03:59.587 --> 00:04:01.277
himself described as a “merchant of

00:04:01.277 --> 00:04:04.407
death”, and why he might have decided

00:04:04.567 --> 00:04:06.117
he wanted to do something about it,

00:04:06.477 --> 00:04:08.747
we need to go right back to the start.

00:04:10.347 --> 00:04:14.817
He was born in 1833 in Stockholm, Sweden.

00:04:15.797 --> 00:04:17.537
He came from a middle-class

00:04:17.537 --> 00:04:19.667
family, but one that found

00:04:19.667 --> 00:04:22.467
itself perpetually short on cash.

00:04:23.537 --> 00:04:25.897
His father, Immanuel Nobel,

00:04:26.117 --> 00:04:28.167
was an inventor and engineer.

00:04:28.897 --> 00:04:30.657
A clever man, clearly, and

00:04:30.837 --> 00:04:33.197
one full of ideas, but not

00:04:33.237 --> 00:04:35.007
always the best businessman.

00:04:35.877 --> 00:04:38.157
Like many inventors and engineers,

00:04:38.457 --> 00:04:41.247
he had grand dreams and a habit

00:04:41.467 --> 00:04:43.307
of pursuing ambitious projects

00:04:43.517 --> 00:04:45.257
that didn’t always work out.

00:04:46.417 --> 00:04:48.697
As a result, the family struggled

00:04:48.697 --> 00:04:51.117
financially in Alfred’s early years.

00:04:51.677 --> 00:04:53.647
When he was just five years old, his

00:04:53.647 --> 00:04:56.327
father was forced to declare bankruptcy.

00:04:57.017 --> 00:04:59.237
The family had to leave their comfortable

00:04:59.247 --> 00:05:01.687
home in Stockholm and start anew.

00:05:02.747 --> 00:05:05.307
His father, however, didn’t give up.

00:05:05.817 --> 00:05:07.877
He moved to Russia to seek

00:05:07.907 --> 00:05:09.487
new opportunities, leaving

00:05:09.487 --> 00:05:11.057
his family behind in Sweden.

00:05:11.697 --> 00:05:15.517
It was a bold move, but it paid off.

00:05:16.547 --> 00:05:19.127
In St. Petersburg, he managed to convince

00:05:19.127 --> 00:05:21.817
the Russian military to invest in his

00:05:21.817 --> 00:05:24.527
inventions, particularly underwater

00:05:24.537 --> 00:05:27.057
mines and underwater explosives.

00:05:28.177 --> 00:05:29.937
Before long, he was running a

00:05:29.957 --> 00:05:32.277
successful armaments factory and

00:05:32.477 --> 00:05:34.037
had made enough money to bring

00:05:34.037 --> 00:05:35.757
the whole family over to join him.

00:05:36.497 --> 00:05:38.857
So Alfred Nobel, at the age

00:05:38.857 --> 00:05:40.827
of nine, moved to Russia.

00:05:42.207 --> 00:05:44.927
There, he and his brothers were given a

00:05:44.977 --> 00:05:47.657
private education that was far better than

00:05:47.657 --> 00:05:49.247
what they would have received in Sweden.

00:05:49.687 --> 00:05:51.447
They studied science,

00:05:51.537 --> 00:05:53.357
literature, and languages.

00:05:54.027 --> 00:05:56.277
And the young Alfred turned

00:05:56.277 --> 00:05:58.397
out to be a gifted student.

00:05:59.757 --> 00:06:02.147
By the time he was a teenager, he could

00:06:02.147 --> 00:06:05.057
speak five languages fluently: Swedish,

00:06:05.337 --> 00:06:08.197
Russian, French, English and German.

00:06:09.647 --> 00:06:11.547
He had a particular interest in

00:06:11.557 --> 00:06:14.457
literature and poetry, which led to

00:06:14.457 --> 00:06:16.647
tensions with his father, who wanted

00:06:16.647 --> 00:06:18.857
his sons to follow in his footsteps and

00:06:19.057 --> 00:06:22.057
become engineers, not poets or writers.

00:06:23.157 --> 00:06:25.077
Eventually, the young boy was sent

00:06:25.087 --> 00:06:27.257
abroad to complete his education.

00:06:27.947 --> 00:06:30.397
He travelled around Europe and studied

00:06:30.397 --> 00:06:33.087
chemistry in Paris, where he was taught by

00:06:33.087 --> 00:06:34.947
some of the leading scientists of the day.

00:06:35.957 --> 00:06:38.747
And it was in Paris that he met a man

00:06:38.927 --> 00:06:41.197
who would change the course of his life:

00:06:41.857 --> 00:06:44.385
the Italian chemist Ascanio Sobrero.

00:06:45.464 --> 00:06:48.167
Sobrero had recently discovered a highly

00:06:48.177 --> 00:06:51.087
explosive substance called nitroglycerin.

00:06:51.587 --> 00:06:54.792
It was far more powerful than gunpowder,

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:58.697
but it was also extremely unstable.

00:06:59.897 --> 00:07:02.287
For gunpowder to explode, you need

00:07:02.287 --> 00:07:05.017
some kind of spark or flame; it

00:07:05.027 --> 00:07:06.877
won’t just explode on its own.

00:07:08.257 --> 00:07:11.177
Nitroglycerin was far less predictable;

00:07:11.497 --> 00:07:14.167
even the smallest movement or change in

00:07:14.197 --> 00:07:16.387
temperature could cause it to explode.

00:07:17.781 --> 00:07:20.417
Sobrero saw its power, but

00:07:20.727 --> 00:07:22.507
believed it was too dangerous and

00:07:22.517 --> 00:07:25.067
unstable to have any practical use.

00:07:26.507 --> 00:07:28.467
Alfred Nobel disagreed.

00:07:29.017 --> 00:07:31.667
He became fascinated with the idea of

00:07:31.837 --> 00:07:35.157
taming nitroglycerin, of finding a way to

00:07:35.157 --> 00:07:37.567
make it stable enough for practical use.

00:07:38.527 --> 00:07:40.337
And this wasn’t, by the way,

00:07:40.337 --> 00:07:42.037
because he was fascinated by

00:07:42.037 --> 00:07:44.437
weapons or he had some great desire

00:07:44.567 --> 00:07:46.347
to develop military technology.

00:07:46.787 --> 00:07:49.787
His intended use for it, and where he

00:07:49.787 --> 00:07:52.037
thought the biggest commercial opportunity

00:07:52.037 --> 00:07:55.247
lay, was in construction or mining.

00:07:56.397 --> 00:07:59.057
This was the second half of the 19th

00:07:59.077 --> 00:08:01.627
century; roads and railways were

00:08:01.637 --> 00:08:03.827
being laid across Europe and North

00:08:03.827 --> 00:08:06.447
America, and mines were being dug.

00:08:07.197 --> 00:08:09.367
You could hire hundreds of people to

00:08:09.377 --> 00:08:11.077
dig a tunnel through a mountain with

00:08:11.447 --> 00:08:13.817
pickaxes and shovels…or you could

00:08:13.817 --> 00:08:16.057
just blow it up with explosives.

00:08:16.897 --> 00:08:20.227
It would be cheaper, quicker and–perhaps

00:08:20.247 --> 00:08:22.047
unexpectedly given we’re talking

00:08:22.047 --> 00:08:24.417
about blowing things up–even safer.

00:08:25.727 --> 00:08:27.577
And it’s this obsession with

00:08:27.577 --> 00:08:29.167
explosives that would come to

00:08:29.167 --> 00:08:31.837
define the next chapter of his life.

00:08:33.067 --> 00:08:35.637
Nobel returned to Sweden and

00:08:35.707 --> 00:08:38.137
threw himself into experiments.

00:08:38.607 --> 00:08:40.807
He set up a laboratory in the back

00:08:40.837 --> 00:08:43.217
of his father’s factory, and spent

00:08:43.357 --> 00:08:46.427
countless hours mixing chemicals, testing

00:08:46.427 --> 00:08:49.717
compounds, and trying to work out how

00:08:49.747 --> 00:08:52.267
to make nitroglycerin safer to handle.

00:08:53.307 --> 00:08:55.517
The potential was enormous,

00:08:55.917 --> 00:08:57.647
but so was the danger.

00:08:58.847 --> 00:09:00.977
As you might imagine, there were frequent

00:09:00.997 --> 00:09:04.517
accidents: some small, others deadly.

00:09:05.367 --> 00:09:08.537
In 1864, a massive explosion at the

00:09:08.537 --> 00:09:11.767
factory killed five people, including

00:09:12.084 --> 00:09:13.797
Alfred’s younger brother Emil.

00:09:14.367 --> 00:09:17.427
It was a devastating blow, personally,

00:09:17.427 --> 00:09:19.487
of course, but also professionally.

00:09:20.027 --> 00:09:21.167
There were calls for his

00:09:21.167 --> 00:09:23.117
experiments to be shut down.

00:09:23.887 --> 00:09:26.617
Local authorities banned the production

00:09:26.627 --> 00:09:29.057
of nitroglycerin within the city limits,

00:09:29.337 --> 00:09:31.557
and clearly, nobody wanted to live

00:09:31.787 --> 00:09:33.987
next to the Nobel explosives factory.

00:09:35.117 --> 00:09:37.157
But Nobel didn’t stop.

00:09:37.697 --> 00:09:40.197
Instead, he moved the work onto a

00:09:40.207 --> 00:09:43.037
barge–a boat–anchored in the middle

00:09:43.037 --> 00:09:45.447
of a lake, far from anyone who might

00:09:45.447 --> 00:09:47.097
be harmed if something went wrong.

00:09:48.527 --> 00:09:50.677
And then, after years of

00:09:50.677 --> 00:09:53.297
experimentation, he made a breakthrough.

00:09:54.547 --> 00:09:56.567
He discovered that if you mixed

00:09:56.637 --> 00:09:58.827
nitroglycerin with a kind of

00:09:59.057 --> 00:10:01.887
absorbent clay called kieselguhr,

00:10:02.237 --> 00:10:04.507
it became far more stable.

00:10:05.097 --> 00:10:07.617
You could shape it into sticks, transport

00:10:07.617 --> 00:10:09.927
it without fear of accidental explosion,

00:10:10.287 --> 00:10:14.527
and control when and how it detonated.

00:10:15.847 --> 00:10:17.847
He decided to name this new

00:10:17.847 --> 00:10:19.527
invention after the Greek

00:10:19.527 --> 00:10:22.277
word dynamis, meaning “power.”

00:10:23.547 --> 00:10:24.977
It was, as you might

00:10:24.977 --> 00:10:26.837
have guessed, “dynamite”.

00:10:28.177 --> 00:10:29.347
It was a revolution.

00:10:29.897 --> 00:10:32.367
Dynamite was cheaper, safer,

00:10:32.647 --> 00:10:33.987
and more effective than

00:10:34.097 --> 00:10:35.797
anything that had come before.

00:10:36.757 --> 00:10:39.607
Within a few years, Nobel had patented

00:10:39.607 --> 00:10:41.907
it across Europe and North America.

00:10:43.287 --> 00:10:44.787
It was used to blast tunnels

00:10:44.797 --> 00:10:46.877
through mountains, build railways,

00:10:47.157 --> 00:10:49.607
dig mines, and clear canals.

00:10:50.147 --> 00:10:53.327
Bridges, dams, and entire cities were

00:10:53.327 --> 00:10:56.020
constructed with the help of dynamite.

00:10:57.197 --> 00:10:59.664
But, as became quickly apparent,

00:10:59.984 --> 00:11:02.434
dynamite is also pretty handy

00:11:02.484 --> 00:11:04.564
for non-peaceful purposes.

00:11:05.314 --> 00:11:07.324
Although Nobel had originally

00:11:07.324 --> 00:11:10.284
intended it for industrial use, people

00:11:10.304 --> 00:11:12.594
quickly saw its military potential.

00:11:13.274 --> 00:11:15.384
It was more powerful than anything they

00:11:15.384 --> 00:11:18.004
had worked with before, and much easier

00:11:18.004 --> 00:11:20.324
to transport than older explosives.

00:11:20.994 --> 00:11:23.774
Armies began to use it for demolition,

00:11:24.094 --> 00:11:26.694
sabotage, and battlefield engineering.

00:11:27.404 --> 00:11:29.054
It also found its way into

00:11:29.074 --> 00:11:30.664
the hands of anarchists and

00:11:30.664 --> 00:11:32.374
revolutionaries, who used it in

00:11:32.374 --> 00:11:34.744
political assassinations and bombings.

00:11:36.004 --> 00:11:38.554
And dynamite wasn’t the end of it.

00:11:39.664 --> 00:11:42.044
In the 1880s, Nobel developed

00:11:42.064 --> 00:11:44.354
another explosive compound called

00:11:44.364 --> 00:11:46.504
ballistite, which was one of

00:11:46.504 --> 00:11:48.574
the first smokeless gunpowders.

00:11:49.174 --> 00:11:51.424
It was adopted by several European

00:11:51.424 --> 00:11:54.314
militaries and used in modern ammunition.

00:11:55.714 --> 00:11:58.454
This invention brought him even closer

00:11:58.624 --> 00:12:01.564
to the world of warfare and reinforced

00:12:01.564 --> 00:12:03.644
the image of him not just as an

00:12:03.654 --> 00:12:07.214
inventor but as an arms manufacturer.

00:12:08.709 --> 00:12:11.379
This left him a conflicted man.

00:12:12.389 --> 00:12:14.269
Yes, his inventions had

00:12:14.269 --> 00:12:15.379
made him very wealthy.

00:12:15.859 --> 00:12:17.349
He established factories and

00:12:17.349 --> 00:12:19.799
laboratories in over twenty countries.

00:12:19.929 --> 00:12:21.919
He held more than 350

00:12:21.929 --> 00:12:23.439
patents in his lifetime.

00:12:23.669 --> 00:12:26.109
He was a chemist, an engineer, a

00:12:26.139 --> 00:12:29.283
businessman, and a global industrialist.

00:12:30.649 --> 00:12:33.139
But his creations could and

00:12:33.139 --> 00:12:35.169
were being used to kill.

00:12:36.369 --> 00:12:39.949
He was also, increasingly, a man alone.

00:12:40.489 --> 00:12:41.529
He never married.

00:12:41.639 --> 00:12:43.759
He moved frequently, leading the

00:12:43.769 --> 00:12:46.329
French writer Victor Hugo to describe

00:12:46.329 --> 00:12:49.019
him as “Europe’s richest vagabond”.

00:12:49.629 --> 00:12:52.179
He had no permanent home, and would

00:12:52.209 --> 00:12:55.099
typically live in hotels or alone in large

00:12:55.099 --> 00:12:57.829
houses, surrounded by books and papers.

00:12:59.009 --> 00:13:01.389
He wasn’t, however, completely

00:13:01.399 --> 00:13:03.259
without friends or companionship.

00:13:04.159 --> 00:13:07.589
In the 1870s, he had placed an advert in

00:13:07.589 --> 00:13:09.919
a Viennese newspaper for a housekeeper.

00:13:11.069 --> 00:13:14.179
It read, “Wealthy, highly educated,

00:13:14.299 --> 00:13:16.459
elderly gentleman seeks lady of

00:13:16.489 --> 00:13:19.319
mature age, versed in languages, as

00:13:19.329 --> 00:13:22.139
secretary and supervisor of household.”

00:13:23.289 --> 00:13:24.939
One of the applicants was a

00:13:24.949 --> 00:13:26.979
woman called Bertha Kinsky.

00:13:27.509 --> 00:13:29.919
She was an Austrian aristocrat down on her

00:13:29.919 --> 00:13:32.699
luck, well-read, and highly intelligent.

00:13:33.569 --> 00:13:36.489
Nobel hired her, but after

00:13:36.509 --> 00:13:37.889
only a couple of years, she

00:13:37.889 --> 00:13:39.759
left to marry a former lover.

00:13:40.729 --> 00:13:42.099
That might have been the end of the

00:13:42.109 --> 00:13:45.129
story, but the two kept in touch.

00:13:45.219 --> 00:13:46.629
They continued to write

00:13:46.629 --> 00:13:47.979
to each other for decades.

00:13:48.887 --> 00:13:51.139
Bertha Kinsky—who became Bertha

00:13:51.139 --> 00:13:53.749
von Suttner—went on to become a

00:13:53.759 --> 00:13:56.159
leading figure in the peace movement.

00:13:57.034 --> 00:13:59.979
Her 1889 novel Lay Down Your Arms!

00:14:00.019 --> 00:14:01.919
became an international bestseller

00:14:02.249 --> 00:14:04.739
and helped spark a new wave of

00:14:04.869 --> 00:14:07.229
pacifist activism across Europe.

00:14:08.399 --> 00:14:10.469
In their letters, they exchanged

00:14:10.469 --> 00:14:12.679
a healthy debate over the moral

00:14:12.709 --> 00:14:15.169
implications of Nobel’s inventions.

00:14:15.849 --> 00:14:17.849
This was clearly something that he

00:14:17.849 --> 00:14:20.789
was thinking deeply about, but his

00:14:20.819 --> 00:14:23.699
conclusion, at least in one letter, was

00:14:23.699 --> 00:14:26.719
that dynamite could act as a vehicle for

00:14:26.719 --> 00:14:30.099
peace, but just in an unexpected way.

00:14:31.249 --> 00:14:33.999
To quote one letter directly: “Perhaps

00:14:34.029 --> 00:14:36.269
my factories will put an end to war

00:14:36.469 --> 00:14:38.939
sooner than your congresses: on the

00:14:38.939 --> 00:14:41.879
day that two army corps can mutually

00:14:41.879 --> 00:14:44.512
annihilate each other in a second, all

00:14:44.512 --> 00:14:47.199
civilised nations will surely recoil

00:14:47.229 --> 00:14:49.719
with horror and disband their troops.”

00:14:50.329 --> 00:14:50.959
End quote.

00:14:51.929 --> 00:14:54.789
Now, as to whether Nobel truly believed

00:14:54.789 --> 00:14:58.054
that or it was his way of legitimising his

00:14:58.054 --> 00:15:00.489
inventions and making himself feel better,

00:15:00.929 --> 00:15:02.509
I will let you be the judge of that.

00:15:03.519 --> 00:15:06.379
What is not up for debate is that when

00:15:06.389 --> 00:15:09.169
Nobel was drafting his will and deciding

00:15:09.169 --> 00:15:11.919
how best to use his considerable fortune,

00:15:12.219 --> 00:15:14.709
alongside the prizes for the sciences

00:15:14.859 --> 00:15:17.859
and medicine, he included an award for

00:15:18.349 --> 00:15:20.599
“the person who shall have done the most

00:15:20.859 --> 00:15:23.109
or the best work for fraternity between

00:15:23.119 --> 00:15:25.889
nations, for the abolition or reduction

00:15:25.899 --> 00:15:28.129
of standing armies and for the holding

00:15:28.419 --> 00:15:30.749
and promotion of peace congresses.”

00:15:32.119 --> 00:15:34.729
That became the Nobel Peace Prize.

00:15:35.919 --> 00:15:39.259
And when Alfred Nobel died, alone and

00:15:39.389 --> 00:15:43.019
without any direct heirs, in 1896 in

00:15:43.019 --> 00:15:46.409
Sanremo, in Italy, his fortune went to

00:15:46.409 --> 00:15:48.459
the establishment of this collection of

00:15:48.459 --> 00:15:51.299
five prizes: physics, chemistry, medicine,

00:15:51.379 --> 00:15:53.249
literature and, of course, peace.

00:15:54.299 --> 00:15:55.909
The sixth prize, by the way,

00:15:56.159 --> 00:15:57.989
the one in economics, was only

00:15:57.989 --> 00:16:00.959
added much later, in 1968.

00:16:01.919 --> 00:16:03.709
This fortune, by the way,

00:16:03.869 --> 00:16:06.719
was vast, equivalent to $300

00:16:06.719 --> 00:16:08.719
million in today’s money.

00:16:09.579 --> 00:16:12.559
It has since been well invested, and the

00:16:12.559 --> 00:16:15.279
Nobel Foundation now has assets of around

00:16:15.289 --> 00:16:19.369
$700 million, more than enough to continue

00:16:19.399 --> 00:16:21.849
dishing out prizes until the end of time.

00:16:22.999 --> 00:16:25.859
Now, interestingly enough, when his dying

00:16:25.859 --> 00:16:28.199
wish was first revealed, there were not

00:16:28.209 --> 00:16:30.819
rounds of applause and claps of joy.

00:16:31.149 --> 00:16:33.869
The first reaction was…confusion.

00:16:34.919 --> 00:16:37.259
He hadn’t told anyone about

00:16:37.259 --> 00:16:39.699
this wish, and–after having had

00:16:39.709 --> 00:16:41.699
numerous bad experiences with

00:16:41.709 --> 00:16:44.339
lawyers in his business career–he

00:16:44.339 --> 00:16:46.439
had drafted the will without one.

00:16:47.749 --> 00:16:50.319
As such, there were a bunch of questions

00:16:50.499 --> 00:16:53.119
to be resolved, and the organisations

00:16:53.419 --> 00:16:55.189
that he had named to administer the

00:16:55.189 --> 00:16:58.309
prize had been given no idea of the plan.

00:16:59.489 --> 00:17:02.169
His extended family fought the will, too.

00:17:02.879 --> 00:17:05.529
After all, a huge fortune was at

00:17:05.529 --> 00:17:08.469
stake, and he had pledged it all

00:17:08.789 --> 00:17:11.239
to this then theoretical prize.

00:17:12.619 --> 00:17:16.199
It took a while, but after five years and

00:17:16.309 --> 00:17:18.889
endless back-and-forth negotiations, the

00:17:18.889 --> 00:17:21.369
Nobel Prize Foundation was established.

00:17:22.649 --> 00:17:24.709
Since the first prizes were awarded

00:17:24.879 --> 00:17:27.249
in 1901, they have been awarded

00:17:27.419 --> 00:17:31.229
more than 600 times to over 1,000

00:17:31.239 --> 00:17:32.621
individuals and organisations.

00:17:33.459 --> 00:17:36.099
Some are names you’ll recognise instantly.

00:17:36.689 --> 00:17:39.139
Marie Curie, the first woman to win

00:17:39.139 --> 00:17:41.719
a Nobel Prize, and indeed the only

00:17:41.719 --> 00:17:44.489
person to win one in two different

00:17:44.489 --> 00:17:47.209
sciences: physics and chemistry.

00:17:48.099 --> 00:17:49.819
Martin Luther King Jr., for

00:17:49.979 --> 00:17:51.969
his non-violent fight for civil

00:17:51.969 --> 00:17:53.359
rights in the United States.

00:17:54.159 --> 00:17:56.749
Malala Yousafzai, the youngest-ever

00:17:56.749 --> 00:17:58.959
laureate, who stood up for the rights

00:17:58.979 --> 00:18:00.599
of girls to receive an education.

00:18:00.999 --> 00:18:01.969
Nelson Mandela.

00:18:02.349 --> 00:18:03.189
Albert Einstein.

00:18:03.679 --> 00:18:04.489
Ernest Hemingway.

00:18:04.749 --> 00:18:05.569
Mother Teresa.

00:18:06.279 --> 00:18:08.499
It is, in many ways, a

00:18:08.509 --> 00:18:10.549
roll-call of human achievement.

00:18:10.769 --> 00:18:12.349
A celebration of the

00:18:12.389 --> 00:18:14.029
best that people can do.

00:18:14.969 --> 00:18:16.999
But not all laureates

00:18:17.149 --> 00:18:18.639
are remembered so fondly.

00:18:19.119 --> 00:18:21.359
Some choices, with the benefit of

00:18:21.359 --> 00:18:23.739
hindsight, are harder to justify.

00:18:24.789 --> 00:18:27.759
In 1949, the Portuguese neurologist

00:18:28.029 --> 00:18:30.729
António Egas Moniz was awarded the

00:18:30.729 --> 00:18:33.449
Nobel Prize in Medicine for developing

00:18:33.619 --> 00:18:36.579
the prefrontal lobotomy — a procedure

00:18:36.759 --> 00:18:39.349
now widely condemned as brutal,

00:18:39.699 --> 00:18:41.999
ineffective, and deeply damaging.

00:18:42.499 --> 00:18:44.689
Thousands of patients were lobotomised

00:18:44.709 --> 00:18:46.209
across Europe and North America,

00:18:46.439 --> 00:18:48.879
often without proper consent, and

00:18:49.049 --> 00:18:51.429
often with disastrous consequences.

00:18:52.059 --> 00:18:53.459
The prize, however,

00:18:53.759 --> 00:18:55.029
has never been revoked.

00:18:56.099 --> 00:18:57.599
And then there’s the Peace

00:18:57.599 --> 00:18:59.669
Prize, which is probably the most

00:18:59.709 --> 00:19:01.289
politically charged of them all.

00:19:02.109 --> 00:19:03.969
It has been awarded to plenty of people

00:19:04.249 --> 00:19:06.909
almost universally recognised and agreed

00:19:06.909 --> 00:19:09.049
upon for their contributions: people

00:19:09.049 --> 00:19:11.789
like Mother Teresa and Nelson Mandela.

00:19:13.139 --> 00:19:17.589
But in 1973, it was awarded to Henry

00:19:17.619 --> 00:19:20.629
Kissinger and Lê Đức Thọ for their

00:19:20.649 --> 00:19:23.299
efforts to end the war in Vietnam.

00:19:24.489 --> 00:19:26.769
Lê Đức Thọ declined the prize,

00:19:26.949 --> 00:19:28.799
citing the ongoing conflict.

00:19:29.499 --> 00:19:32.279
Kissinger, on the other hand, accepted

00:19:32.279 --> 00:19:34.669
it, despite the fact that the bombing

00:19:34.669 --> 00:19:36.879
of Cambodia and Laos continued

00:19:36.909 --> 00:19:39.569
under his watch, and “Kissinger” and

00:19:39.589 --> 00:19:41.889
“peace” were not two words that many

00:19:41.889 --> 00:19:43.749
people put in the same sentence.

00:19:44.829 --> 00:19:46.859
The choice was so controversial

00:19:47.009 --> 00:19:48.539
that two members of the Nobel

00:19:48.539 --> 00:19:50.549
committee resigned in protest.

00:19:51.329 --> 00:19:53.919
So, to wrap things up, like anything,

00:19:54.169 --> 00:19:56.129
the Nobel Prize is not perfect,

00:19:56.229 --> 00:19:58.539
and not without its contradictions.

00:19:59.009 --> 00:20:00.879
It has been awarded to people now

00:20:00.899 --> 00:20:03.539
criticised as cruel and inhumane.

00:20:04.079 --> 00:20:05.819
It has been accused of being

00:20:05.829 --> 00:20:07.609
used to make political points.

00:20:08.289 --> 00:20:11.539
It is a prize made possible by dynamite.

00:20:12.229 --> 00:20:15.219
But for all its flaws, the Nobel Prize

00:20:15.379 --> 00:20:17.989
still holds enormous symbolic power.

00:20:18.839 --> 00:20:21.869
It can shine a light on discoveries no one

00:20:21.929 --> 00:20:25.079
had heard of, lift unknown writers out of

00:20:25.079 --> 00:20:28.549
obscurity, or bring global attention to a

00:20:28.589 --> 00:20:31.089
political cause that had gone unnoticed.

00:20:31.779 --> 00:20:34.559
It’s a prize that rewards ideas:

00:20:34.799 --> 00:20:36.769
ideas that push humanity forward,

00:20:37.079 --> 00:20:39.269
even if progress itself is

00:20:39.509 --> 00:20:42.211
messy, uneven, and imperfect.

00:20:43.439 --> 00:20:45.649
And perhaps that’s what

00:20:45.739 --> 00:20:47.049
Alfred Nobel had hoped for.

00:20:47.535 --> 00:20:49.624
Not to erase the past, but

00:20:49.809 --> 00:20:51.099
to influence the future.

00:20:51.609 --> 00:20:54.609
Not to rewrite his life, but to

00:20:54.609 --> 00:20:56.429
shape how it might be remembered.

00:20:57.209 --> 00:21:00.439
And more than a century later, his name is

00:21:00.439 --> 00:21:03.019
still spoken every year in connection with

00:21:03.019 --> 00:21:04.709
some of the most important breakthroughs

00:21:04.889 --> 00:21:07.429
in science, literature, and peace.

00:21:08.449 --> 00:21:11.549
And at least in my book, that isn’t

00:21:11.559 --> 00:21:13.489
such a bad way to be remembered.

00:21:15.139 --> 00:21:17.849
OK, then, that is it for today's episode

00:21:18.139 --> 00:21:20.319
on Alfred Nobel and the Nobel Prize.

00:21:20.569 --> 00:21:21.799
I hope it's been an interesting one

00:21:22.049 --> 00:21:23.539

Did you know this story

00:21:28.819 --> 00:21:29.929
about the Nobel Prize?

00:21:30.229 --> 00:21:31.829
Is there someone you think is

00:21:31.829 --> 00:21:33.899
deserving of it who hasn’t won,

00:21:34.169 --> 00:21:36.459
or someone undeserving who has?

00:21:37.519 --> 00:21:39.009
