Hello, hello, hello, and welcome

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:09.889
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:12.739
Minds, by Leonardo English, the show

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:14.429
where you can listen to fascinating

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.909
stories and learn weird and wonderful

00:00:16.919 --> 00:00:18.979
things about the world at the same

00:00:18.979 --> 00:00:20.849
time as improving your English.

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:24.559
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going

00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:27.831
to be talking about a battle of David vs.

00:00:27.831 --> 00:00:28.659
Goliath.

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:31.429
This is the story of a farmer

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.529
and a lawyer fighting DuPont, a

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:36.789
multibillion-dollar chemical company.

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:39.519
It’s a story of perseverance,

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:42.759
deceit, poison, bravery, corporate

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:44.959
greed, and one of the greatest

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:47.069
cover-ups in American history.

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:49.459
So, let’s not waste a minute

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:51.419
and get right into it.

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:56.829
The 1950s and 1960s were a golden

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.559
era for new kitchen gadgets.

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:02.839
Armed with disposable income and

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:05.559
a lust for convenience, American

00:01:05.559 --> 00:01:08.559
consumers snapped up microwaves,

00:01:08.809 --> 00:01:11.279
fridge freezers, and Tupperwares.

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:14.399
Adverts proclaimed that new cheap

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:16.459
plastic forks and knives would mean

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:18.669
families would never have to wash up

00:01:18.669 --> 00:01:21.939
again; you’d unwrap a new set of cutlery

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:24.539
with every meal, then simply throw

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:26.289
it away when you were done with it.

00:01:27.269 --> 00:01:28.639
And there was more.

00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:32.089
One company, DuPont, produced

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:33.919
a magical type of frying pan

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:35.815
that food wouldn’t stick to.

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:39.119
No longer would your morning fried

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.299
egg get stuck to the pan and burn,

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:43.759
no longer would you have to scrub

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:46.179
and soak the pan after every meal.

00:01:47.169 --> 00:01:49.729
These pans, Teflon pans, they

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:52.319
were called, were “non-stick”.

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:55.839
The adverts boasted of “saving you

00:01:55.839 --> 00:01:58.289
a load of dirty work”, and showed

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:00.529
quite how easily even the toughest

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:03.369
of foods could be simply wiped away.

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:05.779
Unsurprisingly, they

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:07.689
were an immediate hit.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.059
By the early 1960s, these

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.209
pans were everywhere.

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.689
In the US, it’s estimated that by the end

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.069
of that decade, over 60% of households

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:22.949
had at least one Teflon-coated pan

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:25.749
in their kitchen; tens of millions

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:28.106
of families flipping pancakes and

00:02:28.106 --> 00:02:30.796
frying bacon on this miracle surface.

00:02:31.896 --> 00:02:34.136
DuPont couldn’t make them fast enough;

00:02:34.506 --> 00:02:38.194
production soared, and by the 1970s,

00:02:38.518 --> 00:02:40.866
Teflon was a global phenomenon.

00:02:41.806 --> 00:02:44.046
The company’s own figures suggest

00:02:44.086 --> 00:02:46.016
that by the late 20th century,

00:02:46.206 --> 00:02:49.216
over 90% of American kitchens

00:02:49.266 --> 00:02:51.506
had embraced nonstick cookware.

00:02:52.246 --> 00:02:55.144
It was cheap, it was clever, and it

00:02:55.144 --> 00:02:58.654
promised a life free of culinary drudgery.

00:02:59.374 --> 00:03:01.064
What was not to like?

00:03:02.144 --> 00:03:03.774
Well, it turns out that

00:03:03.774 --> 00:03:04.944
there was something.

00:03:05.544 --> 00:03:08.264
But before we get into exactly what it

00:03:08.274 --> 00:03:10.994
was, we must move out of the kitchen

00:03:11.284 --> 00:03:14.014
and fast forward a few decades, to the

00:03:14.014 --> 00:03:17.184
9th of October, 1998, to the office

00:03:17.374 --> 00:03:20.554
of Rob Bilott, a 33-year-old lawyer.

00:03:21.496 --> 00:03:24.221
He had gone to law school and landed a job

00:03:24.411 --> 00:03:27.661
at a prestigious firm in Cincinnati, Ohio.

00:03:28.711 --> 00:03:31.621
He hadn’t gone to Harvard or Yale or

00:03:31.941 --> 00:03:34.141
any of the typical universities that

00:03:34.141 --> 00:03:36.171
lawyers at his firm had attended.

00:03:36.741 --> 00:03:38.537
He had gone to Ohio State,

00:03:38.761 --> 00:03:40.571
a large public university.

00:03:41.361 --> 00:03:44.881
He was something of an anomaly, but he

00:03:44.881 --> 00:03:48.151
was hardworking, trustworthy, and he was

00:03:48.151 --> 00:03:50.891
a few months away from being made partner.

00:03:51.616 --> 00:03:52.680
It was a good job.

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:54.690
Long hours, of course.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:57.360
But it was very well-paid, and

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.670
with a young family and a wife who

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.350
had taken a career break to look

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.890
after their young boy, and plans

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:05.400
to move to a much bigger house,

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.920
well, the money would come in handy.

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.410
And on the 9th of October, 1998, Bilott

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.910
was sitting at his desk in his office.

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:19.557
His phone rang, his direct personal line.

00:04:20.357 --> 00:04:23.537
Usually, it was a secretary, sometimes a

00:04:23.537 --> 00:04:26.577
family member, or a longstanding client.

00:04:26.897 --> 00:04:28.347
The number wasn’t public

00:04:28.347 --> 00:04:29.357
information, you see.

00:04:30.387 --> 00:04:33.107
But today, it was a voice

00:04:33.437 --> 00:04:34.607
he did not recognise.

00:04:35.337 --> 00:04:38.197
It was a man, and he spoke in an accent

00:04:38.497 --> 00:04:40.997
unlike any of Bilott’s typical clients.

00:04:41.647 --> 00:04:43.397
He spoke with a distinctive

00:04:43.557 --> 00:04:46.277
southern drawl, the strong accent

00:04:46.307 --> 00:04:47.817
of the Appalachian Mountains

00:04:47.967 --> 00:04:50.827
in West Virginia, and he called

00:04:50.827 --> 00:04:52.947
him “Robbie” instead of “Rob”.

00:04:54.077 --> 00:04:55.267
Nobody called him Robbie.

00:04:55.807 --> 00:04:57.537
Only his nearest and dearest.

00:04:58.447 --> 00:05:00.547
The man went straight into it.

00:05:01.057 --> 00:05:02.907
He was a farmer, a cow farmer.

00:05:03.367 --> 00:05:05.167
His cows were dying, and

00:05:05.327 --> 00:05:06.837
he needed Rob’s help.

00:05:08.157 --> 00:05:10.307
Bilott was confused.

00:05:11.017 --> 00:05:12.627
He wasn’t a farmer, he wasn’t

00:05:12.627 --> 00:05:14.207
a vet, he was a lawyer.

00:05:14.567 --> 00:05:16.097
The man must have the wrong number.

00:05:16.937 --> 00:05:18.447
He was just about to hang up,

00:05:18.857 --> 00:05:20.827
then the man mentioned the

00:05:20.827 --> 00:05:22.827
name of Bilott’s grandmother.

00:05:23.877 --> 00:05:25.537
His ears pricked up,

00:05:26.067 --> 00:05:27.197
and the man continued.

00:05:27.907 --> 00:05:29.407
He was a farmer outside

00:05:29.457 --> 00:05:31.297
Parkersburg, in West Virginia.

00:05:32.317 --> 00:05:34.237
He'd got Bilott’s number through a

00:05:34.247 --> 00:05:36.537
friend who knew Bilott’s grandmother,

00:05:37.017 --> 00:05:39.767
and, being proud of her grandson working

00:05:39.767 --> 00:05:41.677
at a fancy law firm in the big city,

00:05:42.037 --> 00:05:43.847
although she didn’t really know what

00:05:43.887 --> 00:05:46.527
Billot did, she'd told her friend to

00:05:46.557 --> 00:05:49.287
tell the farmer to “give Robbie a call”.

00:05:50.127 --> 00:05:53.177
The farmer’s name was Wilbur “Earl”

00:05:53.277 --> 00:05:56.297
Tennant, and his cows had been

00:05:56.297 --> 00:05:59.217
mysteriously dying in terrible ways.

00:05:59.847 --> 00:06:01.817
Their teeth had turned black,

00:06:02.007 --> 00:06:04.037
their eyes sunk inside their head.

00:06:05.117 --> 00:06:08.037
In two years, at least 150

00:06:08.047 --> 00:06:10.253
had died, inexplicably.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.797
Earl knew something was wrong, and

00:06:15.087 --> 00:06:17.147
he had even been performing primitive

00:06:17.317 --> 00:06:20.327
autopsies on the dead cows, cutting them

00:06:20.327 --> 00:06:23.067
open to see if there were any clues.

00:06:24.257 --> 00:06:26.607
What he found was horrifying.

00:06:27.367 --> 00:06:30.917
Swollen organs, the build-up of strange

00:06:30.987 --> 00:06:34.027
yellow liquid, dark spots on the lungs.

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:37.267
Earl couldn’t be sure, but

00:06:37.267 --> 00:06:38.517
it looked like cancer to him.

00:06:39.537 --> 00:06:41.437
He thought it was coming from

00:06:41.437 --> 00:06:43.267
the water the cows were drinking.

00:06:43.937 --> 00:06:45.857
The stream that ran through his

00:06:45.857 --> 00:06:48.177
land, water that had once been

00:06:48.247 --> 00:06:51.517
crystal clear, was a murky kind

00:06:51.517 --> 00:06:54.807
of colour and had a strange foam.

00:06:55.937 --> 00:06:57.967
The cows drank this water,

00:06:58.527 --> 00:07:00.977
then died in their droves.

00:07:02.203 --> 00:07:04.797
Earl thought the water was poisoned,

00:07:05.217 --> 00:07:07.667
and he knew who was doing it.

00:07:08.677 --> 00:07:10.177
There was a landfill that

00:07:10.177 --> 00:07:11.837
was leaking into the stream.

00:07:12.507 --> 00:07:14.107
It was meant to be a landfill

00:07:14.107 --> 00:07:17.167
for non-hazardous waste: paper,

00:07:17.607 --> 00:07:20.017
general rubbish, and so on, but

00:07:20.407 --> 00:07:22.607
clearly, something very nasty

00:07:22.607 --> 00:07:23.947
was coming out of that landfill,

00:07:24.457 --> 00:07:26.907
something that was killing his cows.

00:07:28.417 --> 00:07:30.617
The landfill was owned by

00:07:30.687 --> 00:07:32.717
DuPont, one of the largest

00:07:32.717 --> 00:07:34.757
chemical companies in the world.

00:07:36.183 --> 00:07:38.510
Earl wasn’t the sort of man to sit

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:41.480
idly by while his livelihood crumbled.

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:43.700
He’d been raising cattle for

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:46.110
decades, and he knew his land

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:47.670
like the back of his hand.

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:51.710
This wasn’t a case of bad luck or poor

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:55.430
farming; something was seriously amiss.

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:58.710
He’d gone to the local authorities,

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.040
spoken to neighbours, even called

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.590
in a vet or two, but no one

00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:05.120
could give him a straight answer.

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:09.430
The stream, which had once been a lifeline

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:12.720
for his herd, was now a suspect, and

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:15.770
the landfill upstream, owned by DuPont,

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:18.260
was the only thing that made sense.

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:22.201
But DuPont wasn’t just any company.

00:08:22.701 --> 00:08:25.521
It was a titan: billions in revenue,

00:08:25.831 --> 00:08:28.541
tens of thousands of employees, a name

00:08:28.821 --> 00:08:31.061
synonymous with corporate America.

00:08:31.781 --> 00:08:34.251
And Earl Tennant, well, he

00:08:34.251 --> 00:08:36.351
was a small-time cow farmer.

00:08:37.351 --> 00:08:39.321
Bilott listened as the man on

00:08:39.321 --> 00:08:41.471
the phone poured out his story.

00:08:42.051 --> 00:08:44.121
He could hear the desperation in

00:08:44.121 --> 00:08:46.401
the man’s voice, the rough edge

00:08:46.591 --> 00:08:47.831
of someone who’d been fighting

00:08:47.831 --> 00:08:49.741
a losing battle for too long.

00:08:50.808 --> 00:08:52.765
Earl explained how he’d tried to

00:08:52.765 --> 00:08:55.875
get help locally–lawyers, officials,

00:08:56.165 --> 00:08:58.395
anyone–but no one would touch it.

00:08:59.005 --> 00:09:01.955
DuPont was too big, too powerful,

00:09:02.335 --> 00:09:05.115
and Parkersburg was its town.

00:09:06.255 --> 00:09:08.895
The plant employed half the area,

00:09:09.095 --> 00:09:12.085
directly or indirectly, and the idea

00:09:12.085 --> 00:09:14.455
of challenging them was unthinkable.

00:09:15.665 --> 00:09:18.205
But Earl wasn’t most people.

00:09:18.645 --> 00:09:20.785
He’d tracked down Bilott through this

00:09:20.945 --> 00:09:23.325
tenuous family connection, hoping

00:09:23.565 --> 00:09:25.645
“Robbie” might be the one to listen.

00:09:27.065 --> 00:09:29.185
Bilott wasn’t sure what to make of it.

00:09:29.705 --> 00:09:31.845
He wasn’t an environmental lawyer,

00:09:32.205 --> 00:09:33.845
nor did he have any experience

00:09:33.845 --> 00:09:35.955
with cows or water quality.

00:09:36.555 --> 00:09:39.265
His world was contracts and boardrooms.

00:09:40.215 --> 00:09:43.055
And, what’s more, his job was

00:09:43.055 --> 00:09:45.035
to defend companies like DuPont,

00:09:45.115 --> 00:09:46.635
against people like Earl.

00:09:47.325 --> 00:09:49.795
Hanging up would’ve been the easy

00:09:49.795 --> 00:09:52.222
thing; politely excuse himself, wish

00:09:52.222 --> 00:09:54.372
the man luck, and get back to his day.

00:09:55.692 --> 00:09:57.472
But that mention of his

00:09:57.482 --> 00:09:59.302
grandmother stuck with him.

00:09:59.852 --> 00:10:02.062
It wasn’t just a name drop; it

00:10:02.062 --> 00:10:04.512
was a nod to his own past, a

00:10:04.722 --> 00:10:06.782
reminder of where he’d come from.

00:10:07.952 --> 00:10:10.322
So, against his better judgement,

00:10:10.682 --> 00:10:12.292
he said he’d take a look.

00:10:13.042 --> 00:10:14.492
“Send me what you’ve got,” he

00:10:14.492 --> 00:10:16.712
told Earl, expecting maybe a

00:10:16.742 --> 00:10:19.002
few letters or a water sample.

00:10:20.252 --> 00:10:23.022
What arrived was something else entirely.

00:10:23.662 --> 00:10:26.372
A few days later, boxes landed

00:10:26.402 --> 00:10:28.342
on Bilott’s desk, tattered,

00:10:28.822 --> 00:10:31.032
heavy, and stuffed to the brim.

00:10:31.832 --> 00:10:33.752
There were handwritten notes,

00:10:34.192 --> 00:10:37.215
photographs, and, most unsettlingly,

00:10:37.582 --> 00:10:40.362
video tapes Earl had recorded himself.

00:10:41.302 --> 00:10:44.582
The footage was shaky but vivid:

00:10:45.092 --> 00:10:47.442
dead cows sprawled across the

00:10:47.442 --> 00:10:50.062
field, their bloated bodies a

00:10:50.242 --> 00:10:52.802
stark contrast to the green grass.

00:10:53.532 --> 00:10:56.162
There were close-ups of blackened

00:10:56.222 --> 00:10:58.902
teeth, hollowed-out eyes, and those

00:10:58.972 --> 00:11:02.062
amateur autopsies: Earl cutting into

00:11:02.062 --> 00:11:03.802
the carcasses with a kitchen knife,

00:11:04.132 --> 00:11:06.902
pulling out blackened or bloated organs.

00:11:08.682 --> 00:11:11.372
Alongside the tapes were jars of

00:11:11.422 --> 00:11:14.282
murky water from the stream, labelled

00:11:14.282 --> 00:11:16.672
with dates and angry scrawls.

00:11:17.762 --> 00:11:19.832
It was a mess, but it

00:11:19.832 --> 00:11:20.942
was a compelling one.

00:11:22.382 --> 00:11:24.442
Bilott couldn’t unsee it.

00:11:25.372 --> 00:11:26.442
He started digging.

00:11:27.432 --> 00:11:29.742
His first step was cautious.

00:11:30.312 --> 00:11:32.482
He used his position as a corporate

00:11:32.482 --> 00:11:35.472
lawyer to request information from DuPont.

00:11:36.392 --> 00:11:38.732
He knew the system, he knew how

00:11:38.732 --> 00:11:41.442
to phrase things to get a response

00:11:41.472 --> 00:11:43.292
without raising too many eyebrows.

00:11:44.495 --> 00:11:46.535
What came back was a trickle of

00:11:46.535 --> 00:11:48.775
paperwork–standard reports about

00:11:48.775 --> 00:11:50.965
the landfill, assurances it was

00:11:50.975 --> 00:11:53.485
all above board, nothing hazardous.

00:11:54.765 --> 00:11:57.275
But Bilott wasn’t satisfied.

00:11:58.005 --> 00:12:00.325
He pushed harder, filing formal

00:12:00.335 --> 00:12:03.755
legal requests, and that’s when he

00:12:03.755 --> 00:12:06.365
stumbled across something odd: a

00:12:06.395 --> 00:12:08.985
chemical name buried in the documents.

00:12:09.845 --> 00:12:11.189
PFOA.

00:12:11.525 --> 00:12:13.675
Perfluorooctanoic acid.

00:12:14.924 --> 00:12:16.792
It didn’t mean much to him at first,

00:12:17.022 --> 00:12:20.312
just another jargon term in a sea

00:12:20.422 --> 00:12:23.682
of corporate babble, but it kept

00:12:23.872 --> 00:12:26.242
cropping up, tied to the Parkersburg

00:12:26.272 --> 00:12:29.532
plant and the production of Teflon.

00:12:30.702 --> 00:12:33.762
Teflon, that nonstick wonder from the

00:12:33.762 --> 00:12:36.502
1950s, the one that had taken over

00:12:36.502 --> 00:12:40.629
kitchens worldwide, relied on PFOA.

00:12:41.402 --> 00:12:44.072
It was the secret sauce, the thing

00:12:44.262 --> 00:12:47.082
that made Teflon slick and effortless.

00:12:48.212 --> 00:12:51.282
DuPont had been using it since the 1940s,

00:12:51.622 --> 00:12:54.182
churning it out in massive quantities

00:12:54.362 --> 00:12:57.292
at plants like the one near Earl’s farm.

00:12:58.892 --> 00:13:01.182
By the 1990s, it was a

00:13:01.252 --> 00:13:03.662
cornerstone of their business, a

00:13:03.672 --> 00:13:06.342
multi-billion-dollar industry built

00:13:06.592 --> 00:13:09.042
on frying pans and convenience.

00:13:10.002 --> 00:13:12.722
But as Bilott sifted through the

00:13:12.722 --> 00:13:15.532
papers, he began to suspect there

00:13:15.532 --> 00:13:18.562
was more to PFOA than met the eye.

00:13:19.498 --> 00:13:21.619
He wasn’t a chemist, but he

00:13:21.619 --> 00:13:23.129
could read between the lines,

00:13:23.239 --> 00:13:25.949
and something seemed off.

00:13:27.293 --> 00:13:29.369
But he was conflicted.

00:13:30.169 --> 00:13:31.909
He was a company man, or

00:13:31.909 --> 00:13:33.063
at least, he had been.

00:13:33.799 --> 00:13:36.499
His job was to protect firms

00:13:36.509 --> 00:13:38.189
like DuPont, not fight them.

00:13:39.009 --> 00:13:41.309
Chemical companies paid his bills,

00:13:41.349 --> 00:13:43.109
which paid for his house, his

00:13:43.409 --> 00:13:45.539
car, his very comfortable life.

00:13:46.989 --> 00:13:48.929
But this was different; it

00:13:48.929 --> 00:13:52.094
seemed deliberate, callous, and

00:13:52.434 --> 00:13:54.374
right there in black and white.

00:13:55.874 --> 00:13:56.974
He couldn’t walk away.

00:13:57.704 --> 00:14:02.344
In August 1999, he took a leap: he filed

00:14:02.374 --> 00:14:05.534
a federal lawsuit against DuPont on

00:14:05.534 --> 00:14:08.094
behalf of Earl Tennant, the cow farmer.

00:14:09.274 --> 00:14:11.804
It was a small case, focused on one

00:14:11.804 --> 00:14:15.554
farmer and his cows, but it was a start.

00:14:17.103 --> 00:14:21.403
At first, Bilott only had hints; PFOA in

00:14:21.403 --> 00:14:24.643
the water, dead cows, DuPont’s denials.

00:14:25.663 --> 00:14:29.503
But as the case unfolded, he dug deeper,

00:14:30.103 --> 00:14:32.903
and what he found was staggering.

00:14:33.993 --> 00:14:36.253
DuPont’s own records, internal

00:14:36.253 --> 00:14:38.443
studies they hadn’t intended for

00:14:38.443 --> 00:14:41.023
public eyes, showed they’d known

00:14:41.033 --> 00:14:44.213
about the dangers of PFOA for years.

00:14:45.493 --> 00:14:48.373
As far back as the 1960s, their

00:14:48.483 --> 00:14:51.673
scientists had flagged it as toxic.

00:14:52.573 --> 00:14:55.763
Lab tests on rats and rabbits linked it to

00:14:55.763 --> 00:14:59.693
liver damage, cancer, and birth defects.

00:15:00.863 --> 00:15:03.913
By the 1980s, they had data on

00:15:03.983 --> 00:15:06.713
their own workers–women at the

00:15:06.723 --> 00:15:08.663
Parkersburg plant who’d given birth

00:15:08.693 --> 00:15:10.823
to babies with eye deformities,

00:15:11.233 --> 00:15:13.823
others reporting strange illnesses.

00:15:15.293 --> 00:15:16.963
When he saw what DuPont had been

00:15:16.973 --> 00:15:18.956
doing, he paused for a moment.

00:15:20.026 --> 00:15:21.806
He saw that DuPont hadn’t

00:15:21.806 --> 00:15:24.496
just ignored the red flags; it

00:15:24.496 --> 00:15:26.176
had built a wall around them.

00:15:27.126 --> 00:15:30.626
In 1981, after two workers’ babies were

00:15:30.626 --> 00:15:33.926
born with eye defects, DuPont had quietly

00:15:33.926 --> 00:15:36.906
moved pregnant staff off PFOA lines.

00:15:37.256 --> 00:15:39.386
No public word, no recall.

00:15:40.346 --> 00:15:41.866
Studies piling up in the

00:15:41.866 --> 00:15:44.376
labs–cancer in rats, liver

00:15:44.376 --> 00:15:46.856
damage–were stamped ‘confidential,’

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:49.610
locked away from prying eyes.

00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:54.010
By 1984, it had tested Parkersburg’s

00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:57.050
water and found sky-high PFOA

00:15:57.050 --> 00:16:00.900
levels, yet told no one, claiming

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:03.320
its own safe limit was flexible.

00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:07.260
When Bilott came knocking, DuPont sent

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:10.740
him 100,000 pages of documents and

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:13.815
reports, contracts, memos, and faxes,

00:16:14.135 --> 00:16:16.455
hoping it would be too much for him,

00:16:16.805 --> 00:16:18.475
or at least it would take him too

00:16:18.485 --> 00:16:21.285
long to sift through, and perhaps his

00:16:21.305 --> 00:16:23.465
colleagues would pull him off the project.

00:16:24.715 --> 00:16:25.545
It almost did.

00:16:26.775 --> 00:16:28.625
As you might imagine, few

00:16:28.625 --> 00:16:30.615
people at Billot’s law firm were

00:16:30.655 --> 00:16:32.635
particularly pleased with the young

00:16:32.635 --> 00:16:34.445
lawyer’s interest in this case.

00:16:35.155 --> 00:16:37.845
His firm thrived on corporate

00:16:37.845 --> 00:16:40.465
clients, and there he was,

00:16:40.715 --> 00:16:42.595
biting the hand that fed them.

00:16:43.815 --> 00:16:46.334
DuPont fought back, naturally.

00:16:47.084 --> 00:16:48.764
It commissioned a study with the

00:16:48.764 --> 00:16:50.634
Environmental Protection Agency,

00:16:51.054 --> 00:16:52.874
claiming the landfill was fine,

00:16:53.244 --> 00:16:56.144
the cows’ deaths a fluke, Earl’s

00:16:56.144 --> 00:16:57.464
fault, not the fault of the company.

00:16:58.514 --> 00:17:00.954
It painted him as an incompetent

00:17:00.964 --> 00:17:02.863
farmer who didn’t know his trade.

00:17:04.233 --> 00:17:06.103
Bilott saw through it.

00:17:06.643 --> 00:17:08.533
He kept pressing, demanding

00:17:08.533 --> 00:17:10.813
more documents, and what he

00:17:10.843 --> 00:17:13.313
uncovered next was staggering.

00:17:14.256 --> 00:17:18.183
PFOA wasn’t just in Earl’s stream, it

00:17:18.183 --> 00:17:21.463
was in the drinking water for 70,000

00:17:21.473 --> 00:17:23.893
people in the Ohio River Valley,

00:17:24.343 --> 00:17:27.043
stretching across West Virginia and Ohio.

00:17:28.113 --> 00:17:30.383
This wasn’t a lone farmer’s

00:17:30.383 --> 00:17:32.753
problem; it was a public health

00:17:32.833 --> 00:17:35.613
crisis, hidden in plain sight.

00:17:36.473 --> 00:17:38.253
The water that was killing the

00:17:38.253 --> 00:17:40.853
cows was the same water that was

00:17:40.853 --> 00:17:43.463
being drunk by tens of thousands

00:17:43.673 --> 00:17:46.223
of unsuspecting nearby residents.

00:17:47.363 --> 00:17:51.193
By 2001, Bilott escalated things.

00:17:51.833 --> 00:17:53.563
He filed a class-action

00:17:53.573 --> 00:17:56.093
lawsuit, representing everyone

00:17:56.313 --> 00:17:58.133
whose water had been tainted.

00:17:59.293 --> 00:18:02.383
It was a monumental shift; tens of

00:18:02.393 --> 00:18:04.993
thousands of people, all potentially

00:18:04.993 --> 00:18:07.053
poisoned by the same chemical

00:18:07.243 --> 00:18:09.221
that made their pans nonstick.

00:18:10.423 --> 00:18:13.503
DuPont doubled down, burying him

00:18:13.713 --> 00:18:15.653
in legal motions and paperwork,

00:18:15.893 --> 00:18:18.393
hoping he’d buckle under the weight.

00:18:19.493 --> 00:18:22.033
But Bilott was relentless.

00:18:22.463 --> 00:18:25.223
He worked late nights, poring over files,

00:18:25.503 --> 00:18:27.923
building a case that couldn’t be ignored.

00:18:29.223 --> 00:18:31.773
His family saw less of him, his

00:18:31.933 --> 00:18:34.153
wife and son adjusting to a man

00:18:34.183 --> 00:18:36.133
increasingly consumed by this

00:18:36.133 --> 00:18:38.293
fight, but he couldn’t stop.

00:18:38.783 --> 00:18:41.073
The evidence was too damning.

00:18:42.473 --> 00:18:45.633
In 2004, after years of

00:18:45.753 --> 00:18:47.523
wrangling, DuPont settled.

00:18:48.643 --> 00:18:52.793
The figure was over $300 million, a

00:18:52.803 --> 00:18:56.293
hefty sum, but Bilott had insisted on

00:18:56.293 --> 00:18:59.473
something more valuable: the truth.

00:19:00.881 --> 00:19:03.951
Part of the deal funded something called

00:19:03.961 --> 00:19:07.411
the C8 Health Project, a massive study

00:19:07.691 --> 00:19:10.501
to test the blood and health records

00:19:10.681 --> 00:19:14.131
of 69,000 people in the affected area.

00:19:15.481 --> 00:19:18.981
It took seven years, but the results,

00:19:19.021 --> 00:19:20.891
which were finally released in

00:19:20.891 --> 00:19:24.581
2011 and 2012, were unequivocal.

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:28.761
PFOA was linked to six diseases:

00:19:29.141 --> 00:19:31.021
kidney cancer, testicular

00:19:31.021 --> 00:19:33.401
cancer, thyroid disease, high

00:19:33.401 --> 00:19:36.126
cholesterol, ulcerative colitis,

00:19:36.401 --> 00:19:38.781
and pregnancy-induced hypertension.

00:19:40.341 --> 00:19:42.811
This wasn’t guesswork; it was

00:19:42.811 --> 00:19:44.951
science, and it was devastating.

00:19:46.161 --> 00:19:48.021
Armed with this, Bilott

00:19:48.231 --> 00:19:49.521
went back to court.

00:19:50.301 --> 00:19:55.231
Between 2015 and 2017, he filed over

00:19:55.231 --> 00:19:59.471
3,500 personal injury lawsuits for

00:19:59.481 --> 00:20:01.571
individuals who’d suffered: people

00:20:01.571 --> 00:20:04.001
with cancer, children with defects,

00:20:04.291 --> 00:20:06.511
families shattered by illness.

00:20:08.011 --> 00:20:11.751
DuPont and its spinoff, Chemours, settled

00:20:11.821 --> 00:20:18.345
again in 2017, this time for $671 million.

00:20:19.013 --> 00:20:20.753
It was a victory, of sorts,

00:20:21.003 --> 00:20:23.173
financial compensation for thousands,

00:20:23.463 --> 00:20:26.253
but Bilott still wasn’t done.

00:20:27.573 --> 00:20:28.773
He’d learned something bigger:

00:20:29.643 --> 00:20:33.083
PFOA, and its family of “forever

00:20:33.083 --> 00:20:37.023
chemicals” called PFAS, didn’t go away.

00:20:37.893 --> 00:20:41.223
They lingered in water, soil, and

00:20:41.223 --> 00:20:44.113
blood forever, hence the name.

00:20:45.203 --> 00:20:47.223
Studies showed the presence of these

00:20:47.223 --> 00:20:51.853
chemicals in 99% of people worldwide, a

00:20:52.053 --> 00:20:55.253
silent legacy of nonstick convenience.

00:20:56.853 --> 00:21:01.283
In 2018, Bilott took his boldest step yet.

00:21:02.203 --> 00:21:06.053
He filed a lawsuit against DuPont, 3M,

00:21:06.053 --> 00:21:09.253
and others, this time for every American

00:21:09.443 --> 00:21:12.923
with PFAS in their system; essentially,

00:21:13.213 --> 00:21:16.073
a lawsuit on behalf of the whole country.

00:21:17.643 --> 00:21:20.253
He wasn’t after damages, not yet,

00:21:20.563 --> 00:21:23.973
but answers: a court-ordered panel to

00:21:23.973 --> 00:21:26.573
study the full toll of these chemicals.

00:21:27.853 --> 00:21:30.023
That case is still dragging

00:21:30.023 --> 00:21:32.633
on, a testament to the scale

00:21:32.823 --> 00:21:34.123
of what he’d uncovered.

00:21:35.573 --> 00:21:37.913
Earl Tennant sadly didn’t live to see

00:21:37.913 --> 00:21:42.233
it; he died of cancer in 2009, most

00:21:42.243 --> 00:21:44.373
probably from the very poison he’d

00:21:44.373 --> 00:21:48.293
fought, but his call to “Robbie” was

00:21:48.293 --> 00:21:49.903
the thing that had started it all.

00:21:51.383 --> 00:21:53.773
So what’s happened since then?

00:21:54.333 --> 00:21:57.043
DuPont has paid out hundreds of millions,

00:21:57.193 --> 00:22:01.133
and PFOA has been phased out in the US.

00:22:02.203 --> 00:22:03.863
It's been replaced by alternatives

00:22:04.153 --> 00:22:06.913
that are supposedly much less harmful.

00:22:07.743 --> 00:22:10.873
But PFAS are still everywhere:

00:22:11.073 --> 00:22:13.973
in rivers, wildlife, and,

00:22:14.423 --> 00:22:16.473
almost certainly, you and me.

00:22:17.793 --> 00:22:20.153
Fortunately, there is growing awareness

00:22:20.153 --> 00:22:22.303
of the dangers of these chemicals and

00:22:22.513 --> 00:22:24.953
more information on what can be done

00:22:25.173 --> 00:22:26.993
to minimise your exposure to them.

00:22:27.983 --> 00:22:30.063
Much like in previous decades, when

00:22:30.353 --> 00:22:32.313
awareness grew about the dangers of

00:22:32.473 --> 00:22:35.553
smoking, alcohol, and processed foods,

00:22:35.883 --> 00:22:38.183
perhaps “forever chemicals” will be

00:22:38.183 --> 00:22:40.513
the next thing the world wakes up to.

00:22:41.567 --> 00:22:44.273
For Earl Tennant, for his cows, for

00:22:44.273 --> 00:22:46.123
the countless children born with

00:22:46.143 --> 00:22:49.023
birth defects and for the Parkersburg

00:22:49.033 --> 00:22:51.943
residents who died of strange cancers,

00:22:52.453 --> 00:22:54.583
unfortunately, it is too late.

00:22:55.453 --> 00:22:58.303
For them, there truly was a hidden

00:22:58.303 --> 00:23:01.123
cost to a cheap non-stick pan.

00:23:02.723 --> 00:23:04.663
OK then, that is it for today's

00:23:04.663 --> 00:23:07.363
episode on Rob Bilott, Earl Tennant,

00:23:07.563 --> 00:23:09.273
and the fight against DuPont.

00:23:09.863 --> 00:23:11.273
If you’re interested in diving

00:23:11.273 --> 00:23:13.633
into this story, Rob Bilott wrote

00:23:13.633 --> 00:23:15.463
an excellent book on the subject,

00:23:15.503 --> 00:23:17.843
called Exposure, which a lot of the

00:23:17.843 --> 00:23:20.273
material from this episode comes from.

00:23:20.683 --> 00:23:21.983
There is also a movie about

00:23:21.983 --> 00:23:24.013
this called Dark Waters, which

00:23:24.013 --> 00:23:25.373
I would certainly recommend.

00:23:25.632 --> 00:23:27.890
And there are a bunch of other interesting

00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:30.200
websites and videos that talk more

00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:33.790
about the safety levels of PFAS and have

00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:36.350
some guidance on what you can do if you

00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:38.290
want to minimise your exposure to them.

00:23:38.703 --> 00:23:39.973
I’d just recommend googling

00:23:40.173 --> 00:23:42.053
“PFAS” to find out more.

00:23:42.873 --> 00:23:45.033
You've been listening to English Learning

00:23:45.033 --> 00:23:47.743
for Curious Minds by Leonardo English.

00:23:48.303 --> 00:23:51.123
I'm Alastair Budge, you stay safe, and

00:23:51.123 --> 00:23:53.533
I'll catch you in the next episode.
