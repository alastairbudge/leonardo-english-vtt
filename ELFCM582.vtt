Hello, hello, hello, and welcome

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.140
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.950
Minds, by Leonardo English, the show

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.720
where you can listen to fascinating

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.200
stories and learn weird and wonderful

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.299
things about the world at the same

00:00:19.299 --> 00:00:21.039
time as improving your English.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.509
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.939
are kicking off another three-part

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.206
mini-series, our last for 2025.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.460
The theme for this month will be “Gli

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.080
Anni Di Piombo”, the “Years Of Lead”,

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.880
the almost twenty-year period of

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.910
post-war Italian history that was marred

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.020
by violence, terrorism, and murder.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.260
In part one, today’s episode, we’ll

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.320
be talking about the early years,

00:00:50.513 --> 00:00:53.046
focussing on the bombing at Milan’s

00:00:53.046 --> 00:00:55.320
Piazza Fontana, the search for the

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.156
culprits, and its political fallout.

00:00:58.369 --> 00:01:00.559
In part two, we’ll talk about the

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.930
Red Brigades and the kidnapping

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.180
and “people’s trial” of the

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.610
former Prime Minister, Aldo Moro.

00:01:08.099 --> 00:01:10.960
And in part three, it’ll be the final

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.430
years, the bombing of the Bologna

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.050
train station, the state crackdown

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.720
in its aftermath, and the legacy

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.340
this period has on modern Italy.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.990
OK then, let's not waste a

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.541
minute and get right into it.

00:01:28.131 --> 00:01:31.279
It's easy to romanticise the Italy of

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.699
the 1960s: handsome young men with jet

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.540
black hair, beautiful women with bright

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.240
red lipstick, the hustle and bustle of a

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.589
cafe in the morning, the smell of coffee

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.330
from the espresso machine, the beeping

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.510
horns of mopeds from the streets outside.

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.949
And in the afternoon of December the

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.970
12th, 1969, some version of this scene

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.049
was no doubt being played out up and

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.609
down the country, a nation that had

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.559
only recently celebrated its 100th

00:02:07.559 --> 00:02:10.613
anniversary as one, unified state.

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:14.470
In Milan, Italy’s second-largest

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.550
city and industrial centre, it

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:18.800
might have seemed like it would

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:20.690
be an afternoon like any other.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.983
In the headquarters of the Banca

00:02:23.983 --> 00:02:27.120
Nazionale dell'Agricoltura, the National

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.180
Agricultural Bank, just a stone’s throw

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.510
away from Milan’s central cathedral,

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.020
the business day was drawing to a close.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.680
It was four-thirty in the afternoon,

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:42.690
but the bank at Piazza Fontana

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.100
was still full of customers, with

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.940
people from the countryside who

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.010
had travelled into the city to do

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.830
their business before the weekend.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.260
Many would never make it home.

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:59.950
At 16:37, there was a huge explosion

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.610
in the central atrium of the bank.

00:03:03.749 --> 00:03:05.740
Fourteen people were killed

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.000
instantly, while three more

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.920
would die from their wounds.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.490
88 people were injured.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.060
Nobody knew it at the time, but it

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.709
would mark the beginning of a nearly

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:22.579
two-decade-long period that would

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:24.716
come to be known as “gli anni di

00:03:24.716 --> 00:03:28.500
piombo”, the “years of lead”, two

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.920
decades of modern Italian history

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.396
that would see an astonishing 14,591

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.250
“acts of political violence”, an

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:42.960
average of two every single day.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.109
Now, before we get into the details,

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.619
let me add one little disclaimer.

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:54.020
This period is full of mystery and

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:57.050
intrigue; the lines between left and

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.830
right are blurred, the Italian state is

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.220
not one, single entity, and this is one

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.130
of the most controversial and emotive

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.590
periods in recent Italian history.

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.579
So if there are generalisations,

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:14.250
I hope you will excuse them.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.460
I actually listened to an Italian

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:20.140
podcast about this period, and the

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:22.409
narrator spent the first twenty

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:24.830
minutes giving a very long disclaimer.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.319
This one is shorter, and I won’t

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.409
stop every two minutes to say “this

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:32.950
is a generalisation” or to explain

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:34.999
the difference between two slightly

00:04:35.049 --> 00:04:37.670
different right-wing groups, as that

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:40.030
would firstly be tedious, and it would

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:41.810
also mean we’d be here for hours.

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.869
So, phew, we’ve got that out of the way.

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.230
But before we get right into the

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.970
years of lead themselves, and to

00:04:50.989 --> 00:04:54.559
better understand why Italy lived

00:04:54.559 --> 00:04:57.600
through such a tumultuous period, and

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.630
for the purposes of today’s episode,

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.730
what all started it, we must remind

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.079
ourselves of what was happening before.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.270
Italy, let’s remember, was

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.180
still a very young country,

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.080
little more than 100 years old.

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.570
For centuries, it had been a

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.939
patchwork of kingdoms and city-states.

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:23.909
Someone from Turin in the north would

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.439
most probably have felt more in common

00:05:26.829 --> 00:05:29.479
with someone across the border in Geneva

00:05:29.489 --> 00:05:33.079
or Nice than with their “fellow” Italian

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.179
from Naples or Palermo, in the south.

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.049
And when the Kingdom of Italy was

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.960
created in 1861, and this collection of

00:05:44.989 --> 00:05:47.440
different regions was stitched together

00:05:47.573 --> 00:05:49.920
and given the name of Italy, well,

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:53.200
these divides didn’t go away overnight.

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:56.530
The richer, more industrialised

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.889
north and the poorer, agrarian south.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.810
The city and the countryside, and

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:04.830
of course, between regions with

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:07.300
centuries of rivalry between them.

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:10.960
Italy was united on a national

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.440
level, but significant differences

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:14.990
and divisions remained.

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:19.040
Little more than fifty years into the

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.453
creation of Italy came World War I.

00:06:22.099 --> 00:06:24.469
And shortly afterwards, Mussolini

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:26.469
and twenty years of Fascism.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.440
For these two decades, the Fascist

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:33.290
Party controlled every aspect of life.

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:36.460
And when Mussolini fell, in

00:06:36.593 --> 00:06:39.920
1943, his political ideology

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:41.759
did not disappear with him.

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:45.560
Fascism might have been discredited,

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:48.380
but it certainly did not go away.

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:51.570
It remained like a ghost,

00:06:51.929 --> 00:06:54.190
hanging over Italian politics.

00:06:55.269 --> 00:06:57.650
And the other important factor, when

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:59.880
it comes to understanding the years of

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:03.359
lead, is what was happening in Italy

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:05.849
at the end of the Second World War.

00:07:07.109 --> 00:07:09.729
Italy was initially allied with

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:12.479
Nazi Germany, but switched sides in

00:07:12.489 --> 00:07:15.229
1943, surrendering to the Allies.

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:18.430
What this meant was that for the

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:21.090
last two years of the war, the

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:23.849
country was effectively split in two.

00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:26.880
In the north, German troops and

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.060
the remnants of Mussolini’s fascist

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:31.760
regime fought bitterly against

00:07:31.799 --> 00:07:33.759
partisan resistance fighters.

00:07:34.249 --> 00:07:36.460
In the south, mostly American and

00:07:36.469 --> 00:07:38.790
British Allied soldiers occupied

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:41.106
the country and pushed northwards.

00:07:41.979 --> 00:07:47.670
By 1945, peace had returned to Europe, but

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:51.580
Italy was exhausted and deeply divided.

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:54.920
And almost immediately, it found

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.229
itself on the front line of

00:07:57.229 --> 00:07:59.330
a new conflict: the Cold War.

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:03.369
Italy had the largest Communist

00:08:03.379 --> 00:08:05.359
Party in Western Europe, which

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:08.229
was directly supported by Moscow.

00:08:08.929 --> 00:08:12.330
But it was also home to powerful

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:15.050
Catholic and conservative forces

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:17.310
that looked in the other direction,

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.729
to Washington for protection.

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:25.599
So, for the CIA and the KGB alike, Italy

00:08:26.049 --> 00:08:28.289
was not just another European country:

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:31.189
it was an ideological battleground.

00:08:32.673 --> 00:08:34.599
And while all of this was playing

00:08:34.599 --> 00:08:37.439
out, Italy was changing fast.

00:08:38.119 --> 00:08:42.369
In the 1950s and 60s the country

00:08:42.369 --> 00:08:45.280
experienced what was called the miracolo

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:47.810
economico, the “economic miracle.”

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:51.470
Millions of Italians left the poor

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:53.560
countryside of the south to work

00:08:53.579 --> 00:08:55.880
in the booming industrial north, in

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:58.960
cities like Milan, Turin, and Genoa.

00:08:59.839 --> 00:09:02.660
This was the era of Fiat, of the

00:09:02.839 --> 00:09:05.369
spaghetti Western, of Sofia Loren

00:09:05.379 --> 00:09:07.810
and Federico Fellini, of Italy

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:10.550
becoming a rich, modern state.

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:14.270
Perhaps it’s hard to imagine it as

00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:17.010
anything other, but let me give you

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:19.609
some statistics to illustrate quite

00:09:19.629 --> 00:09:23.099
how fast and steep this transition was.

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:30.439
In 1955, only 3% of Italians had a fridge

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:33.849
at home, and 1% had a washing machine.

00:09:34.559 --> 00:09:41.660
By 1975, the figures were 94% and 76%.

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:44.700
And in a similar period,

00:09:45.139 --> 00:09:47.740
average incomes tripled.

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:50.440
It was a huge transformation.

00:09:50.869 --> 00:09:52.790
A veritable “miracle”.

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:56.420
But this miracle was uneven.

00:09:57.239 --> 00:09:58.759
While some Italians grew

00:09:58.759 --> 00:10:01.040
rich, many were left behind.

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:03.200
The South remained poor.

00:10:03.569 --> 00:10:06.109
The new urban workers were crammed

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:08.109
into overcrowded neighbourhoods.

00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:11.159
They were overworked and underpaid.

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:14.020
Strikes and protests

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:15.690
became part of daily life.

00:10:16.079 --> 00:10:18.409
Students occupied universities.

00:10:18.599 --> 00:10:20.849
Workers occupied factories.

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:25.319
The autumn of 1969 became known

00:10:25.319 --> 00:10:28.700
as “Hot Autumn” and was marked by

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:31.010
protests and strikes for better

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:32.909
pay and working conditions.

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:36.760
Meanwhile, the ghost of fascism

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.740
was emerging from the shadows.

00:10:39.109 --> 00:10:41.470
The sense of crisis was everywhere.

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:46.079
By the end of the 1960s, Italy was

00:10:46.119 --> 00:10:48.910
a country of contradictions: modern

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:51.929
and prosperous on the surface, but

00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:54.970
fragile and unstable underneath.

00:10:55.849 --> 00:10:58.610
And it was in this Italy — divided,

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:01.469
restless, and full of tension — that

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:03.549
the bombs began to explode.

00:11:04.859 --> 00:11:07.490
Indeed, the explosion at the bank in

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:09.710
Milan was not the only bomb that day.

00:11:10.679 --> 00:11:13.920
In Rome, three bombs exploded at

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:16.210
almost exactly the same time, with

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:18.790
injuries but fortunately no casualties.

00:11:19.519 --> 00:11:21.960
Another was discovered before it went off.

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:26.080
Clearly, this was a coordinated effort.

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:30.519
But, perhaps surprisingly, nobody

00:11:30.559 --> 00:11:32.860
claimed responsibility for the attack.

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:36.550
Within hours, investigators announced

00:11:36.579 --> 00:11:39.539
that far-left anarchists were to blame.

00:11:40.469 --> 00:11:42.849
Leaflets and manifestos from

00:11:42.849 --> 00:11:44.779
radical anarchist groups had been

00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:47.279
circulating, and the police quickly

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:49.499
rounded up dozens of suspects.

00:11:50.662 --> 00:11:53.960
One of them was a 41-year-old railway

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:56.459
worker called Giuseppe Pinelli, who

00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:58.899
was a well-known anarchist in Milan.

00:11:59.773 --> 00:12:01.669
Pinelli was taken to the

00:12:01.669 --> 00:12:03.819
police station for questioning.

00:12:04.589 --> 00:12:07.620
But after three days of interrogation,

00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:11.520
onlookers would see him crashing out of

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:13.780
the fourth-floor window of the police

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:16.510
headquarters, falling to his death.

00:12:17.849 --> 00:12:20.780
The official verdict was initially

00:12:21.119 --> 00:12:22.689
that he had committed suicide.

00:12:23.929 --> 00:12:26.670
Few bought this, and his death would

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:28.510
become one of the most infamous

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:31.480
episodes of the period, a symbol of

00:12:31.589 --> 00:12:35.200
police brutality and the deep mistrust

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:37.900
between the Italian state and the left..

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:41.649
Now, we will return to Pinelli and

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:44.200
what might really have happened in

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:46.589
a few moments, but we must first

00:12:46.599 --> 00:12:49.299
move on with this fast-moving story.

00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:53.349
The day after Pinelli’s death, the police

00:12:53.379 --> 00:12:55.970
announced they had arrested another man.

00:12:56.950 --> 00:13:00.229
His name was Pietro Valpreda, and he

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:02.720
was a member of a small anarchist group.

00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:06.950
Valpreda protested his innocence and

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:09.040
pointed out that the only evidence

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:11.079
against him was the testimony

00:13:11.329 --> 00:13:13.819
of a taxi driver, who said he

00:13:13.819 --> 00:13:15.240
had dropped him off at the bank.

00:13:16.859 --> 00:13:20.899
The evidence seemed…shaky, at best, but

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:24.490
Valpreda was quickly cast as "the monster

00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:28.290
of Piazza Fontana" and thrown into jail.

00:13:29.329 --> 00:13:31.680
He had to wait three years for a trial,

00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:34.690
then by the time the trial took place,

00:13:35.009 --> 00:13:37.960
the only witness against him–the taxi

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:40.139
driver–had died of a heart attack.

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:44.230
Valpreda would spend the best part of

00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:47.110
the next two decades in the Italian

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:49.839
judicial system, and it wouldn’t be until

00:13:49.839 --> 00:13:54.710
1985–16 years after the attack–that he

00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:57.220
was eventually acquitted of all charges.

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:00.000
As you’ll see throughout this

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.609
mini-series, the wheels of the Italian

00:14:02.619 --> 00:14:05.200
judicial system move very slowly,

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:08.050
and aren’t always very just at all.

00:14:08.769 --> 00:14:12.390
So, if Pinelli and Valpreda didn’t

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:15.909
plant the bomb, who did, and why?

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:19.579
Well, it has now been attributed to

00:14:19.579 --> 00:14:23.149
a far-right, neo-fascist group called

00:14:23.273 --> 00:14:26.249
Ordine Nuovo – New Order, in English.

00:14:27.119 --> 00:14:29.280
The possible involvement of this group,

00:14:29.569 --> 00:14:31.970
and the fact that it was an attack by

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:35.020
the far-right rather than the far-left,

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:38.060
was something the authorities were aware

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:40.869
of relatively soon after the attack.

00:14:41.649 --> 00:14:43.869
But there are accusations

00:14:44.069 --> 00:14:46.009
that actors within the police

00:14:46.429 --> 00:14:47.770
might have covered this up.

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:49.640
Why?

00:14:49.859 --> 00:14:52.200
Why might it have been advantageous for

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:55.000
the bombings to be pinned on the far left?

00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:58.470
Well, one theory is that this

00:14:58.470 --> 00:15:01.699
was not just a cover-up, but part

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:03.910
of a broader pattern, a way of

00:15:04.139 --> 00:15:06.870
using fear to manipulate politics.

00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:11.230
By carrying out acts of terrorism against

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:14.129
civilians, and then blaming them on the

00:15:14.129 --> 00:15:17.560
left, far-right extremists — sometimes

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:20.300
with the knowledge or protection of

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:23.119
parts of the state — they could frighten

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:25.829
ordinary Italians into demanding

00:15:25.839 --> 00:15:27.869
stronger security measures and a

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.819
tougher, more authoritarian government.

00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:34.430
In the years that followed, this

00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:36.909
pattern would appear again and again:

00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:39.280
bombings that targeted innocent

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:41.689
people, rushed accusations against

00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:44.560
the far left, and investigations

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:47.149
that mysteriously fell apart.

00:15:48.229 --> 00:15:50.929
Journalists and magistrates would later

00:15:50.929 --> 00:15:53.543
call this la strategia della tensione,

00:15:53.619 --> 00:15:57.329
the “strategy of tension”, a campaign of

00:15:57.329 --> 00:16:00.609
fear intended to keep Italy from drifting

00:16:00.609 --> 00:16:03.530
towards communism and bolstering support

00:16:03.690 --> 00:16:06.560
for a stronger, more authoritarian state.

00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:11.800
And there is also a broader, international

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:14.050
dimension, linking back to Italy’s

00:16:14.050 --> 00:16:17.210
status as a “front line” of the Cold War.

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:21.099
At the end of World War II, there

00:16:21.129 --> 00:16:23.630
were secret “stay-behind” NATO

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:26.169
operations set up across Europe, where

00:16:26.379 --> 00:16:29.170
operatives were tasked with resisting

00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:31.390
in the event of a Soviet invasion.

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:35.550
In Italy, this was called Gladio.

00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:40.500
So, its remit was to stay underground,

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:43.010
only emerging if the Red Army

00:16:43.079 --> 00:16:44.710
ever crossed the Iron Curtain.

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:48.849
But there are suspicions that Gladio

00:16:48.889 --> 00:16:51.559
operatives were a little more active

00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:52.860
than they were supposed to be.

00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:56.600
In Italy, some of these

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:58.780
networks are suspected of

00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:00.920
overlapping with the far right.

00:17:02.569 --> 00:17:05.300
As to the extent of these overlaps,

00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:08.010
well, some accuse Gladio operatives

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:11.480
of direct collaboration, of helping

00:17:11.509 --> 00:17:13.850
far-right terrorists source bombs

00:17:13.850 --> 00:17:17.463
and plan attacks, while others accuse

00:17:17.463 --> 00:17:19.839
them of simply turning a blind eye.

00:17:20.829 --> 00:17:23.290
For what it's worth, the Americans say

00:17:23.319 --> 00:17:25.460
they never collaborated with terrorists,

00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:28.300
and that this is Soviet disinformation.

00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:33.150
What does seem clear is that quite a few

00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:36.400
members of far-right groups had pretty

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:38.480
intimate knowledge of the operations

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:40.979
of Gladio, and have suggested that

00:17:40.979 --> 00:17:43.689
Gladio operatives tolerated, or even

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:46.380
encouraged, these actions of violence.

00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:50.300
It is speculation, and it’s highly

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:53.000
unlikely that the full extent of these

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.070
connections will ever come to light.

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:58.900
And on the subject of things never coming

00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:01.740
to light, and the murky connections

00:18:01.809 --> 00:18:04.540
between the police, the state, and the far

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:07.650
right, we must return to Giuseppe Pinelli,

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:10.700
the railway worker who came crashing out

00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:13.100
of the police station window to his death.

00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:16.409
As you will remember, the police

00:18:16.599 --> 00:18:19.010
initially said it was suicide, but

00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:21.330
soon there were conflicting witness

00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:24.370
reports, with other officers saying he

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:26.830
had fainted from exhaustion, that he

00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:28.840
was near the window and was so tired

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:31.320
after extensive questioning that he

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:33.929
simply fell over, out of the window.

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:39.450
Now, even if this were true, clearly

00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:41.439
the police have a responsibility to

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:43.610
anyone in custody to make sure that

00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:46.110
they don’t die, so they must bear the

00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:48.270
responsibility for Pinelli’s death.

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:51.589
And of course, many didn’t buy this

00:18:51.639 --> 00:18:54.849
official accidental verdict, suggesting

00:18:55.159 --> 00:18:57.960
instead that Pinelli was either beaten to

00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:00.280
death by the police and then thrown out of

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:02.490
the window to make it look like a suicide,

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.190
or the police were dangling him out of the

00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:08.100
window to try to get him to confess, and

00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:10.810
somehow they lost their grip and he fell.

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:15.149
And it wasn’t just general police

00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:18.600
mistrust; later autopsies were full

00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:21.840
of inconsistencies, suggesting that

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:24.630
Pinelli was likely dead before he hit

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:27.630
the ground, and suggesting he suffered a

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:30.080
serious blow to the neck before he fell.

00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:33.470
In other words, he was killed by the

00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:36.630
police, and then they threw him out of

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:38.910
the window to try to cover their tracks.

00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:42.920
Terrible in any case, and made

00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:44.920
even worse when you think about

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:46.895
the fact that Giuseppe Pinelli

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:48.080
shouldn’t have been there.

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:51.569
For starters, there is no evidence

00:19:51.729 --> 00:19:53.250
he had anything to do with

00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:54.990
the bombing; he was innocent.

00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:58.650
And secondly, Italian law says

00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:00.830
that the police can hold a suspect

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:03.640
for 48 hours without charge.

00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:06.549
After that, they have to be either

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:09.199
charged with a crime or released.

00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:13.910
Pinelli had been held for 3 days, way

00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:16.800
past the legal maximum, which indicates

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:19.810
that police might have taken to even more

00:20:19.810 --> 00:20:22.390
extreme measures to force a confession.

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:26.889
And this case gets even murkier still

00:20:27.299 --> 00:20:29.200
when you hear that the police officer

00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:32.290
who was responsible for Pinelli’s arrest

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:35.266
and interrogation, a man called Luigi

00:20:35.266 --> 00:20:39.773
Calabresi, was himself murdered in 1972,

00:20:40.123 --> 00:20:42.879
two and a half years after Piazza Fontana.

00:20:44.119 --> 00:20:47.380
His murder would be claimed by far-left

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:50.236
activists as revenge for Pinelli’s,

00:20:50.803 --> 00:20:53.270
but there are theories that he was

00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:55.550
actually murdered by the far-right,

00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:58.589
or even state elements, as he was

00:20:58.599 --> 00:21:00.690
one person who knew “the truth”.

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:04.860
Now, when talking about much of

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:06.800
the Years of Lead, it is hard

00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:09.280
not to get too pulled in to these

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:11.920
webs of conspiracies and theories.

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:15.120
After all, there is an abundance

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:17.270
of evidence that elements of the

00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:20.129
Italian secret services had obstructed

00:21:20.139 --> 00:21:22.459
investigations, hidden evidence,

00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:24.720
and even protected suspects.

00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:26.890
Files went missing.

00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:29.830
Witnesses gave contradictory testimony.

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:32.640
Judges complained of being misled

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:34.689
by the very police and intelligence

00:21:34.689 --> 00:21:36.480
services meant to help them.

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:39.230
Not just after Piazza Fontana,

00:21:39.299 --> 00:21:41.660
but throughout the Years of Lead.

00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:45.510
Some officers were later convicted,

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:47.950
not for planting bombs themselves,

00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:50.680
but for covering up who really had.

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:54.670
As to their motivations, the links

00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:56.440
they may or may not have had to

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:59.139
politicians, foreign powers, even

00:21:59.219 --> 00:22:01.170
organised criminals, that is a

00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:03.490
subject that is still debated today.

00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:07.050
What is clear is that the Piazza Fontana

00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:09.570
bombing, and the subsequent years

00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:11.690
of carnage that it unleashed, would

00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:14.269
be deeply destabilising for Italy.

00:22:15.399 --> 00:22:18.120
This strategy of tension, as it

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:20.493
would later be called, worked,

00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:22.300
or at least, it created a

00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:24.620
hostile, frightening environment.

00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:27.720
The images of the destroyed bank

00:22:27.769 --> 00:22:30.840
atrium shocked Italians: shattered

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:33.939
glass, broken marble, bloodstains

00:22:33.939 --> 00:22:35.690
on the floor where customers had

00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:37.620
been waiting only moments before.

00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:41.070
And the victims were not

00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:42.660
politicians or police officers.

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:45.150
They weren’t even political activists

00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:47.629
or protestors; they were ordinary

00:22:47.849 --> 00:22:50.670
men and women, farmers who had come

00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:52.780
in from the countryside to deposit

00:22:52.789 --> 00:22:55.270
their savings, workers finishing up

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:57.750
their business on a Friday afternoon.

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:01.310
In a country that was already on

00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:03.919
edge, the message was terrifying:

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:06.999
if you could be killed simply by

00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:09.120
walking into a bank in the centre

00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:11.860
of Milan, then nowhere was safe.

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:16.960
And Piazza Fontana was only the beginning.

00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:20.310
Over the next decade, bombs

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:22.259
would go off in trains, in public

00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:24.550
squares, at police headquarters.

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:28.229
Some were carried out by the far left, but

00:23:28.449 --> 00:23:31.250
an overwhelming majority by the far right.

00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:34.770
Hundreds of Italians would die,

00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:37.840
thousands would be injured, and entire

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:40.199
generations would grow up in a country

00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:42.989
where violence was part of daily life.

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:46.860
But perhaps the most famous and most

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:49.190
shocking episode of all was still to

00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:52.480
come: the kidnapping and murder of

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:55.020
the former Prime Minister, Aldo Moro.

00:23:55.890 --> 00:23:57.450
And that, my friends, is

00:23:57.450 --> 00:23:59.180
where we will go in part two.

00:24:01.210 --> 00:24:03.249
OK, then, that is it for today's

00:24:03.250 --> 00:24:05.289
episode on the Piazza Fontana bombing.

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:07.810
As a quick reminder, this is part one

00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:10.190
of a three-part mini-series on the

00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:12.160
years of lead, gli anni di piombo.

00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:15.450
Next up will be the Red Brigades and

00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:17.500
the kidnapping of Aldo Moro, and in

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:19.710
part three, it’ll be the bombing of the

00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:22.219
Bologna train station, and the legacy

00:24:22.219 --> 00:24:24.680
this dark period has left on the country.

00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:27.070
You've been listening to English Learning

00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:29.790
for Curious Minds by Leonardo English.

00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:33.040
I'm Alastair Budge, you stay safe, and

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:35.210
I'll catch you in the next episode.
