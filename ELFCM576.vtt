Hello, hello, hello, and welcome

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.530
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.300
Minds, by Leonardo English, the show

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:14.040
where you can listen to fascinating

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.490
stories and learn weird and wonderful

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.449
things about the world at the same

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.269
time as improving your English.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.300
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:25.470
going to be talking about a robbery.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.869
But not any robbery.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.750
It has been called the greatest bank

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.460
robbery in history, and involves the

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:37.100
sunny seaside city of Nice, sewers, red

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.440
wine, suave Frenchmen, gangsters, the

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:43.909
far right, daring escapes, motorbikes,

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.290
South America, plastic surgery, and more.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.400
So, let's not waste a minute

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:51.530
and get right into it.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.500
If you have ever been in France during the

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.070
weekend of the 14th of July, you will know

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.110
that it is one of national celebration.

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:06.120
It is a reminder of the events

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.620
of the French Revolution.

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:11.380
There are fireworks, parties, and,

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.760
of course, many people take the

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.719
opportunity to have a few days off work.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.130
1976 was no exception.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.289
Bastille Day, the 14th of July, fell on a

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.249
Wednesday that year, meaning many people

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.899
would have partaken in the time-honoured

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.590
French tradition of “le pont”, the

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.920
bridge, taking the Thursday and Friday

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.430
off so as to enjoy a five-day holiday.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.170
The following Monday, Monday 19th

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.679
July, as people dragged themselves

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:49.850
back to their places of work, and shops

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:52.789
and offices opened again, a rumour

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.399
started to gain momentum in the city

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.010
of Nice, on the south coast of France.

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:00.950
There had been a break-in at

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.780
the Société Générale bank.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.009
This wasn’t the classic bank robbery

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.800
of Hollywood movies, when someone

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.070
strolls into the bank, pulls out

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.340
a gun, tells everyone to freeze,

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.329
and then orders the cashiers to

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.586
fill up a suitcase with banknotes.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.630
No, the rumour was that there had been

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.660
a break-in in the vault, in the private

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.850
deposit boxes deep underneath the bank.

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.410
There were thousands of security

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.250
boxes, containing, well, the

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.700
bank didn’t know exactly.

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.340
Everything from jewels to secret documents

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.020
to family heirlooms, and of course, cold,

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.090
hard cash that someone might have wanted

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.370
to keep at the bank “unofficially”.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.790
Journalists started calling up

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.580
the bank asking for a statement.

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.730
Customers started queuing up outside,

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.570
demanding access to their security box,

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.960
demanding to speak with the manager.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.370
The thing was, the bank employees

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.510
couldn’t get into the vault

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.450
containing the security boxes.

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.276
The twenty-tonne door seemed jammed shut.

00:03:12.535 --> 00:03:14.360
It simply wouldn’t open.

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.100
Eventually, they were forced to drill

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.410
a hole in the wall of the vault,

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.070
finally allowing them to see inside.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.240
And what they found was

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.090
nothing short of chaos.

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.930
Hundreds of security boxes had been prised

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.070
open, their contents all over the floor.

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.140
On the wall were scrawled the words, “Ni

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.800
armes, ni violence et sans haine”, “No

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.470
weapons, no violence, and without hate”.

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:48.500
And it was true.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.840
Nobody seemed to have been

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.070
harmed, there had been no hostages

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.020
taken, no guns brandished; it

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.370
looked to have been a clean job.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:00.880
So, how did they get in?

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.870
Well, as the police looked

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.020
around the vault, the answer

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:07.610
was right in front of them.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.650
They found a large hole in

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.740
the wall, leading to a tunnel.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.500
They followed the tunnel for eight

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.950
metres and found themselves coming

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.620
out in the municipal sewer system,

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.880
the system that takes away wastewater.

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.570
It was an ingenious plan.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.330
The thieves had somehow entered the

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.540
sewer system, got to the point closest

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.450
to the bank, and tunnelled all the

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.460
way through to the wall of the vault,

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.450
timing it perfectly for a weekend

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.250
they knew would be particularly quiet.

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.600
As the police made further inspections

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:51.970
of the raided vault, it became

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.750
clear that the criminals had spent

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.910
some considerable time there.

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.610
The reason that the bank employees hadn’t

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.280
been able to open the vault was that the

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.620
door had been welded shut, completely

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.580
closed to the outside, giving the men

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.400
time to escape if they'd been discovered.

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.830
They were not, and they had clearly

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.320
managed to spend a long time in the vault.

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.940
There was a table, which it seemed that

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.520
the criminals had used to sort through

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.180
the contents of the security boxes,

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:30.260
pocketing anything of monetary value

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:33.270
and discarding anything that wasn’t.

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.460
There were even bottles of wine,

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.830
paté, a portable gas cooker, tins

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.220
of ravioli, and bread crusts.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.960
It seemed like the thieves had spent the

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.720
night, perhaps several nights, in the

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.670
vault before escaping with their loot.

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.190
And how much had been taken?

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.660
Well, the bank wasn’t exactly sure.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:04.270
The thieves had managed to open 371 safety

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:07.514
deposit boxes out of a total of 4,000.

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:10.540
Alongside this, they had managed to

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:13.090
break into the bank’s central reserve

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.700
and had taken gold bars and cash.

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.670
The haul was estimated at 50 million

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:25.000
francs, equivalent to approximately

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.490
40 million Euros in today’s money.

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:30.050
It had all the hallmarks

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:31.700
of a professional job.

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:34.760
Drilling the tunnel and ensuring it

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.990
was adequately supported, lit, and

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.060
structurally sound was no mean feat.

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.560
And as for breaking into the security

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.920
boxes, sure, the thieves hadn’t

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:49.480
managed all 4,000 of them, but

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.570
still, it was the work of people

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:53.430
who knew what they were doing.

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:56.080
What’s more, they hadn’t

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:58.310
left fingerprints or clues.

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.440
As you can imagine, the newspapers went

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:04.590
crazy, giving the criminals a name, “le

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:08.210
gang des égoutiers”, or “the sewer gang”.

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:12.344
But as for the identity of the

00:07:12.344 --> 00:07:14.914
perpetrators, the police were

00:07:14.914 --> 00:07:16.384
still at something of a loss.

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.950
All eyes first turned to a local

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:23.500
organised crime boss called Gaetano

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:27.190
Zampa, but he had a watertight alibi.

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:28.560
It wasn’t him.

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:32.860
What’s more, the message on the wall,

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:36.030
“no weapons, no violence, and without

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:38.610
hate”, this didn’t sound like Zampa.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.150
He was all about weapons and violence.

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:45.640
It wasn’t until several weeks later that

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:48.570
the Nice police got their first clue.

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:53.840
In the countryside around 15km north

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.470
of Nice, in fact, a week before

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:59.240
the raid on the bank, local police

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:01.580
had been called by a neighbour who

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:04.210
had reported a group of men acting

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:07.230
suspiciously outside a countryside villa.

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:10.030
The police arrived to

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:11.250
see what was going on.

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:14.780
The men had made up some excuse;

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:16.560
they were going to rent it from

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.440
a restaurant owner in a nearby

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:21.680
town, but something smelled fishy.

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:24.990
The police took their IDs, but because

00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:26.940
they weren’t committing any crime,

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:29.270
they were released without charge.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.410
And there was another piece of the puzzle.

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:36.430
A month before the raid, police in Nice

00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:39.360
had stopped a car one evening after

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:42.840
seeing a pair of men loading the boot with

00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:45.840
workman’s tools, the kind of tools you

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:48.610
might use if you were planning a break-in.

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:51.830
When questioned, the men’s

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:54.010
response didn’t make much sense.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:57.330
Again, fishy, but acting

00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:59.810
suspiciously isn’t a crime in itself.

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:03.770
The police realised that the two men

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:05.690
who had been stopped that evening

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:08.840
in Nice were the same as two of the

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.960
men who had been acting suspiciously

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.967
outside the villa, Daniel Michelucci

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:17.450
and Gérard Vigier, two known criminals.

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:21.200
The problem was that there was no sign

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:24.340
of Daniel Michelucci and Gérard Vigier.

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:25.850
They seemed to have

00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:28.440
disappeared into thin air.

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:31.780
The police decided to search the

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:34.880
villa to see if it held any clues.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.920
When they entered, they found traces

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:41.790
of the same mud and soil found in

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:43.950
the Nice sewers, as well as the

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:46.190
same cigarette butts and bottles of

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:48.200
wine that were found in the vault.

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:49.780
Bingo.

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:53.240
It seemed like the villa had been used

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:56.240
as a sort of staging house when planning

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.660
the raid, then the criminals had come

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:01.170
back there to divide their spoils.

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:04.130
The problem was that there

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:06.140
was no sign of the men.

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:09.070
The first breakthrough came

00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:11.070
three months after the raid.

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:14.500
A man walked into a branch of

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:17.170
Crédit Agricole, casually trying

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:20.670
to sell a handful of gold ingots.

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:24.290
But these weren’t just any ingots;

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:26.380
they were numbered, part of the

00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:29.250
stash lifted from the vault in Nice.

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:32.650
The police closed in, arrested

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:35.230
him, and the net began to tighten.

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:38.670
Within two days, two other men,

00:10:39.151 --> 00:10:41.216
Francis Pellegrin and Alain

00:10:41.216 --> 00:10:43.450
Bournat, were also behind bars.

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:46.680
The police were pleasantly surprised

00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:49.530
that these men seemed happy to talk.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:52.970
But the person they named surprised them.

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:56.560
They said that their boss, the

00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:59.910
mastermind of the entire heist, was

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:02.530
someone called Albert Spaggiari.

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:04.490
You can imagine the

00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:06.470
detectives’ first reaction.

00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:09.200
“Who? Albert Spaggiari?”

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:12.470
The name wasn’t known to the police.

00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:16.130
He wasn’t some high-level gangster, he

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:19.920
wasn’t a bank employee, he was…no one.

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:23.240
He was a photographer, and owned a

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.700
small photography studio in Nice.

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:28.570
And the police couldn’t see any

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:30.780
links to organised criminals.

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:33.870
Spaggiari had spent time in prison

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:36.900
for a burglary in Vietnam, French

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:39.920
Indochina at the time, but that was 25

00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:42.740
years before, when he was 21 years old.

00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:45.780
He seemed to be a changed man.

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:46.880
Married.

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:49.390
A popular local wedding photographer.

00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:51.720
An upstanding member of society.

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:53.790
Not a criminal mastermind.

00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:57.930
What’s more, if Spaggiari was

00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:00.430
indeed the mastermind of this great

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:03.020
crime, he wasn’t acting like it.

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:07.020
At the time of the discovery of his

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:10.310
supposed involvement, he was in Japan on

00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:13.450
a trip with the then mayor of Nice and

00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:16.481
secretary of tourism, Jacques Médecin.

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:19.900
The police waited for him to return,

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:23.220
and when he arrived back in France, on

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:27.830
October 27th, 1976, Albert Spaggiari

00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:30.200
was arrested while he was having

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:32.430
lunch at a bar outside the airport.

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.740
He acts surprised.

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:35.880
Me?

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:38.850
And the police have to admit,

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:40.950
he doesn’t seem like the type.

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:44.760
If it was him, how did he manage to

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:47.430
control a bunch of serious thugs?

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.170
Spaggiari was more of a flaneur, a

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:54.010
cigar-smoking, sunglasses-wearing,

00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:55.930
smiling local businessman,

00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:58.490
not some hardened criminal.

00:12:59.896 --> 00:13:02.546
He denies all involvement, but

00:13:02.546 --> 00:13:03.726
there’s something about his

00:13:03.726 --> 00:13:06.796
answers that seems suspicious.

00:13:07.796 --> 00:13:09.196
As if there’s something

00:13:09.206 --> 00:13:11.176
he’s keeping under wraps.

00:13:11.856 --> 00:13:14.206
Still, there is no evidence, nothing

00:13:14.216 --> 00:13:16.706
actually linking him to the crime.

00:13:18.152 --> 00:13:20.582
This all changes when the police

00:13:20.822 --> 00:13:23.062
search his isolated countryside

00:13:23.062 --> 00:13:25.412
house, more like a small farm.

00:13:26.572 --> 00:13:30.152
Inside, they find a veritable weapons

00:13:30.262 --> 00:13:33.752
cache: dynamite, guns, and ammunition.

00:13:34.622 --> 00:13:37.392
Suddenly, it seems that this

00:13:37.752 --> 00:13:40.272
honest, law-abiding photographer

00:13:41.132 --> 00:13:43.302
might not be quite what he seems.

00:13:44.392 --> 00:13:46.272
Still, he doesn’t talk.

00:13:47.282 --> 00:13:49.132
It’s only until the police tell him

00:13:49.322 --> 00:13:51.732
that if he doesn’t confess, they’ll

00:13:51.752 --> 00:13:55.362
charge his wife as well for possession

00:13:55.362 --> 00:13:57.142
of the small arsenal of weapons

00:13:57.332 --> 00:13:58.882
that they found at their farmhouse.

00:14:00.042 --> 00:14:02.692
For Spaggiari, this is too much.

00:14:03.032 --> 00:14:06.222
He says, “OK, you’ve got me”, and

00:14:06.222 --> 00:14:08.312
agrees to collaborate with the police.

00:14:09.172 --> 00:14:10.952
He was charged and thrown

00:14:10.972 --> 00:14:12.832
into jail, awaiting trial.

00:14:14.075 --> 00:14:16.939
And he starts talking, he reveals

00:14:16.939 --> 00:14:19.155
that he got the idea for the crime a

00:14:19.155 --> 00:14:21.705
couple of years beforehand, after he

00:14:21.705 --> 00:14:23.599
had heard from a neighbour who worked

00:14:23.599 --> 00:14:26.075
at the bank that the vault didn’t have

00:14:26.075 --> 00:14:28.605
an alarm or motion detection system.

00:14:29.605 --> 00:14:31.895
It was deep underground, its

00:14:31.895 --> 00:14:33.735
walls almost 2 metres thick.

00:14:34.315 --> 00:14:36.115
The bank simply didn’t think it

00:14:36.115 --> 00:14:37.925
was necessary, the neighbour said.

00:14:39.465 --> 00:14:42.175
Spaggiari wanted to test whether

00:14:42.215 --> 00:14:44.425
this was true, so he rented

00:14:44.455 --> 00:14:46.395
a deposit box at the bank.

00:14:47.555 --> 00:14:50.815
As a genuine, paying customer, he was

00:14:50.865 --> 00:14:53.695
allowed into the vault, where he secretly

00:14:53.735 --> 00:14:56.855
took pictures and made detailed notes and

00:14:56.865 --> 00:14:59.325
drawings of the interior of the vault.

00:15:00.175 --> 00:15:02.805
He also used his lockbox, but not

00:15:02.805 --> 00:15:05.855
for cash or jewels; instead, he

00:15:05.855 --> 00:15:09.035
placed an alarm clock, setting it to

00:15:09.035 --> 00:15:10.685
go off in the middle of the night.

00:15:11.605 --> 00:15:13.175
This would allow him to

00:15:13.185 --> 00:15:14.945
verify the neighbour’s claim.

00:15:16.002 --> 00:15:19.022
He also revealed that the reason for the

00:15:19.022 --> 00:15:21.952
heist was more than personal enrichment;

00:15:22.652 --> 00:15:25.272
he said that he wanted to raise money

00:15:25.492 --> 00:15:28.802
for a relatively unknown far-right

00:15:28.892 --> 00:15:32.482
organisation called La Catena, so the

00:15:32.482 --> 00:15:35.292
crime took on this political angle too.

00:15:36.002 --> 00:15:38.272
Now, whether he was simply inventing

00:15:38.272 --> 00:15:40.932
that to add to the legend and make

00:15:40.932 --> 00:15:43.852
himself sound less like a simple

00:15:43.862 --> 00:15:46.082
thief, I’ll let you be the judge.

00:15:46.752 --> 00:15:49.512
The one thing he never does is

00:15:49.642 --> 00:15:51.672
reveal the names of his accomplices,

00:15:51.672 --> 00:15:53.612
the other members of the crew.

00:15:55.102 --> 00:15:58.262
In March the following year, after

00:15:58.262 --> 00:16:01.192
four months behind bars, Spaggiari

00:16:01.412 --> 00:16:03.722
is at the courthouse in Nice, in

00:16:03.722 --> 00:16:05.952
the prosecuting judge’s office.

00:16:06.902 --> 00:16:10.222
He has a police escort, of course, but

00:16:10.562 --> 00:16:12.692
when he tells the judge that he has

00:16:12.692 --> 00:16:15.052
important information regarding the

00:16:15.052 --> 00:16:17.962
involvement of local politicians, the

00:16:17.962 --> 00:16:21.132
judge asks the police officers to leave.

00:16:21.872 --> 00:16:25.212
He knows that policemen talk, and if he

00:16:25.212 --> 00:16:27.252
wants to have a confidential conversation

00:16:27.452 --> 00:16:30.382
with Spaggiari, he needs to have it alone.

00:16:31.872 --> 00:16:34.242
Spaggiari brings out a few sheets

00:16:34.242 --> 00:16:37.262
of paper with sketches of a map of

00:16:37.262 --> 00:16:40.142
the bank area, names and arrows.

00:16:40.822 --> 00:16:44.732
The judge can’t quite understand what is

00:16:44.732 --> 00:16:47.072
written there, and he takes a closer look.

00:16:48.042 --> 00:16:50.332
But it's all a ruse.

00:16:50.832 --> 00:16:52.962
While the judge is trying to make

00:16:52.962 --> 00:16:55.272
sense of what Spaggiari has written,

00:16:55.712 --> 00:16:57.782
Spaggiari seizes the moment.

00:16:58.062 --> 00:17:00.592
He opens the window and jumps out,

00:17:00.922 --> 00:17:03.862
falling 8 metres onto a parked car,

00:17:04.292 --> 00:17:07.092
then he rolls off, runs across the road,

00:17:07.402 --> 00:17:09.792
jumps onto the back of a motorcycle,

00:17:10.072 --> 00:17:13.012
and speeds off through central Nice.

00:17:14.132 --> 00:17:18.152
This was the 10th of March, 1977,

00:17:18.642 --> 00:17:21.682
and Spaggiari is never seen again,

00:17:22.222 --> 00:17:24.822
or at least, not by the authorities.

00:17:25.872 --> 00:17:29.512
But by this point, he has grown accustomed

00:17:29.762 --> 00:17:32.452
to the fame and glamour that come with

00:17:32.462 --> 00:17:34.472
being the country’s most famous bank

00:17:34.472 --> 00:17:37.549
robber, a sort of real-life Arsène

00:17:37.549 --> 00:17:40.232
Lupin, the fictional gentleman-thief.

00:17:41.372 --> 00:17:44.372
Journalists love him and his story,

00:17:44.742 --> 00:17:46.902
and he revels in the attention.

00:17:47.892 --> 00:17:51.432
He even decides to send 5,000 francs

00:17:51.702 --> 00:17:53.802
to the person whose car he landed on

00:17:54.172 --> 00:17:56.132
after the jump from the magistrate’s

00:17:56.132 --> 00:17:59.392
office, as compensation for the damage.

00:18:00.462 --> 00:18:02.442
And he went on the run.

00:18:02.842 --> 00:18:04.952
To Italy, to Spain, and

00:18:04.952 --> 00:18:06.062
then to South America.

00:18:07.002 --> 00:18:09.442
He changed his appearance, having plastic

00:18:09.442 --> 00:18:12.322
surgery and growing a beard, but he

00:18:12.322 --> 00:18:15.062
still couldn’t resist the public eye.

00:18:15.892 --> 00:18:18.352
He did a series of interviews from

00:18:18.372 --> 00:18:21.872
Madrid in 1983, where he talked about

00:18:22.092 --> 00:18:23.832
how he planned to spend his time

00:18:23.842 --> 00:18:26.462
smoking cigars and drinking champagne,

00:18:26.812 --> 00:18:28.712
surrounded by beautiful women.

00:18:29.982 --> 00:18:33.142
He also explained in detail how he

00:18:33.162 --> 00:18:35.972
planned and executed the bank heist.

00:18:37.002 --> 00:18:39.942
He got the idea, he said, after reading

00:18:39.952 --> 00:18:43.215
a novel about a similar crime in the UK.

00:18:43.952 --> 00:18:46.482
He had the idea, scouted out the sewage

00:18:46.482 --> 00:18:49.042
works, and when he realised he would

00:18:49.042 --> 00:18:52.072
need a team to get the job done, he

00:18:52.072 --> 00:18:54.642
connected with a local organised crime

00:18:54.642 --> 00:18:57.542
gang and offered them half the spoils.

00:18:58.202 --> 00:19:00.282
And it was a huge job.

00:19:00.812 --> 00:19:03.132
The men worked every night for

00:19:03.162 --> 00:19:05.422
three months, taking the equipment

00:19:05.622 --> 00:19:07.702
for several kilometres through the

00:19:07.702 --> 00:19:10.112
sewer system, wading through human

00:19:10.212 --> 00:19:12.822
excrement, waste water, and rats,

00:19:13.102 --> 00:19:14.952
before starting the back-breaking

00:19:14.952 --> 00:19:17.102
work of digging the tunnel itself.

00:19:18.222 --> 00:19:20.492
And the plot, he revealed, was

00:19:20.722 --> 00:19:23.732
almost uncovered at the last moment.

00:19:24.592 --> 00:19:27.042
Just before the heist was scheduled

00:19:27.052 --> 00:19:29.362
to take place, the then-president of

00:19:29.372 --> 00:19:32.522
France, Giscard d'Estaing, came to Nice.

00:19:33.252 --> 00:19:35.162
Spaggiari feared that the police

00:19:35.182 --> 00:19:37.282
would do a sweep of the sewers

00:19:37.432 --> 00:19:39.242
along the president’s route and

00:19:39.242 --> 00:19:41.862
discover the tunnel, but they didn’t.

00:19:43.032 --> 00:19:45.222
He also revealed how the criminals

00:19:45.612 --> 00:19:48.972
almost never got out of the tunnel.

00:19:49.902 --> 00:19:52.032
It had rained very heavily that

00:19:52.032 --> 00:19:54.752
weekend, and the sewers were very

00:19:54.752 --> 00:19:57.102
full, practically overflowing.

00:19:58.242 --> 00:20:00.662
The men had to make several trips

00:20:00.712 --> 00:20:03.332
back and forth from the vault to

00:20:03.332 --> 00:20:06.232
carry off all their ill-gotten gains.

00:20:06.782 --> 00:20:09.262
The sewage water was up to their necks,

00:20:09.442 --> 00:20:12.152
and it was flowing so fast that it was

00:20:12.152 --> 00:20:14.922
quite a task to walk against the current,

00:20:15.202 --> 00:20:17.382
back to the vault, to get the booty.

00:20:18.482 --> 00:20:21.722
Now, despite this playboy,

00:20:21.932 --> 00:20:25.202
gentleman-thief image, Spaggiari had

00:20:25.222 --> 00:20:27.342
clearly committed a serious crime.

00:20:28.212 --> 00:20:31.602
In 1979, he was sentenced to life

00:20:31.642 --> 00:20:35.092
imprisonment, in absentia, so if he was

00:20:35.152 --> 00:20:37.832
ever caught by the police, he knew that

00:20:37.842 --> 00:20:39.912
this was the sentence that awaited him.

00:20:41.342 --> 00:20:43.592
In fact, he didn’t live for long.

00:20:44.552 --> 00:20:46.332
He had been a heavy smoker his

00:20:46.332 --> 00:20:50.732
entire life, and on June 9th, 1989,

00:20:51.182 --> 00:20:53.162
lung cancer got the better of him.

00:20:53.952 --> 00:20:55.802
He was 56 years old.

00:20:57.082 --> 00:21:00.452
Now, since his death, theories have

00:21:00.452 --> 00:21:02.712
emerged suggesting that Spaggiari

00:21:02.982 --> 00:21:04.492
might not have been the criminal

00:21:04.492 --> 00:21:06.512
mastermind he made out to be.

00:21:07.712 --> 00:21:11.162
In 2010, a well-known Marseille gangster

00:21:11.402 --> 00:21:13.962
called Jacques Cassandri published

00:21:13.992 --> 00:21:16.732
a book claiming that he was the

00:21:16.732 --> 00:21:19.612
mastermind behind the heist, and that

00:21:19.612 --> 00:21:21.972
he made the equivalent of €2 million

00:21:21.972 --> 00:21:24.232
from the raid, which he quickly spent.

00:21:25.112 --> 00:21:27.692
But as the statute of limitations

00:21:27.692 --> 00:21:29.622
had passed, he could no longer

00:21:29.622 --> 00:21:31.042
be charged with the crime.

00:21:31.722 --> 00:21:34.362
Instead, he got 30 months behind bars

00:21:34.562 --> 00:21:36.882
for a different crime, money laundering.

00:21:38.272 --> 00:21:41.032
As for Spaggiari, he is remembered in

00:21:41.032 --> 00:21:44.532
popular culture both as this successful

00:21:44.532 --> 00:21:47.472
robber, but also as something of a

00:21:47.482 --> 00:21:51.642
Narcissus, a vain man who craved attention

00:21:51.662 --> 00:21:54.062
and fame more than anything else.

00:21:55.122 --> 00:21:57.932
And the irony of it all was that,

00:21:58.272 --> 00:22:00.382
after becoming something of a celebrity

00:22:00.672 --> 00:22:03.492
and getting addicted to it, he had to

00:22:03.492 --> 00:22:06.152
stay out of the limelight to survive.

00:22:06.982 --> 00:22:09.172
According to one of his former friends,

00:22:09.432 --> 00:22:11.612
and one of the men who helped him

00:22:11.642 --> 00:22:13.852
escape on the motorcycle, he was

00:22:13.852 --> 00:22:15.642
actually quite lonely and bored.

00:22:16.782 --> 00:22:18.392
Behind the headlines, the

00:22:18.392 --> 00:22:20.902
glamour, and the mystery, what

00:22:20.902 --> 00:22:23.692
remained was a rather sad figure.

00:22:24.542 --> 00:22:26.382
A man who pulled off one of the

00:22:26.382 --> 00:22:28.952
most audacious bank robberies of

00:22:28.952 --> 00:22:31.892
the 20th century, but who spent his

00:22:31.902 --> 00:22:35.372
final years hiding, sick, and alone.

00:22:36.222 --> 00:22:38.542
It is, perhaps, not such a

00:22:38.542 --> 00:22:40.402
glamorous ending after all.

00:22:42.622 --> 00:22:44.562
OK, then, that is it for today's

00:22:44.562 --> 00:22:46.552
episode on Albert Spaggiari.

00:22:47.112 --> 00:22:48.712
I hope it was a fun one and that

00:22:48.712 --> 00:22:49.922
you’ve learned something new.

00:22:50.422 --> 00:22:52.032
If you like these types of episodes,

00:22:52.282 --> 00:22:53.422
there are actually quite a few

00:22:53.462 --> 00:22:55.552
others about famous criminals:

00:22:55.812 --> 00:22:57.442
there’s one on Bonnie and Clyde,

00:22:57.502 --> 00:22:59.692
John Dillinger, and the Kray Twins.

00:22:59.892 --> 00:23:01.142
I’ll put the links to those in the

00:23:01.142 --> 00:23:03.002
show notes, in case you’re interested.

00:23:03.772 --> 00:23:05.612
