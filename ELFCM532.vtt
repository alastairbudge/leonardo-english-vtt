Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.181 --> 00:00:16.531
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories and learn weird and

00:00:16.541 --> 00:00:20.911
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.531 --> 00:00:25.691
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is part three of this

00:00:25.701 --> 00:00:29.831
three-part mini-series on the theme of “Putin and Poison”.

00:00:30.631 --> 00:00:38.061
In part one we had a very broad overview of the life of Vladimir Putin, and of his rise to power.

00:00:38.751 --> 00:00:45.051
In part two we learned about the time his former KGB colleague, Alexander Litvinenko,

00:00:45.351 --> 00:00:52.061
took a sip of tea in an upmarket London hotel and ended up dying from radiation poisoning.

00:00:52.681 --> 00:00:58.501
And today, in part three, we are going to talk about the time that two men travelled from

00:00:58.501 --> 00:01:05.708
Moscow to the sleepy English market town of Salisbury in an attempt to murder a double agent.

00:01:06.291 --> 00:01:12.601
Yes, it is another story about poison, but it’s very different to the Litvinenko story

00:01:12.831 --> 00:01:19.421
in that it happened 12 years later, was even more brazen, and crucially, it didn’t work.

00:01:19.971 --> 00:01:23.821
So, let’s not waste a minute, and get right into it.

00:01:26.241 --> 00:01:30.971
The town of Salisbury, in the south of England, is the kind of place

00:01:31.221 --> 00:01:35.861
where there was more going on 800 years ago than there is today.

00:01:36.801 --> 00:01:44.391
It was previously a Roman settlement, and in the Medieval era, it became a major regional centre

00:01:44.741 --> 00:01:50.851
and home to one of the largest and most impressive churches in the UK: Salisbury Cathedral.

00:01:52.171 --> 00:01:57.981
Nowadays, it’s a sleepy market town, just under 50,000 inhabitants,

00:01:58.281 --> 00:02:03.521
restaurants, shops, a small theatre, and not much more than that.

00:02:04.521 --> 00:02:09.661
The only real things of note that might bring someone to Salisbury are the

00:02:09.661 --> 00:02:15.611
cathedral, which I just mentioned, Stonehenge, the prehistoric stone circle, which

00:02:15.611 --> 00:02:21.841
is 13 kilometres northwest of the town, and a small Roman settlement just outside.

00:02:23.221 --> 00:02:29.951
But in March of 2018, two men decided that it was worth a trip.

00:02:30.851 --> 00:02:36.591
They took a flight from Moscow to London on Friday, stayed a night in London

00:02:36.891 --> 00:02:41.661
before heading off to Salisbury, which is just over an hour away on the train.

00:02:42.501 --> 00:02:47.281
They wandered around the town a bit, before heading back to London for the night.

00:02:48.251 --> 00:02:52.881
Clearly not content with their trip, they returned the following day,

00:02:53.441 --> 00:02:57.531
visited the cathedral and Stonehenge before getting a train back to

00:02:57.531 --> 00:03:03.091
London and catching the 10.30pm flight back to Moscow that evening.

00:03:04.251 --> 00:03:08.111
Earlier on that day, however, something suspicious

00:03:08.331 --> 00:03:11.551
was discovered in the sleepy market town of Salisbury.

00:03:12.751 --> 00:03:19.781
In the mid-afternoon, at 4.15 pm to be precise, a man and a woman had

00:03:19.781 --> 00:03:24.821
been found unconscious on a public bench in Salisbury town centre.

00:03:26.421 --> 00:03:32.091
From a distance, passersby initially thought they were just another pair of locals who’d

00:03:32.091 --> 00:03:38.391
had too much to drink, but as they got closer, they realised something was deeply wrong.

00:03:39.451 --> 00:03:44.421
They were not tired or drunk; the woman had gone completely

00:03:44.421 --> 00:03:49.313
white, her eyes were wide open and she was foaming at the mouth.

00:03:50.373 --> 00:03:52.143
Emergency services were called.

00:03:52.683 --> 00:03:55.793
The pair were rushed to hospital and placed in

00:03:55.793 --> 00:03:59.993
intensive care where doctors fought to save their lives.

00:04:01.293 --> 00:04:06.643
They weren’t sure exactly what was wrong with them, but when they discovered

00:04:06.663 --> 00:04:11.383
the man’s identity they got a hint of what they might be up against.

00:04:12.683 --> 00:04:16.983
Unlike Alexander Litvinenko, who initially told doctors his name

00:04:16.983 --> 00:04:21.903
was Edwin Carter, this man did not operate under a pseudonym.

00:04:23.243 --> 00:04:25.973
His name was Sergey Skripal.

00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:31.863
He was a former Russian intelligence officer who had switched sides and

00:04:31.883 --> 00:04:37.843
become a double agent, secretly passing classified information to the British.

00:04:38.953 --> 00:04:43.383
He had been arrested, tried and sentenced to 13 years

00:04:43.393 --> 00:04:48.053
in prison for high treason in Russia back in 2004.

00:04:48.943 --> 00:04:55.563
But he was released in a prisoner swap for a bunch of sleeper agents, including, by the way, Anna

00:04:55.593 --> 00:05:02.587
Chapman, who you might remember from our episode on the Art of Espionage, episode number 524.

00:05:03.513 --> 00:05:08.183
Anyway, he was practically the definition of an enemy of the Russian

00:05:08.183 --> 00:05:14.013
state, and there he was, unexpectedly unconscious on a park bench.

00:05:15.023 --> 00:05:18.793
The woman who was found unconscious next to him was his daughter,

00:05:19.173 --> 00:05:23.303
whose only crime, by the way, was having a double agent for a parent.

00:05:24.633 --> 00:05:28.613
Although the British authorities didn’t know exactly what had gone on,

00:05:29.033 --> 00:05:33.093
and the police even released a statement saying that they weren’t yet sure

00:05:33.213 --> 00:05:37.973
whether a crime had been committed, they declared it a “major incident”.

00:05:39.423 --> 00:05:45.223
And the clues as to what might have happened came in an unfortunate fashion.

00:05:46.873 --> 00:05:50.988
The police had sent an officer to go and check out Sergey Skripal’s

00:05:51.003 --> 00:05:55.683
house, to check if there were any other people in it or if there was any

00:05:55.703 --> 00:06:00.093
information about what could have happened to the 66-year-old Russian man.

00:06:01.303 --> 00:06:04.643
By this point, they had figured out who he was–he wasn’t

00:06:04.643 --> 00:06:08.813
using a fake identity, so a simple Google search did the job.

00:06:09.984 --> 00:06:15.333
And given who he was, and knowing the methods often employed by the Russian

00:06:15.333 --> 00:06:19.993
state, the police decided to go into the house in protective clothing.

00:06:21.123 --> 00:06:26.103
Remember, the poisoning of Litvinenko was just 12 years before, by

00:06:26.103 --> 00:06:29.943
this point, the Russian state had quite the reputation for poison

00:06:30.203 --> 00:06:34.773
being its weapon of choice, so the police decided to take precautions.

00:06:35.913 --> 00:06:40.303
They managed to get a spare key from the neighbour and unlocked the door.

00:06:41.863 --> 00:06:47.833
There was nothing particularly unusual or incriminating about what they found in

00:06:47.833 --> 00:06:53.923
the house, but within a few hours the police officer who had been the first to

00:06:54.003 --> 00:07:00.063
enter the property–a man named Detective Sergeant Nick Bailey–started to feel ill.

00:07:00.893 --> 00:07:05.663
Within a few days, he was critically ill and was rushed to hospital.

00:07:06.643 --> 00:07:10.583
He had been wearing protective clothing, but whatever it

00:07:10.583 --> 00:07:14.423
was, it was clearly powerful enough to have got through it.

00:07:15.753 --> 00:07:20.143
Meanwhile, Sergey and Yulia Skripal were slipping in and

00:07:20.143 --> 00:07:24.063
out of consciousness, doctors fighting to save their lives.

00:07:25.303 --> 00:07:29.823
On March 12th, just over a week after they had been found unconscious,

00:07:30.133 --> 00:07:34.223
the then British Prime Minister, Theresa May, released a statement.

00:07:35.423 --> 00:07:39.943
She said that toxic analysis had shown that all three

00:07:40.393 --> 00:07:44.493
had been poisoned by the deadly nerve agent, Novichok.

00:07:45.813 --> 00:07:49.293
Now, Novichok is not your average poison.

00:07:49.923 --> 00:07:53.643
It's one of the deadliest chemical weapons ever created, and

00:07:53.803 --> 00:07:57.153
was first developed by the Soviet Union during the Cold War.

00:07:57.723 --> 00:08:02.103
It's not something you stumble across or buy off the black market.

00:08:02.523 --> 00:08:08.263
It’s a state-controlled substance, requiring advanced facilities to produce and handle.

00:08:09.133 --> 00:08:15.150
The name means “newcomer” in Russian, and it refers to a series of nerve agents

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:20.880
designed to be more potent and harder to detect than anything the West had at the time.

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:26.910
Now, Novichok works by disrupting the nervous system, causing

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:32.230
muscles to seize up, organ failure, and, in many cases, death.

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:38.210
Even the smallest amount can be fatal, and the fact that it was used in

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:44.030
Salisbury, in the middle of a peaceful English town, was both shocking and brazen.

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:48.730
Theresa May, the British Prime Minister, made it clear

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:51.830
that the substance could only have come from Russia.

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:57.500
And she said there were two possibilities about what could have happened.

00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:04.590
Either it was a state-sponsored attack, an attempted murder orchestrated by the Russian state.

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:10.460
Or that Russia had lost control of its nerve agent stockpile and

00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:15.200
had let this deadly chemical get into the hands of rogue agents.

00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:20.160
Either way, it had come from Russian labs, so what was

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:24.463
it, a state-sponsored murder or bureaucratic incompetence?

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:30.700
Most commentators in the UK saw this as May not directly attacking

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:35.280
Putin, but at least offering the possibility of incompetence.

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:39.540
However, to the British authorities, it became

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:43.360
increasingly probable it was the former, not the latter.

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:47.470
And this was deeply problematic.

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:53.370
Sergey Skripal might have been charged as a traitor in Russia but he was not

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:59.370
in Russia, and he had been officially pardoned in 2010, eight years before.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.130
And not only that.

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:07.350
He had been given British citizenship and was living quietly in the UK.

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:13.140
Now I should add that it has since been claimed that Skripal was not living

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:18.450
quite as quiet a life as it was originally made out and he was still doing some

00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:23.730
intelligence work on the side, thereby making him a slightly more legitimate target.

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:27.150
This has not been publicly confirmed.

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:31.530
And in any case, he was a middle-aged British civilian

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:34.860
who seemed to have put his previous life behind him.

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:41.640
And the assassination of a British citizen in Britain, regardless of what

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:45.577
he might have done in a previous life, would have required authorisation

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:49.880
from Putin himself, so the British intelligence authorities believed.

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:57.950
In other words, like the poisoning of Litvinenko, Putin either ordered it or approved it.

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:02.290
It was done on his wishes and/or with his blessing.

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:06.830
Unsurprisingly, the Kremlin denied everything.

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:12.695
They claimed it was an anti-Russian conspiracy and flatly denied any involvement.

00:11:13.918 --> 00:11:18.007
However, as the investigation progressed, more and more

00:11:18.057 --> 00:11:21.657
evidence started to emerge that was hard to explain.

00:11:22.789 --> 00:11:27.429
CCTV footage from both London and Salisbury showed the two

00:11:27.429 --> 00:11:30.259
Russian men you heard about at the start of the episode.

00:11:31.499 --> 00:11:37.889
It didn’t show exactly where they had gone, but the surveillance cameras picked them up at

00:11:37.889 --> 00:11:44.599
various locations throughout Salisbury, locations–I should add–that no normal tourist would go to.

00:11:45.699 --> 00:11:51.529
They were seen in surveillance footage in a residential area close to the nondescript

00:11:51.539 --> 00:11:57.409
suburban house that Sergey Skripal called home, and there is really no reason for any

00:11:57.409 --> 00:12:03.769
tourist to go here, especially if they have flown over from Moscow for a 48-hour trip.

00:12:05.139 --> 00:12:11.429
The British authorities identified these men as Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov.

00:12:12.369 --> 00:12:16.329
They even managed to get their mobile phone location data, which helped

00:12:16.369 --> 00:12:20.079
British authorities plot their movements when they were in the UK.

00:12:21.229 --> 00:12:25.559
If you've ever flown into London, you might have done a similar thing as these

00:12:25.559 --> 00:12:30.649
two men did: going through passport control at Gatwick airport, catching the

00:12:30.649 --> 00:12:35.999
Gatwick Express to Victoria Station, getting the tube to their hotel, then

00:12:35.999 --> 00:12:39.889
getting the tube to Waterloo station before catching a train to Salisbury.

00:12:41.369 --> 00:12:46.919
Suspiciously, however, the two men turned off their mobile phones before

00:12:46.929 --> 00:12:51.369
getting to Salisbury, only turning them back on after they had left.

00:12:52.729 --> 00:12:56.859
This was all made public information, which of course, put

00:12:56.889 --> 00:13:01.169
Moscow in a bit of a bind, a slightly tricky situation.

00:13:02.289 --> 00:13:06.019
There were two men who had been identified as Russian citizens,

00:13:06.269 --> 00:13:10.449
who were strongly suspected of having tried to kill Sergey Skripal.

00:13:11.589 --> 00:13:15.059
Now, how did this poisoning actually take place?

00:13:15.469 --> 00:13:20.839
Well, in all probability, the Novichok was placed on the door handle of Skripal’s

00:13:20.839 --> 00:13:27.529
house, and the idea was for Skripal to touch it when entering his home, die an

00:13:27.639 --> 00:13:33.159
unpleasant but quick death at home, and probably not be found for days or weeks.

00:13:33.759 --> 00:13:38.299
There would be an autopsy, but unless the authorities were specifically

00:13:38.299 --> 00:13:41.959
looking for a nerve agent like Novichok, they might well have missed it.

00:13:42.849 --> 00:13:48.479
Instead, they would have concluded that the 66-year-old Russian had died of a heart attack

00:13:48.479 --> 00:13:53.299
or a stroke, like so many other enemies of the Russian state over the past 30 years.

00:13:54.259 --> 00:14:00.089
Fortunately, his life and that of his daughter were saved, and it was clear

00:14:00.119 --> 00:14:04.799
that he hadn’t had a heart attack but had been the victim of the first

00:14:04.869 --> 00:14:10.049
state-sponsored use of a nerve agent on European soil since the Second World War.

00:14:11.179 --> 00:14:17.489
The Russian agents had failed in this mission, but there was an unfortunate casualty.

00:14:18.719 --> 00:14:22.959
Four months later, after an extensive attempt by health authorities to

00:14:22.979 --> 00:14:28.549
clean up the city, a local man found a perfume bottle in a charity bin.

00:14:30.069 --> 00:14:35.419
He had thought it was a gift, and gave it to his partner, a lady called Dawn Sturgess.

00:14:36.819 --> 00:14:42.519
Presumably thinking, “oh, how nice, what a lovely bottle”, she sprayed it on her wrists.

00:14:43.839 --> 00:14:49.069
Unbeknownst to her, this was the bottle in which the Novichok had been stored.

00:14:50.469 --> 00:14:53.229
Within hours, she became critically ill.

00:14:54.309 --> 00:15:00.289
Unlike the Skripals, who eventually recovered, Dawn Sturgess died, becoming

00:15:00.289 --> 00:15:04.969
an unintended and wholly innocent victim of this reckless operation.

00:15:06.329 --> 00:15:11.909
This was in July of 2018, and so whoever had done this, whoever

00:15:11.919 --> 00:15:16.199
had brought Novichok to Salisbury, had real blood on their hands.

00:15:17.719 --> 00:15:22.369
It was the start of a major diplomatic incident, with Theresa May again

00:15:22.649 --> 00:15:26.929
directly accusing the Kremlin, and the Kremlin denying all involvement

00:15:27.149 --> 00:15:31.099
and accusing Britain of needlessly damaging diplomatic relations.

00:15:32.179 --> 00:15:38.279
However, in September of that year, a few months after the incident, Vladimir Putin

00:15:38.689 --> 00:15:44.729
said that Russian authorities had found the potential suspects, the two men who

00:15:44.729 --> 00:15:48.959
by this time had been charged by British authorities in connection with the crime.

00:15:49.909 --> 00:15:53.909
They were civilians, Putin said, and that they would

00:15:53.939 --> 00:15:57.369
appear soon and tell their own side of the story.

00:15:58.579 --> 00:16:03.559
This sounded strange, but what followed was even stranger.

00:16:04.539 --> 00:16:09.829
There was an interview broadcast on RT, Russian state TV, with the two men

00:16:09.999 --> 00:16:14.629
who were clearly visible in the CCTV footage acting suspiciously in Salisbury.

00:16:16.179 --> 00:16:22.129
They both seemed nervous, and after admitting that, yes, they were the men

00:16:22.139 --> 00:16:26.819
in the CCTV footage, they attempted to explain their actions that weekend.

00:16:28.129 --> 00:16:33.509
They said that a friend had recommended them to go to Salisbury, but the more they

00:16:33.509 --> 00:16:39.009
talked, shifting nervously in their seats, the more surreal the “interview” became.

00:16:40.439 --> 00:16:46.049
The men were clearly very uncomfortable, and their answers were peppered with

00:16:46.059 --> 00:16:51.819
bizarre details like the exact height of Salisbury Cathedral’s spire as if

00:16:52.049 --> 00:16:57.019
they’d crammed for a geography quiz rather than rehearsed a believable alibi.

00:16:58.389 --> 00:17:04.909
The interviewer then asked them if they worked for GRU, the Russian military intelligence agency.

00:17:05.909 --> 00:17:06.959
The men denied it.

00:17:07.869 --> 00:17:13.709
When asked what they did for a job, if not the GRU, one responded, “if

00:17:13.709 --> 00:17:17.409
we tell you about our business, people we work with will be affected”.

00:17:18.939 --> 00:17:25.219
And when pressed, he responded, “to cut a long story short, we’re in the fitness industry”.

00:17:26.569 --> 00:17:32.209
Now, it’s not completely clear who the intended audience of this interview was.

00:17:33.069 --> 00:17:37.619
If it was for an international audience, it certainly didn’t work.

00:17:38.469 --> 00:17:44.289
Not only was it very hard to believe their story, but it also gave internet

00:17:44.299 --> 00:17:48.639
sleuths, armchair detectives, another very useful piece of evidence.

00:17:50.109 --> 00:17:55.129
The men had identified themselves as Ruslan Boshirov and Alexander

00:17:55.129 --> 00:18:00.799
Petrov, but the authorities were fairly sure these were fake identities.

00:18:02.179 --> 00:18:08.349
Using a mixture of data from birth records, passport data, and early photographs, the

00:18:08.359 --> 00:18:13.759
investigative journalism outlet Bellingcat revealed the true identities of the pair.

00:18:14.929 --> 00:18:21.399
Their names were Alexander Mishkin and Anatoliy Chepiga, and they were, surprise,

00:18:21.409 --> 00:18:27.205
surprise, GRU agents, agents of the Russian military intelligence agency.

00:18:28.395 --> 00:18:33.795
They were clearly much better military operatives than they were actors, because they were

00:18:33.795 --> 00:18:40.005
highly decorated members of the Russian military, and there was even a photograph of Mishkin

00:18:40.365 --> 00:18:46.735
shaking Putin’s hand after being awarded a “hero of the Russian Federation” medal in 2014.

00:18:48.475 --> 00:18:54.285
Given all of this, now it was practically impossible to deny state involvement.

00:18:55.255 --> 00:19:00.195
The men who almost certainly administered the novichok were agents of the

00:19:00.195 --> 00:19:05.575
Russian state, and Theresa May, the British Prime Minister, told Parliament

00:19:05.625 --> 00:19:12.315
that “the conspiracy must have been approved at a senior level outside the GRU.”

00:19:13.735 --> 00:19:19.395
This could only mean one thing: the go-ahead came from Vladimir Putin himself.

00:19:20.385 --> 00:19:22.455
But what was actually going to happen?

00:19:23.045 --> 00:19:29.375
Well, on one level, the international fallout from the Salisbury poisoning was significant.

00:19:29.905 --> 00:19:36.056
The UK expelled 23 Russian diplomats, whom  it identified as undeclared intelligence officers.

00:19:36.726 --> 00:19:41.256
In response, Russia expelled the same number of British diplomats.

00:19:41.886 --> 00:19:47.056
Western allies, including the United States and various countries in Europe, imposed

00:19:47.066 --> 00:19:51.746
further sanctions on Russia, deepening its isolation from the international community.

00:19:52.766 --> 00:19:56.866
But, this was really not much more than a slap on the wrist.

00:19:57.676 --> 00:20:02.996
Domestically, it appears that this incident did not harm Putin in the slightest.

00:20:04.176 --> 00:20:09.546
He had just won re-election with 76% of the public vote, and there were

00:20:09.566 --> 00:20:13.976
all sorts of conspiracy theories being touted in Russia suggesting that

00:20:14.226 --> 00:20:18.376
British authorities had killed Skripal in an attempt to damage Russia.

00:20:19.406 --> 00:20:24.436
Even the Russian ambassador to the UK hinted at his disbelief in the official

00:20:24.446 --> 00:20:29.486
verdict, saying that he hadn’t seen any proof that Skripal was even in hospital.

00:20:31.016 --> 00:20:38.106
And domestically, no, Putin hadn’t managed to kill Skripal, but he had sent yet another powerful

00:20:38.106 --> 00:20:43.556
message, just in case people hadn’t been paying attention to the dozens of opponents who

00:20:43.556 --> 00:20:50.006
had had mysterious plane crashes, heart attacks or had “tripped” near a fifth-floor window.

00:20:50.686 --> 00:20:55.156
There are no lengths he will not go to to silence an enemy, no matter

00:20:55.156 --> 00:20:59.756
where they are in the world and even if they are living a quiet and

00:20:59.756 --> 00:21:04.056
non-confrontational life, as Sergey Skripal is believed to have been.

00:21:04.956 --> 00:21:10.926
Now, to wrap things up, the Salisbury poisoning remains one of the most brazen and shocking

00:21:10.946 --> 00:21:16.776
acts of state-sponsored aggression in modern history, and certainly in modern British history.

00:21:17.756 --> 00:21:22.516
It was a calculated move, one designed not just to eliminate a perceived

00:21:22.546 --> 00:21:27.906
traitor, but to send a message to anyone considering betraying the Russian state.

00:21:28.856 --> 00:21:34.786
For Vladimir Putin, the message was simple: no one is beyond his reach.

00:21:36.906 --> 00:21:42.566
OK then, that is it for today's episode on the attempted murder of Sergey Skripal,

00:21:42.756 --> 00:21:47.756
and with that comes an end to this poison-themed mini-series on Vladimir Putin.

00:21:48.376 --> 00:21:51.626
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:21:52.376 --> 00:21:56.266
Again, to state the absolutely blindingly obvious, there is so

00:21:56.266 --> 00:21:59.806
much more to this story and to the rise and rule of Vladimir Putin.

00:22:00.226 --> 00:22:04.846
I decided to go heavily with the poison angle because these stories are a reminder

00:22:04.986 --> 00:22:10.976
of the absolute power Putin wields, how vengeful he clearly is, and how bold and

00:22:10.976 --> 00:22:15.636
shameless he has become in his attempt to silence anyone who goes against him.

00:22:16.966 --> 00:22:21.426
