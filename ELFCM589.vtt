Hello, hello, hello, and welcome

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.950
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.759
Minds, by Leonardo English, the show

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:14.540
where you can listen to fascinating

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.100
stories and learn weird and wonderful

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:19.190
things about the world at the same

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:21.040
time as improving your English.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.680
I'm Alastair Budge, and today it’s part

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.159
three of our three-part mini-series on

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.580
the loose theme of words and language.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.690
In case you missed them, part

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.999
one was on words of the year,

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:38.980
and part two was on euphemisms.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.370
Today, we’re talking about

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.300
something different altogether.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.489
We’re going to be focusing on

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.458
the word “enshittification”.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.589
It was coined in 2022 and was named Word

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:55.559
of the Year by various dictionaries for

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.660
its perfect capture of a cultural moment.

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.660
So in this episode, we’ll talk about

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.870
the word, what it means, why it matters,

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.230
and I’ll share a recent personal

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.090
experience that I think is a perfect

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:13.430
example of real-world enshittification.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.669
OK then, let’s not waste a

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.240
minute and get right into it.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.470
One of the best things, I think,

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.880
about learning different languages

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.559
is that it gives you an appreciation

00:01:28.949 --> 00:01:31.590
for the sound of different words

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.370
to describe the same thing.

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.350
For example, in English, we say “child”

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.960
or “children” to describe a young person.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.560
It’s a perfectly good word, and if

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.069
you only spoke English, you probably

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.520
wouldn’t think twice about it.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.200
But I think several other languages

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.989
better capture the essence of being a

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.310
child, Bambino” in Italian is one example.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.830
Or “niño” in Spanish. Even “barn” in

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.370
Swedish, if you ask me, does a better job.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.760
It sounds more like “child”

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.870
than the English word “child”.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.400
It is, of course, simply personal

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.950
preference; perhaps you think the

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.374
word “child” sounds more appropriate

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.740
than whatever it is in your language.

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.330
And when you learn another language, you

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.140
realise that there are some words that

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.980
don’t have a perfect translation, a word

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.480
or expression with a meaning you can

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.750
understand, but a translation that misses

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.380
some of the nuance, the implicit meaning.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.800
But sometimes, putting language

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.513
learning aside for a minute, there

00:02:53.513 --> 00:02:55.430
is a word that comes along that

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.310
perfectly encapsulates something

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.020
that had never previously been named.

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.782
One example of this is “enshittification”.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.940
It was coined in 2022 by a Canadian

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.410
journalist called Cory Doctorow,

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.050
and it touched such a nerve that it

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.800
was made the word of the year by the

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.360
American Dialect Society in 2023, then

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.840
by Australia’s Macquarie Dictionary

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.170
the next year, and it went on to

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.230
be added to both Dictionary.com and

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.300
Merriam-Webster’s lists of English words.

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.430
Before I tell you what it means, let’s try

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.360
to break it down and see if we can guess.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.937
So, it’s en - E N - shit - ification.

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.370
There are three component

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.986
parts: en, shit, and ification.

00:03:57.276 --> 00:04:01.640
En, E-N, is a prefix that is often related

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.140
to process or action, of changing state.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.780
Enrich means to become rich.

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.750
Entrap means to become trapped.

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.510
Enlarge means to become larger.

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.195
If there’s an “en” at the start of

00:04:19.345 --> 00:04:21.837
the word, then an adjective or a

00:04:21.837 --> 00:04:24.380
verb, there’s a good chance that

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:27.480
this word means to become that thing.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.700
Then “ification” at the end of the

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.130
word, as a suffix, has a similar

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.680
function, but it means “the process

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.590
of making or becoming something”.

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.130
And importantly, it turns

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.210
the word into a noun.

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:51.030
So, simplification is the process of

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.240
making something simple, clarification

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.800
is the process of making something

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.100
clear, and notification is the process

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.540
of notifying someone about something.

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.460
Then the word in the middle is perhaps

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.840
not so high-brow, not so formal.

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.040
It’s “shit”, an informal

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.090
and rude word for bad.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.180
Now, you will probably know that I

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.900
don’t tend to talk about swear words

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.590
on this show, but as we are talking

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.450
about “enshittiification”, I do need

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.650
to spend a little more time talking

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.900
about what “shit” really means.

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.270
On the scale of swear words in British

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.620
English, it’s far from the worst,

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.450
and although you shouldn’t say it in

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.400
any kind of formal or professional

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:48.120
context, it’s not deeply offensive.

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:52.140
As an adjective, it means “bad”,

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.740
but it also sometimes has this

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.770
connotation of being frustratingly

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:02.130
and unnecessarily low quality.

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:07.250
So, “enshittification”, if we were to use

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.090
our linguistic Sherlock Holmes detective

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:13.970
skills, might be defined as the process

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.770
of something becoming increasingly

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.190
shit and frustratingly low quality.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.984
When it was coined back in 2022,

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:27.650
it was in reference to social media

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.120
and sites such as Facebook and

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.960
Twitter, as it was known back then.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.830
And here was the theory, as

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:37.757
set out by Cory Doctorow:

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.790
First, a platform starts

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:43.130
out as pretty good.

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:47.200
It’s useful, it’s free, and it genuinely

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.640
works in the interest of its users.

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:51.620
People like it, they tell their

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.930
friends, and the platform grows.

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:57.940
Then, in order to attract businesses,

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.720
the platform shifts slightly.

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:02.590
It starts prioritising

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.140
things that make money.

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.040
Maybe showing a few ads here,

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:08.680
tweaking an algorithm there.

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:12.140
It’s not terrible, but the experience

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:14.540
is no longer quite as good as it was.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.230
Finally, once the user base is

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.670
locked in and the businesses are

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:23.610
too, the platform shifts again.

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:27.710
This time, it turns hostile to both.

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:31.110
It bombards users with low-quality

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:33.890
content, pushes ads in every

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:36.080
possible corner, and quietly

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:38.250
removes useful features.

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:41.620
Businesses are forced to pay more

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:45.040
to get less, and the value starts

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:47.240
flowing to the shareholders.

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:50.690
The platform has become worse for

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:53.400
everyone, but it’s more profitable,

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:54.930
at least in the short term.

00:07:55.597 --> 00:07:57.570
That, Doctorow argued,

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.270
is enshittification.

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:03.420
A slow, deliberate transformation from

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:05.830
something that people love… to something

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:08.680
that they can’t stand, but can’t escape.

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:11.840
The primary example he used,

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:14.610
and one which I imagine you will

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:16.830
be familiar with, is Facebook.

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.660
It started out as a site exclusively

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:23.530
for Harvard students, then you needed

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:25.120
to have a university email address,

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:27.450
and then it was open to anyone.

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:30.530
I remember those early days.

00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:33.800
One of my friends from school started

00:08:33.810 --> 00:08:36.840
university before I did, so in the

00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:40.920
autumn of 2005, he was able to get

00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:43.300
a Facebook account, and I wasn’t.

00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:47.460
It seemed like magic; real profiles,

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:50.250
no adverts, just authentic,

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:52.600
unfiltered connections with

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.950
friends and people you really knew.

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:58.620
Then businesses were encouraged to

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:00.890
create Facebook pages, whether that

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:02.180
was your friendly neighbourhood

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:04.510
coffee shop or the BBC News.

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:08.000
Facebook was already where everyone was

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.190
spending their time, so by creating a

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:13.300
Facebook page and encouraging people

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:17.060
to “follow” you, this was a new and

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:19.990
free way to connect with your audience.

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:22.710
Perhaps this wasn’t so

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:24.870
great for individual users.

00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:28.700
After all, people weren’t really opening

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:30.860
up Facebook to see a link to a news

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:34.240
story or a poster about a special deal on

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:36.920
coffee; they wanted to see their friends.

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:39.570
But it was kind of ok.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:43.070
Then Facebook started encouraging

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:44.740
advertisers onto the platform.

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:46.480
We have all these people.

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:48.350
We know all of this stuff about them.

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:51.050
If you pay us a small amount of

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:53.240
money, you can advertise to them.

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:57.260
Again, this wasn’t terrible, but it wasn’t

00:09:57.310 --> 00:09:59.350
exactly what people had signed up for.

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:02.090
Mark Zuckerberg had initially

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:03.400
said this wouldn’t happen.

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:06.880
And then the same thing happened to

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:08.830
the businesses that had spent time

00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:10.150
and resources in building up their

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:13.130
Facebook pages; Facebook now turned

00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:15.840
around and said, “well, if you want your

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.870
followers to see your posts, you need

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:19.940
to pay us to make sure that happens”.

00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:23.110
Again, a bit annoying for these

00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:25.430
businesses, but they had put a lot of

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:28.000
time and effort into their Facebook pages.

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.670
It seemed like an overreaction

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:33.080
to walk away now simply because

00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:34.360
Facebook wanted some money.

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:37.230
Then it got more expensive for

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:39.270
businesses to advertise, Facebook

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:41.770
started cramming more and more adverts,

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:43.947
the same thing happened on Instagram,

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:47.370
and slowly but surely, the experience

00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:50.460
has degraded so much from its early

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:53.260
iteration that it’s hardly recognisable.

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:56.540
Still, there hasn’t been a mass

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:59.420
exodus on either side, neither

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:02.220
by the users nor the businesses.

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:06.340
Yes, user growth is down, and

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:08.420
many users have left entirely.

00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:12.450
But there are still over 3 billion

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:15.970
monthly active users, 37% of

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:17.850
the global adult population.

00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:20.610
People have invested too much,

00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:22.780
Doctorow argued; their photos,

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:25.020
friends, and connections are all

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:28.040
there, and although the experience has

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:30.760
significantly degraded, they don’t leave.

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:34.280
And the final element is to do

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:36.950
with corporate value capture; all

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:39.340
the value from the platform has

00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:42.230
flowed to shareholders, turning

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:45.350
Meta–Facebook’s parent company–into

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:47.760
a trillion-dollar business.

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:50.850
It happened with Facebook and Instagram,

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:54.040
and has also happened with many other

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:56.700
social media sites, from Twitter through

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:59.400
to Pinterest, Reddit, and TikTok.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:03.420
And this is enshittification; the

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:06.650
gradual process of social media networks

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:09.870
becoming worse and worse, or shitter

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:12.560
and shitter, all while extracting the

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:15.240
maximum possible value from their users.

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:20.700
And no sooner had Doctorow coined and

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:23.900
explained the term than it began to change

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:26.230
shape, and people started pointing out

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:29.360
enshittification in every aspect of life.

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:32.900
Now, this wasn’t just your classic

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:35.110
people saying “things were better back

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:38.440
in my day”, but real-life examples of

00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:42.150
how we are often asked to pay more for

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:44.720
something that is lower in quality.

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:47.820
Whether that was video games forcing

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:49.740
people to spend money on all sorts

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:52.813
of in-game upsells, Disney Plus or

00:12:52.813 --> 00:12:55.430
Netflix doubling their prices for

00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:58.280
less content, or showing adverts even

00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:00.510
when you pay for it, or just your

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:02.840
favourite chocolate bar getting smaller

00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:05.460
and more expensive at the same time.

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:09.020
Even Duolingo has been accused

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:11.390
of enshittification by getting

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:13.460
rid of its forum, switching its

00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:15.910
gamification system and stuffing

00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:18.040
its free version with more ads.

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:21.530
And it’s something that’s not restricted

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:24.030
to the digital world, either; it’s

00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:26.530
something you can see almost everywhere.

00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:28.870
I was reminded of this

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:30.960
late last year in the UK.

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:33.310
I was visiting my parents

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:35.010
with my two young kids.

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:38.100
My mother suggested that we go to a

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:41.570
sort of farm centre, which she had heard

00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:44.590
had a nice little shop, a playground,

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:47.370
some animals, and a place where kids

00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:49.540
could pick pumpkins for Halloween.

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:52.060
It sounded great in

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:53.990
theory, so off we went.

00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:56.630
It wasn’t a particularly nice

00:13:56.630 --> 00:13:59.460
day weather-wise, but it was

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:01.300
the end of October in England.

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:03.110
A bit of wind and rain

00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:04.510
comes with the territory.

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:07.690
We arrived, and everything

00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:09.200
seemed perfectly acceptable.

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:11.620
We had an unremarkable coffee

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:13.950
and snack at the cafe to warm up,

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.080
then headed towards the animals.

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:18.910
To get towards the animals, you had

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:21.560
to walk through a little fairground,

00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:24.400
a little bit like how airports often

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:26.420
force you to walk through the Duty

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:28.460
Free section to get to your gate.

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:31.480
Slightly annoying, but there we go.

00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:34.270
We arrived at the animal bit.

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:37.120
There were a couple of sad-looking

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:40.510
donkeys, two pigs, and that was about it.

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:43.700
Obviously, my kids wanted to go to

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:45.670
the fairground, because we had been

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:48.390
forced to walk through it, and I

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:50.130
agreed they could do one thing of

00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:52.700
their choosing: one ride, or activity.

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:56.220
They chose the merry-go-round, the

00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:57.790
ride where there are all of the

00:14:57.790 --> 00:15:00.020
horses and carriages that move around

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:02.590
on a disk, with music and stuff.

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:07.040
As we approached the merry-go-round, I

00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:09.690
had seen groups of people go up to the

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:12.950
cashier's desk and walk away seemingly

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:15.600
in disgust, which didn’t bode well,

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:18.320
but I figured I’d promised my kids

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:21.220
they could go, so how bad could it be?

00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:23.900
It was only about 11 o’clock in

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:26.270
the morning, but the man behind

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:28.230
the desk looked like he’d been

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:30.500
arguing with customers for hours.

00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:35.300
The price was £3 per child, but

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:37.410
because one of my children was under

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:39.930
1 metre tall, I’d have to come on

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:42.174
with him and buy my own ticket.

00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:44.914
£9 in total.

00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:46.750
A little over €10.

00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:51.350
Now, the ride itself was perfectly ok.

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:54.480
It was a bit sad and old, the music was

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:57.120
a bit squeaky, and the horses looked

00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:59.060
like they needed a lick of paint.

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:01.960
Still, my kids liked it, which I

00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:03.570
guess is the most important thing.

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:06.870
The thing was, by the looks of how

00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:09.060
many people had walked up to the

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:12.000
merry-go-round and not gone on, or were

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.440
standing around watching, presumably

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:17.100
put off by the high price, it seemed

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:19.110
to me like they could have reduced

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:22.180
their prices significantly and had many

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:24.400
more kids on the ride, and actually

00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:27.580
made more money overall, but instead

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:30.360
they extracted as much value as they

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:32.640
possibly could from each paying customer,

00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:35.210
extremely begrudgingly I must add.

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:38.610
And if you think this was an

00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:41.090
isolated incident, it wasn’t.

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:43.940
There was a marshmallow barbecue,

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:46.560
which was a nice enough idea, but

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:48.720
nobody was there, because they were

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:52.240
charging £5 for a stick of what looked

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:54.880
like around 5 small marshmallows.

00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:57.560
There was a “throw a hoop around the

00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:00.211
rubber duck” game, but nobody was there,

00:17:00.586 --> 00:17:03.030
because it was £4 for a single throw.

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:06.080
There were, we found out later,

00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:08.290
more animals than the pair of

00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:10.480
donkeys, but these were kept in

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:13.160
another part, and it was another

00:17:13.484 --> 00:17:16.730
£13 per person, I think, to go in.

00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:20.130
And looking at the online reviews,

00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:22.480
most people seemed to be pretty

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:24.340
disappointed with the experience.

00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:28.290
We decided against it and asked

00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:30.250
the lady selling tickets how to get

00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:32.710
back to the car park, to which she

00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:35.050
responded that she didn’t know because

00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:36.940
the part she worked in was actually

00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:39.250
operated by a different company, so

00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:40.730
she didn’t have anything to do with it.

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:44.070
Now, you might think that

00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:45.830
this is just a complaint about

00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:48.210
paying for stuff; it isn’t.

00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:50.500
I appreciate that running a

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:52.290
business like this must be tough.

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:55.630
You have to pay staff, rent, look after

00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:57.890
the animals, and all this costs money.

00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:01.270
And comparing costs to those of my

00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:03.800
childhood isn’t helpful, because

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:05.570
everything has got significantly

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:07.190
more expensive since then.

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:10.930
But why I bring up this experience

00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:13.150
in the context of enshittification

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:16.677
is that, for me, it encapsulates

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:19.080
offline enshittification.

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.580
This animal farm had put up

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:24.400
adverts all over the Oxford

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:26.410
area, bringing people to it.

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:28.880
Once they got there, they didn’t

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:30.420
want to just turn around and go

00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:33.670
home, but they begrudgingly stayed,

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:36.430
paying the inflated prices for a

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:39.160
lower-than-expected quality of experience.

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:42.214
Every possible corner had been cut,

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:45.500
and every possible activity cost extra.

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:49.350
And the thing was that it

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:50.660
doesn’t have to be that way.

00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:54.670
Just a few days before this, my family

00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:57.490
and I had gone to a theme park in Sweden.

00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:01.360
The entry price was relatively high, but

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:04.920
once you got in, it seemed like no expense

00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:08.010
had been spared; there were real pumpkins

00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:10.990
piled up high, lots of smiling staff,

00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:14.360
free shows, all this stuff that made

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:16.020
you think that they were really trying

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:17.890
to put on a good experience for you.

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:21.000
And this isn’t just a

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.300
question of Sweden vs.

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:25.610
the UK; there is another really good

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:28.070
animal park we’d been to with my kids a

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:30.230
couple of years before, quite close to

00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:33.090
this other one in England, which hadn’t

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:35.947
yet been subject to enshittification.

00:19:36.544 --> 00:19:39.040
But it is an increasing trend,

00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:42.270
especially in the UK, and once you

00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:44.200
notice it, you see it everywhere.

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:48.870
So, there we go, enshittification, a word

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:51.710
I think perfectly captures the essence

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:54.260
of something we can see all around us.

00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:57.860
And going back to what we talked about

00:19:57.890 --> 00:20:00.200
at the start of the episode, I looked

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:02.860
into how the term “enshittificaiton”

00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:05.370
is translated into different languages.

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:08.730
Most seem to keep the English

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:11.310
version, while others do a direct

00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:12.850
translation from the English,

00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:15.540
like “Merdification” in French.

00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:18.340
This just goes to show that

00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:20.530
sometimes there is an expression

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:23.040
that is just so perfectly accurate

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:26.200
it can never really be translated.

00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:30.340
OK, then, that is it for today's episode

00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:32.930
on enshittification, and with that comes

00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:35.134
the end of this three-part mini-series

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:38.200
on the theme of words and language.

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:40.290
In case you missed them, in part

00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:42.420
one, we talked about words of the

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:44.510
year, and in part two we talked

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:46.000
about euphemisms in English.

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:47.920
As always, I’d love to

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:48.850
know what you think.

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:50.990
Do you see examples of

00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:52.770
enshittification in your country?

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:54.900
Have you had an experience of

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:56.757
enshittification in the UK?

00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:59.430
And what can we do to fix it?

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:01.630
I would love to know, so let’s

00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:02.970
get this discussion started.

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:04.290
You can head right into our

00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:05.930
community forum, which is at

00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:08.700
community.leonardoenglish.com and get

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:11.040
chatting away to other curious minds.

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:13.510
You've been listening to English Learning

00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:16.250

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:19.400

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:21.460
