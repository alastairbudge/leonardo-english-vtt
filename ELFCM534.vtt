Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.630
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories and learn weird and

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.820
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.389 --> 00:00:28.900
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is part two of our mini-series on the theme of “scientific discovery”.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.950
In part one, we talked about the invention of the leap year

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.700
and ideas throughout history about how to manage our calendars.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.038
Next up, in part three, we’ll talk about maths and some of the unusual

00:00:43.038 --> 00:00:47.468
and surprising ways in which mathematical discoveries changed the world.

00:00:48.048 --> 00:00:55.273
And in today’s episode, part two, we are going to talk about the discovery of the structure of DNA.

00:00:55.868 --> 00:01:02.000
It is a fantastic story of perseverance, luck, sexism, betrayal, and a

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.860
quest to solve one of life’s most important and fundamental questions.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.290
So, let’s not waste a minute and get right into it.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.650
The House of Habsburg was one of the most longstanding and powerful European noble families.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:26.140
Starting in the 11th century in modern-day Austria, the family went to

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:32.310
rule over modern-day Hungary, Croatia, Portugal, Spain, much of Italy, and,

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.290
lest I forget, the position of Holy Roman Emperor for a whopping 300 years.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.200
This great expansion of power did not come about

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.820
primarily through military conquest but through marriage.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:54.940
Daughters and sons were married off to other European royalty, and by the 15th

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.530
century or so, Habsburgs could be found in almost every major European royal court.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.770
And, being a royal family, fathers were unwilling to let their children marry

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.390
anyone of a lower social rank, which inevitably meant that young princes and

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:21.000
princesses would end up marrying their cousins, some more and some less distant.

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.886
This led to a curious phenomenon in the royal houses of Europe:

00:02:27.076 --> 00:02:31.886
the Habsburg jaw, or the Habsburg lip, as it’s sometimes known.

00:02:33.116 --> 00:02:38.536
Essentially, it is a condition where the lower jaw is significantly

00:02:38.546 --> 00:02:44.556
longer, and it sticks out, the lower lip is often enlarged, and there is

00:02:44.556 --> 00:02:49.756
a crossbite, where the lower teeth are further out than the upper teeth.

00:02:51.246 --> 00:02:55.625
It is a phenomenon that is clearly visible in the portraits of many of

00:02:55.625 --> 00:03:00.775
the Habsburg family members, perhaps most famously Charles II of Spain.

00:03:01.818 --> 00:03:06.374
In fact, most commentators believe that their jaws would actually have been

00:03:06.374 --> 00:03:11.814
far more enlarged than the official portraits because the artist would have

00:03:11.814 --> 00:03:16.854
wanted to flatter them, to make them seem less prominent than they really were.

00:03:18.144 --> 00:03:24.894
Such phenomena are common when there are high levels of interbreeding, where people who are closely

00:03:24.894 --> 00:03:31.344
related have children, and certain characteristics become particularly pronounced in these children.

00:03:32.654 --> 00:03:36.144
Of course, the fact that children typically share some

00:03:36.164 --> 00:03:40.154
similarities with their parents is no “new” discovery.

00:03:40.964 --> 00:03:46.264
For as long as humans have existed and have reproduced, it has been clear that

00:03:46.264 --> 00:03:52.545
something is passed from parent to child, and whatever this is, it can govern

00:03:52.585 --> 00:03:57.095
everything from the colour of their hair to the colour of their skin to the

00:03:57.095 --> 00:04:03.225
shape of their face to non-physical traits, like temperament or intelligence.

00:04:04.095 --> 00:04:07.315
You probably look a little bit like your parents.

00:04:07.805 --> 00:04:11.085
If you have children, they probably look a bit like you.

00:04:11.985 --> 00:04:16.535
Clearly, some information is passed from parent to child.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:25.635
But for most of human history, no one really knew how this “information” was passed down.

00:04:26.245 --> 00:04:27.705
What was the mechanism?

00:04:28.155 --> 00:04:33.635
What was it that parents gave to their children that determined these traits?

00:04:33.815 --> 00:04:35.775
Where was this information stored?

00:04:36.506 --> 00:04:42.950
And what explained how children weren’t an exact replica of their parents?

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:48.570
Why were some characteristics passed from parent to child and others weren’t?

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.460
These questions puzzled scientists and philosophers for centuries.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.400
Some thought it was related to blood—hence the term “bloodline.”

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:08.000
Others believed in a mystical “essence” that passed from one generation to the next.

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:15.000
But no one had any concrete evidence to explain the biological process.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:24.390
Fast forward to the 19th century, and a series of discoveries started to shed light on this mystery.

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:32.790
It began with a monk named Gregor Mendel, a German man often called the father of genetics.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:42.380
Mendel’s experiments with pea plants in the 1850s and 1860s revealed that traits like flower

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:49.260
colour or seed shape followed predictable patterns when passed from one generation to another.

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:56.810
For example, if a purebred yellow pea plant reproduced with a purebred

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:02.017
green pea plant, it would produce yellow, not green pea plants.

00:06:02.487 --> 00:06:07.407
But in subsequent generations, green pea plants could still

00:06:07.407 --> 00:06:11.517
appear, even if the plants they came from were both yellow.

00:06:12.367 --> 00:06:20.187
It was unlikely, only occurring in a ratio of 1 green to 3 yellow, but the green

00:06:20.627 --> 00:06:27.347
“characteristic”, whatever it was, it didn’t disappear completely; it was still there, somewhere.

00:06:28.112 --> 00:06:33.256
If this is bringing back memories of high school biology class, yes, this is

00:06:33.266 --> 00:06:39.066
because yellow is dominant, and green is recessive, in pea plants at least.

00:06:39.976 --> 00:06:43.956
He didn’t know it at the time, but Mendel was describing

00:06:44.176 --> 00:06:49.116
how genes worked—units of information that control traits.

00:06:49.952 --> 00:06:53.432
But where were these “genes” located?

00:06:54.678 --> 00:07:00.722
Mendel’s work didn’t answer that question, and for decades, it was largely ignored.

00:07:01.972 --> 00:07:08.292
It wasn’t until 1869 that a Swiss scientist named Friedrich Miescher made

00:07:08.292 --> 00:07:13.292
an accidental discovery that would eventually help answer this question.

00:07:14.412 --> 00:07:20.892
While studying white blood cells, he found a strange substance inside their nuclei.

00:07:21.832 --> 00:07:27.581
He called it “nuclein,” and it was what we now know as DNA.

00:07:28.742 --> 00:07:34.253
Yet, at the time, no one knew what this mysterious substance did.

00:07:35.313 --> 00:07:42.183
Most scientists believed it was just some kind of cellular waste, and indeed, towards the

00:07:42.193 --> 00:07:48.523
end of his life, Miescher rejected the possibility that this nuclein had anything to do

00:07:48.523 --> 00:07:55.153
with genes, saying that it was, and I’m quoting directly, “irrelevant to inheritance”.

00:07:55.903 --> 00:08:01.733
So, while scientists had started to gather clues about heredity—traits

00:08:01.983 --> 00:08:07.033
passed from parent to child—they were still none the wiser about the details.

00:08:07.683 --> 00:08:12.843
What exactly carried this genetic information, and how did it work?

00:08:13.983 --> 00:08:17.553
Now, let’s jump to the early 20th century.

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:24.341
By this time, scientists knew that cells had a nucleus, and they suspected

00:08:24.521 --> 00:08:29.951
that the nucleus contained something important for heredity, for inheritance.

00:08:30.681 --> 00:08:34.791
But what that “something” was remained a mystery.

00:08:35.901 --> 00:08:40.491
In the early 1900s, scientists discovered that chromosomes,

00:08:40.831 --> 00:08:44.981
thread-like structures in the nucleus, played a role in heredity.

00:08:45.731 --> 00:08:52.443
They noticed that chromosomes seemed to divide and duplicate when cells reproduced,

00:08:52.769 --> 00:08:58.277
and they thought chromosomes might carry the mysterious hereditary material.

00:08:59.007 --> 00:09:03.497
Chromosomes, as scientists observed, are made up of

00:09:03.587 --> 00:09:09.317
two main substances: proteins and something called DNA.

00:09:10.757 --> 00:09:14.677
At the time, most scientists believed that proteins,

00:09:14.887 --> 00:09:18.627
not DNA, were where this genetic information was stored.

00:09:19.767 --> 00:09:24.877
Proteins, with 20 different amino acids, seemed more

00:09:24.917 --> 00:09:28.017
complex and more capable of storing information.

00:09:28.917 --> 00:09:36.058
And DNA appeared quite simple—just a repetitive chain of four chemical bases.

00:09:37.398 --> 00:09:42.838
Perhaps perfectly reasonably, given the complexity of life, of all of the

00:09:42.838 --> 00:09:48.158
information that is required to reproduce another human, passing down characteristics

00:09:48.158 --> 00:09:53.428
from parent to child, most scientists believed that this genetic information

00:09:53.628 --> 00:09:59.541
was held in the more complicated-looking substance–proteins–not in DNA.

00:10:00.488 --> 00:10:03.466
But, as you will know, they were wrong.

00:10:04.566 --> 00:10:08.886
The first major clue that DNA was the molecule of

00:10:08.886 --> 00:10:13.257
heredity came from a series of experiments in the 1940s.

00:10:14.267 --> 00:10:21.357
In 1944, a team of scientists led by a man named Oswald Avery performed an

00:10:21.407 --> 00:10:26.757
experiment that showed that DNA, not proteins, carried genetic information.

00:10:28.047 --> 00:10:36.200
Avery and his colleagues studied bacteria that caused pneumonia, and they demonstrated that DNA from

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:43.370
one type of bacteria could change, or “transform,” another type into something completely different.

00:10:44.539 --> 00:10:50.181
This was revolutionary, but many scientists were still sceptical.

00:10:51.041 --> 00:10:56.061
It seemed too strange that such a simple molecule could carry the

00:10:56.071 --> 00:10:59.931
vast amount of information needed to create a living organism.

00:11:01.251 --> 00:11:06.101
By the early 1950s, the scientific community had started to come to a

00:11:06.131 --> 00:11:11.981
consensus that DNA was important, but still no one understood its structure.

00:11:12.721 --> 00:11:18.971
If scientists could figure out the shape of DNA, they believed they could unlock the

00:11:18.971 --> 00:11:26.554
secret of how it worked and, therefore, truly understand the blueprint to human life.

00:11:27.484 --> 00:11:33.024
This sparked fierce competition among scientists to solve the puzzle.

00:11:33.832 --> 00:11:38.085
And this is where the story takes a more dramatic turn.

00:11:38.635 --> 00:11:43.865
At King’s College in London, a brilliant scientist named Rosalind Franklin

00:11:44.145 --> 00:11:49.649
was using a cutting-edge technique called X-ray crystallography to study DNA.

00:11:50.665 --> 00:11:55.395
This method involved shining X-rays at a crystal of DNA

00:11:55.785 --> 00:11:59.415
and analyzing the pattern of how the rays scattered.

00:12:00.925 --> 00:12:06.405
Franklin’s work was meticulous, and she produced the clearest images of

00:12:06.405 --> 00:12:13.245
DNA ever seen, including one particularly famous image known as Photo 51.

00:12:14.355 --> 00:12:21.885
Photo 51 was groundbreaking because, although it didn’t show the complete structure, it provided

00:12:21.955 --> 00:12:30.544
clear evidence that DNA had a helical structure, like a twisty snake or a spiral staircase.

00:12:31.824 --> 00:12:36.074
The X-ray diffraction pattern showed repeating features that

00:12:36.074 --> 00:12:40.209
hinted at the molecule’s shape and its internal symmetry.

00:12:41.264 --> 00:12:48.994
This was an invaluable clue to determine not only what DNA looked like but also how it functioned.

00:12:50.184 --> 00:12:56.484
But Franklin wasn’t the only scientist at King’s College trying to unravel DNA’s mysteries.

00:12:57.394 --> 00:13:01.314
Another researcher there, Maurice Wilkins, was taking a rather

00:13:01.384 --> 00:13:05.914
different approach—and the two of them never truly hit it off.

00:13:06.924 --> 00:13:13.894
Part of the problem was a muddled start: the lab director hired Franklin while Wilkins was

00:13:13.894 --> 00:13:20.754
away on holiday and led her to believe that she would be the sole researcher focusing on DNA.

00:13:21.791 --> 00:13:25.591
When Wilkins returned, he assumed Franklin was a new

00:13:25.591 --> 00:13:28.781
assistant rather than a colleague on equal footing.

00:13:29.661 --> 00:13:33.361
She, in turn, resented that someone else was working

00:13:33.361 --> 00:13:36.831
on what she understood to be her exclusive project.

00:13:38.101 --> 00:13:41.861
From that point on, collaboration was replaced by

00:13:41.901 --> 00:13:46.521
competition, and the atmosphere between them remained tense.

00:13:47.821 --> 00:13:53.121
Despite their frosty relationship, they were both making important strides.

00:13:53.871 --> 00:13:58.131
Franklin continued to refine her X-ray crystallography techniques,

00:13:58.411 --> 00:14:03.431
while Wilkins pursued alternative methods for studying DNA’s structure.

00:14:04.541 --> 00:14:10.371
Had they worked together more smoothly, perhaps the story would have unfolded differently.

00:14:11.561 --> 00:14:17.861
Instead, a crucial piece of Franklin’s data would soon find its way into the hands of two

00:14:17.861 --> 00:14:23.841
men at Cambridge, sparking the final leg of the race to decipher the structure of DNA.

00:14:25.181 --> 00:14:30.351
While Wilkins and Franklin were working away at Kings College London, 100 kilometres

00:14:30.381 --> 00:14:37.001
north, at Cambridge University, two young men were also trying to crack the code.

00:14:38.274 --> 00:14:45.586
Their names were Francis Crick and James Watson, and neither was a biologist by training.

00:14:46.876 --> 00:14:51.976
Crick was a physicist, and Watson, who had travelled to Cambridge from

00:14:51.976 --> 00:14:56.826
the United States, was a zoologist, an expert in the study of animals.

00:14:57.606 --> 00:15:02.036
And, while at Kings College London, Franklin and Wilkins were taking

00:15:02.036 --> 00:15:07.376
photographs and conducting experiments, at Cambridge, Watson and Crick were

00:15:07.386 --> 00:15:12.546
trying to figure out the structure of DNA using a more theoretical approach.

00:15:14.176 --> 00:15:20.796
Key to this was the work of Franklin and Wilkins, and, in particular, Franklin’s

00:15:20.806 --> 00:15:26.616
famous Photo 51, the photo that showed that DNA had a helical structure.

00:15:27.846 --> 00:15:31.706
Now, there are varying accounts of what happened next.

00:15:32.326 --> 00:15:36.966
Some say that Wilkins showed Photo 51 to Watson and

00:15:36.966 --> 00:15:40.576
Crick without the permission of Rosalind Franklin.

00:15:41.376 --> 00:15:45.066
Other accounts suggest that Franklin did give permission.

00:15:46.236 --> 00:15:52.646
What is clear is that Watson and Crick were shown Photo 51, and this gave

00:15:52.646 --> 00:15:58.016
the pair the critical data they needed to solve the structure of DNA.

00:15:58.776 --> 00:16:03.476
The two young men rushed back to Cambridge and started to build models

00:16:03.676 --> 00:16:09.436
that could explain how the strands within DNA could fit inside the helix.

00:16:10.496 --> 00:16:17.046
And when I say model, this was literally a physical model, with the men cutting out different

00:16:17.046 --> 00:16:23.476
shapes and trying to place them together in a way that did not contradict the laws of chemistry.

00:16:24.656 --> 00:16:26.446
It did not take them particularly long.

00:16:27.456 --> 00:16:35.400
On a Saturday morning in 1953, Watson and Crick set to work building their physical model of DNA.

00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:39.720
Watson later said they solved the puzzle in just a

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:43.220
few hours—like fitting together pieces of a jigsaw.

00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:51.120
The double helix structure was born, and instinctively, it made sense in a way that no other

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:57.710
model had before, it was the first model of DNA’s structure that obeyed the laws of science.

00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:03.574
According to the legend, Francis Crick rushed into The Eagle pub in

00:17:03.574 --> 00:17:09.294
Cambridge and proclaimed that he and Watson had "found the secret of life".

00:17:10.304 --> 00:17:17.043
They had built the first accurate model of DNA in 1953: the famous double helix.

00:17:17.903 --> 00:17:22.633
The work was published a few months later, in the scientific journal Nature.

00:17:23.913 --> 00:17:28.933
The introduction contained perhaps one of science’s greatest understatements:

00:17:29.753 --> 00:17:35.163
“This structure has novel features which are of considerable biological interest.”

00:17:36.273 --> 00:17:41.783
And then “It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated

00:17:41.993 --> 00:17:47.263
immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material."

00:17:48.543 --> 00:17:56.653
In other words, their model showed how genetic material can duplicate itself from parent to child.

00:17:58.023 --> 00:18:01.373
It was, to state the obvious, revolutionary.

00:18:02.223 --> 00:18:03.953
But not immediately.

00:18:04.823 --> 00:18:09.563
Crick and Watson had just proposed a model; it did seem to

00:18:09.563 --> 00:18:14.093
make perfect sense, but they hadn’t definitely proven anything.

00:18:14.943 --> 00:18:21.403
And indeed, this revolutionary paper was only 900 words long, with no experimental data.

00:18:22.633 --> 00:18:26.492
The next few years were followed with rigorous analysis by the

00:18:26.492 --> 00:18:30.852
scientific community, and their proposed structure stood up.

00:18:31.072 --> 00:18:39.732
It was correct, and in 1962 Crick, Watson and Wilkins jointly received the Nobel Prize.

00:18:40.714 --> 00:18:44.062
Rosalind Franklin, you will note, did not.

00:18:45.282 --> 00:18:51.292
Unfortunately, she had been diagnosed with cancer at the age of 36, and a year

00:18:51.292 --> 00:18:57.542
later, in 1958, four years before the men received the Nobel Prize, she died.

00:18:58.858 --> 00:19:04.963
The Nobel Prize cannot be awarded posthumously, it cannot be awarded to someone who is dead.

00:19:06.053 --> 00:19:10.463
And for a long time, Rosalind Franklin did not receive much recognition

00:19:10.503 --> 00:19:17.043
at all for her work on DNA, and all the credit went to Crick and Watson,

00:19:17.163 --> 00:19:20.663
with Wilkins getting the credit for the King’s College London part.

00:19:21.293 --> 00:19:25.993
She was written out of the story, in part because of her early death, but

00:19:25.993 --> 00:19:31.163
also because the men who did get the credit largely neglected to mention her.

00:19:32.073 --> 00:19:37.743
Of course, this is deeply unfair and has been used as yet another example of

00:19:37.743 --> 00:19:42.503
how women get a raw deal in the male-dominated world of scientific research,

00:19:42.853 --> 00:19:47.843
and how their often tireless work behind the scenes is written out of history.

00:19:48.812 --> 00:19:54.943
Thankfully, the contribution of Rosalind Franklin is now much more widely known, and even

00:19:54.943 --> 00:20:00.917
the Nature journal describes her work as “crucial to the discovery of the structure of DNA”.

00:20:02.153 --> 00:20:06.393
And the discovery of the structure of DNA, and therefore how

00:20:06.393 --> 00:20:10.965
DNA works, has touched a myriad of aspects of modern life.

00:20:11.825 --> 00:20:15.635
Over the following decades, scientists learned how to read

00:20:15.655 --> 00:20:21.123
the genetic code, sequence entire genomes, and even edit DNA.

00:20:22.205 --> 00:20:28.485
Today, the study of DNA is central to medicine, agriculture, and countless other fields.

00:20:29.394 --> 00:20:34.117
In the example of medicine, thanks to our understanding of DNA, doctors

00:20:34.247 --> 00:20:38.527
can now identify genetic mutations that cause diseases like cancer.

00:20:39.177 --> 00:20:45.337
This means treatments can be more targeted, focusing on what’s causing the disease at its core.

00:20:46.097 --> 00:20:49.907
And, to state the obvious, there is still a huge amount of work

00:20:49.977 --> 00:20:54.497
being done on better understanding and decoding the structure of DNA.

00:20:55.397 --> 00:20:58.547
One of the biggest breakthroughs came with the Human Genome

00:20:58.547 --> 00:21:02.988
Project, which mapped out all the genes in human DNA.

00:21:03.787 --> 00:21:10.057
And now, DNA sequencing—reading the genetic code—has become faster and cheaper.

00:21:10.807 --> 00:21:14.237
This is opening up exciting possibilities for the future.

00:21:14.617 --> 00:21:17.757
Imagine going to a doctor and getting a treatment

00:21:17.947 --> 00:21:21.874
that’s custom-made for you based on your unique DNA.

00:21:22.647 --> 00:21:30.057
Then there’s gene editing, with tools like CRISPR, which let scientists make precise changes to DNA.

00:21:30.767 --> 00:21:36.417
This could help us cure genetic diseases or even prevent them before they happen.

00:21:37.537 --> 00:21:40.467
Of course, it raises big ethical questions.

00:21:41.127 --> 00:21:46.017
Every parent wants their child to be happy and healthy, but should parents

00:21:46.047 --> 00:21:51.887
also be allowed to select traits like height, eye colour or even intelligence?

00:21:52.447 --> 00:21:57.755
Could this lead to a future where only the wealthy can ‘enhance’ their children’s DNA?"

00:21:58.537 --> 00:22:03.897
The potential is enormous, and it’s exciting and controversial in equal measure.

00:22:04.758 --> 00:22:09.847
DNA has been described as the “code of life,” and now, for the first

00:22:09.857 --> 00:22:13.927
time, we’re starting to learn how to read—and even write—that code.

00:22:15.587 --> 00:22:21.237
OK then, that is it for today's episode on DNA, the building blocks of

00:22:21.237 --> 00:22:26.027
life, and the long and fascinating journey to discover its structure.

00:22:26.717 --> 00:22:30.147
As a reminder, this was part two of our three-part

00:22:30.147 --> 00:22:33.241
mini-series on the theme of “scientific discovery”.

00:22:33.441 --> 00:22:37.261
In part one, we looked at leap years, and next up we

00:22:37.261 --> 00:22:40.711
will be learning about how mathematics changed the world.

00:22:41.365 --> 00:22:46.055
You've been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo English.

00:22:46.465 --> 00:22:51.985
