Hello, hello, hello, and welcome

00:00:07.971 --> 00:00:09.781
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.781 --> 00:00:12.551
Minds, by Leonardo English, the show

00:00:12.551 --> 00:00:14.251
where you can listen to fascinating

00:00:14.251 --> 00:00:16.681
stories and learn weird and wonderful

00:00:16.691 --> 00:00:18.691
things about the world at the same

00:00:18.691 --> 00:00:20.541
time as improving your English.

00:00:21.151 --> 00:00:23.781
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is part

00:00:23.811 --> 00:00:26.851
two of our three-part mini-series on

00:00:26.931 --> 00:00:29.367
unusual characters from World War I.

00:00:29.941 --> 00:00:32.471
In part one, we learned about the British

00:00:32.511 --> 00:00:35.251
army officer who fought alongside Arabian

00:00:35.251 --> 00:00:38.231
tribes, T.E. Lawrence, or Lawrence

00:00:38.251 --> 00:00:40.041
of Arabia, as he was better known.

00:00:41.101 --> 00:00:43.221
In part three, the next episode,

00:00:43.421 --> 00:00:45.151
we’ll learn about Manfred von

00:00:45.151 --> 00:00:48.011
Richthofen, the so-called Red Baron.

00:00:48.391 --> 00:00:50.591
And in today’s episode, we will be

00:00:50.591 --> 00:00:53.931
talking about Mata Hari, the Dutch exotic

00:00:53.931 --> 00:00:57.271
dancer accused of being a German spy.

00:00:57.761 --> 00:01:01.401
It is an amazing story of luxury, poverty,

00:01:01.531 --> 00:01:04.881
seduction, spycraft, betrayal, and more.

00:01:05.221 --> 00:01:07.221
So, let’s not waste a minute

00:01:07.621 --> 00:01:09.732
and get right into it.

00:01:11.011 --> 00:01:14.331
The 15th of October 1917

00:01:14.671 --> 00:01:16.921
was a particularly cold and

00:01:16.921 --> 00:01:18.731
frosty morning in Paris.

00:01:19.321 --> 00:01:21.941
The sun was just starting to come up.

00:01:23.141 --> 00:01:25.751
Earlier that morning, a 41-year-old

00:01:25.751 --> 00:01:27.601
woman had been dragged from

00:01:27.601 --> 00:01:30.091
her cell in Paris’ Saint Lazare

00:01:30.091 --> 00:01:33.131
prison and bustled into a car.

00:01:34.391 --> 00:01:36.641
She was driven a few kilometres

00:01:36.651 --> 00:01:39.347
east, to the castle at Vincennes.

00:01:40.741 --> 00:01:42.711
She was frogmarched out of the

00:01:42.711 --> 00:01:46.131
car and taken to a secluded area

00:01:46.251 --> 00:01:48.511
of the castle grounds, where

00:01:48.751 --> 00:01:51.001
she was placed against a pole.

00:01:52.101 --> 00:01:54.781
A prison guard attempted to put a

00:01:54.811 --> 00:01:58.141
bandage over her eyes; she refused it.

00:01:58.811 --> 00:02:00.911
She looked straight at the men

00:02:01.111 --> 00:02:02.841
pointing their rifles at her.

00:02:03.671 --> 00:02:05.631
Similarly, she refused

00:02:05.671 --> 00:02:07.361
for her hands to be tied.

00:02:07.911 --> 00:02:10.431
She knew the fate that awaited her.

00:02:10.921 --> 00:02:12.701
She would meet it head on.

00:02:13.941 --> 00:02:17.401
One account even has her blowing kisses

00:02:17.601 --> 00:02:20.991
at the men, one last performance for a

00:02:21.001 --> 00:02:24.201
woman who had lived her life on the stage.

00:02:25.191 --> 00:02:28.301
The men pulled their triggers, and

00:02:28.301 --> 00:02:30.971
she fell to the floor in a heap.

00:02:32.121 --> 00:02:35.111
Her body, this body that had played no

00:02:35.111 --> 00:02:37.531
small part in making her one of the most

00:02:37.541 --> 00:02:41.081
famous and desirable women in Europe, was

00:02:41.081 --> 00:02:43.921
sent to the Paris medical school to be

00:02:43.921 --> 00:02:46.961
used as dissection practice by students.

00:02:48.061 --> 00:02:51.491
This was the fate of Mata Hari, a woman

00:02:51.501 --> 00:02:54.081
once called "arguably the greatest

00:02:54.091 --> 00:02:56.771
female spy of the 20th century."

00:02:57.613 --> 00:03:00.833
Now, to understand how things came to

00:03:00.833 --> 00:03:03.513
this and, indeed, to answer the question

00:03:03.723 --> 00:03:06.343
of whether she was even a spy, we need

00:03:06.343 --> 00:03:08.483
to go all the way back to the start.

00:03:09.573 --> 00:03:13.913
She was born Margaretha Zelle in 1876

00:03:14.273 --> 00:03:16.683
in Leeuwarden, in the Netherlands.

00:03:17.533 --> 00:03:20.293
Her father was a rich man, and

00:03:20.323 --> 00:03:22.313
owned a successful hat business.

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.403
Her early life was one of affluence and

00:03:26.413 --> 00:03:29.313
luxury; She was taught the piano, she

00:03:29.313 --> 00:03:31.673
took dance lessons, she learned multiple

00:03:31.673 --> 00:03:34.823
languages, and she went to a fancy school.

00:03:35.983 --> 00:03:39.083
But when she was 13 years old,

00:03:39.483 --> 00:03:41.633
things came crashing down.

00:03:42.411 --> 00:03:44.991
Her father had made some speculative,

00:03:45.371 --> 00:03:47.331
and clearly very bad, investments

00:03:47.491 --> 00:03:49.891
in the oil industry and was

00:03:49.891 --> 00:03:51.941
forced to declare bankruptcy.

00:03:52.925 --> 00:03:54.635
Her parents divorced, and

00:03:54.635 --> 00:03:56.735
her mother died a year later.

00:03:57.825 --> 00:03:59.655
The young Margaretha was sent

00:03:59.665 --> 00:04:01.915
to live with an uncle in a small

00:04:01.915 --> 00:04:04.965
town nearby, and encouraged to

00:04:04.995 --> 00:04:06.935
train to become a school teacher.

00:04:08.255 --> 00:04:10.435
But the life of a small-town

00:04:10.435 --> 00:04:12.155
schoolteacher was somewhat

00:04:12.195 --> 00:04:14.585
different to what she had in mind.

00:04:15.375 --> 00:04:18.874
She was confident, outgoing, and not

00:04:18.934 --> 00:04:21.434
particularly good at following the rules.

00:04:22.234 --> 00:04:24.504
She was also developing into

00:04:24.504 --> 00:04:26.014
a beautiful young woman.

00:04:26.894 --> 00:04:29.684
Tall, striking, with dark brown

00:04:29.684 --> 00:04:32.414
hair and almost East Asian features,

00:04:32.704 --> 00:04:34.824
she naturally drew attention.

00:04:36.164 --> 00:04:37.824
At the teacher-training school,

00:04:38.164 --> 00:04:40.234
she caught the eye of the school

00:04:40.234 --> 00:04:42.248
principal, a middle-aged man

00:04:42.528 --> 00:04:44.778
whose behaviour, by most accounts,

00:04:44.988 --> 00:04:47.018
crossed inappropriate boundaries.

00:04:47.798 --> 00:04:51.828
What exactly happened remains unclear—some

00:04:51.838 --> 00:04:55.098
say she flirted back, others that she was

00:04:55.098 --> 00:04:58.598
simply caught up in his advances—but the

00:04:58.598 --> 00:05:01.618
result was the same: she was caught in a

00:05:01.648 --> 00:05:04.718
compromising situation, a scandal erupted,

00:05:04.968 --> 00:05:07.468
and she was soon removed from the school.

00:05:08.698 --> 00:05:11.288
Seeking adventure, or at least seeking

00:05:11.348 --> 00:05:13.378
anything that might take her away

00:05:13.588 --> 00:05:16.188
from the small Dutch town in which she

00:05:16.188 --> 00:05:19.243
felt suffocated, one day her eyes were

00:05:19.243 --> 00:05:21.783
drawn to an advert in a newspaper.

00:05:22.953 --> 00:05:26.473
It was from a 38-year-old wealthy army

00:05:26.483 --> 00:05:29.223
captain who was looking for a wife.

00:05:30.033 --> 00:05:32.833
Without much to lose, the 18-year-old

00:05:33.103 --> 00:05:37.013
Margaretha Zelle answered, and within a

00:05:37.013 --> 00:05:40.023
week, the pair were engaged to be married.

00:05:41.133 --> 00:05:44.273
His name was Rudolf MacLeod, and

00:05:44.653 --> 00:05:46.913
almost immediately, they went back

00:05:47.123 --> 00:05:49.653
to the Dutch East Indies–modern day

00:05:49.653 --> 00:05:52.373
Indonesia–where MacLeod was stationed.

00:05:53.953 --> 00:05:56.513
Although the young Margaretha might

00:05:56.513 --> 00:05:58.393
have felt that she was finally free

00:05:58.723 --> 00:06:01.783
and off on a wonderful adventure, her

00:06:01.783 --> 00:06:04.743
marriage was unhappy from the outset.

00:06:05.703 --> 00:06:07.863
MacLeod was hot-tempered,

00:06:08.213 --> 00:06:10.373
jealous and alcoholic.

00:06:11.173 --> 00:06:14.483
He wanted his wife to stay at home, appear

00:06:14.503 --> 00:06:17.093
at social events only when he approved

00:06:17.113 --> 00:06:20.473
them, and be a good little colonial wife

00:06:20.623 --> 00:06:22.923
who obeyed her husband’s every wish.

00:06:24.043 --> 00:06:26.163
Margaretha, now Margaretha

00:06:26.163 --> 00:06:28.523
MacLeod, had other ideas.

00:06:29.163 --> 00:06:31.453
She thrived in the limelight, she

00:06:31.463 --> 00:06:33.063
enjoyed the attention of the other

00:06:33.073 --> 00:06:35.903
officers, she revelled in the exotic

00:06:35.903 --> 00:06:38.293
nature of her new colonial life.

00:06:39.203 --> 00:06:41.893
Both she and MacLeod had multiple

00:06:41.893 --> 00:06:44.453
lovers, and it is here where

00:06:44.453 --> 00:06:45.893
it gets a little unpleasant.

00:06:46.693 --> 00:06:49.023
MacLeod caught syphilis,

00:06:49.253 --> 00:06:51.453
which he passed to his wife.

00:06:52.543 --> 00:06:55.193
The pair had had two children in

00:06:55.193 --> 00:06:58.293
quick succession, a boy and a girl.

00:06:59.513 --> 00:07:01.463
And shortly after the birth

00:07:01.563 --> 00:07:03.803
of the second child, both of

00:07:03.803 --> 00:07:06.003
their children became very ill.

00:07:07.233 --> 00:07:09.003
And the boy, who was only

00:07:09.003 --> 00:07:11.393
two years old, sadly died.

00:07:12.643 --> 00:07:14.963
Now, the reason for the illness

00:07:15.033 --> 00:07:17.033
and the poor boy’s death is

00:07:17.033 --> 00:07:18.693
still not completely clear.

00:07:19.743 --> 00:07:23.253
Magaretha and her husband said an angry

00:07:23.253 --> 00:07:26.153
servant had poisoned them, and there

00:07:26.153 --> 00:07:28.693
was even a rumour that a rival army

00:07:28.713 --> 00:07:31.083
officer had poisoned the children’s food.

00:07:32.203 --> 00:07:34.243
It seems more probable that

00:07:34.253 --> 00:07:36.053
they got mercury poisoning.

00:07:36.873 --> 00:07:40.413
At the time, toxic mercury was thought

00:07:40.473 --> 00:07:43.213
to be a helpful treatment for syphilis,

00:07:43.673 --> 00:07:46.613
and both children were passed syphilis

00:07:46.623 --> 00:07:48.813
from their mother during pregnancy.

00:07:49.743 --> 00:07:52.203
They were given mercury as a treatment

00:07:52.213 --> 00:07:55.593
for the disease, but these mercury pills

00:07:55.903 --> 00:07:58.783
most probably killed Margaretha’s son.

00:07:59.853 --> 00:08:02.053
Distraught, they moved back to

00:08:02.053 --> 00:08:04.243
the Netherlands, and the pair

00:08:04.283 --> 00:08:06.153
separated on their return.

00:08:07.273 --> 00:08:09.184
After the divorce was finalised,

00:08:09.503 --> 00:08:12.453
Margaretha was legally awarded custody

00:08:12.453 --> 00:08:15.513
of their daughter, but her violent,

00:08:15.833 --> 00:08:19.263
alcoholic and abusive husband refused

00:08:19.283 --> 00:08:21.573
to pay any form of child support.

00:08:22.603 --> 00:08:25.213
Without any way of supporting herself

00:08:25.413 --> 00:08:27.493
and her daughter financially, she

00:08:27.503 --> 00:08:29.903
gave in, and sent her daughter

00:08:30.123 --> 00:08:31.713
to go and live with her father.

00:08:32.713 --> 00:08:34.753
Margaretha had now lost

00:08:34.973 --> 00:08:37.233
not one but two children.

00:08:38.393 --> 00:08:41.333
This was 1903, and she

00:08:41.333 --> 00:08:43.243
was only 27 at the time.

00:08:44.503 --> 00:08:46.583
She did what she would later say

00:08:46.583 --> 00:08:48.423
she thought every runaway wife

00:08:48.423 --> 00:08:51.503
did, and that was to go to Paris.

00:08:52.293 --> 00:08:54.623
She had no connections, no money,

00:08:54.883 --> 00:08:58.063
no nothing, but she was determined

00:08:58.093 --> 00:08:59.863
to make something of herself.

00:09:00.744 --> 00:09:03.186
Her primary concern at this point

00:09:03.446 --> 00:09:05.696
was getting back on her feet and

00:09:05.706 --> 00:09:07.756
getting into a situation that would

00:09:07.756 --> 00:09:10.046
allow her to get her daughter back.

00:09:11.506 --> 00:09:14.266
Initially, she tried more traditional

00:09:14.266 --> 00:09:17.016
routes to earn a living: as a German

00:09:17.016 --> 00:09:19.566
teacher, teaching the piano, even

00:09:19.566 --> 00:09:22.066
working as a model in a department store.

00:09:23.616 --> 00:09:25.876
It was a way to eke out a

00:09:25.876 --> 00:09:28.796
living, but it was not enough.

00:09:29.806 --> 00:09:32.666
She returned to the Netherlands, but there

00:09:33.016 --> 00:09:35.406
she came to the realisation that she was

00:09:35.406 --> 00:09:37.316
never going to get her daughter back.

00:09:38.936 --> 00:09:41.396
Now, with all ties to her previous

00:09:41.396 --> 00:09:44.236
life severed, she returns to Paris.

00:09:45.025 --> 00:09:47.720
And it is here that she creates

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.250
the character she will become

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:51.860
known for: Mata Hari, which

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:54.660
means “eye of the day” in Malay.

00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:59.923
In early 1905, she starts to perform this

00:09:59.983 --> 00:10:03.173
exotic dance act in which she wears an

00:10:03.203 --> 00:10:05.916
elaborate hairdress and exotic jewellery.

00:10:07.103 --> 00:10:09.043
And not much else, I should

00:10:09.053 --> 00:10:11.003
add, she was practically naked.

00:10:12.483 --> 00:10:14.733
This dance routine, with the

00:10:14.733 --> 00:10:17.063
stunningly beautiful Mata Hari,

00:10:17.483 --> 00:10:19.453
was soon the talk of the town.

00:10:20.409 --> 00:10:23.594
She created this aura of mystique.

00:10:23.974 --> 00:10:26.454
The name, the jewellery, the music,

00:10:26.594 --> 00:10:29.234
the explicit nature of the performance.

00:10:30.384 --> 00:10:32.854
She was a master of what we would now

00:10:32.854 --> 00:10:36.724
call PR, and she carefully curated her

00:10:36.734 --> 00:10:39.234
image, feeding the press stories about

00:10:39.454 --> 00:10:42.204
being a Javanese princess trained in the

00:10:42.234 --> 00:10:45.114
ancient, sacred art of temple dancing.

00:10:46.354 --> 00:10:48.654
It was, of course, nonsense;

00:10:48.924 --> 00:10:50.884
she was Dutch, had never been

00:10:50.884 --> 00:10:53.714
royalty, and her so-called sacred

00:10:53.724 --> 00:10:56.324
dances were largely improvised,

00:10:56.504 --> 00:10:58.554
she made them up there and then.

00:10:59.166 --> 00:11:00.987
But nobody cared.

00:11:01.577 --> 00:11:03.276
Or rather, it provided

00:11:03.466 --> 00:11:05.046
a convenient excuse.

00:11:05.426 --> 00:11:07.411
The men weren’t paying to see a

00:11:07.411 --> 00:11:08.966
striptease; they weren’t paying to

00:11:08.966 --> 00:11:10.886
watch a woman take her clothes off;

00:11:11.326 --> 00:11:13.176
they were paying to witness some

00:11:13.176 --> 00:11:16.026
fascinating exotic dance from the east.

00:11:17.006 --> 00:11:18.366
Or at least, that’s what

00:11:18.366 --> 00:11:19.526
people told themselves.

00:11:20.236 --> 00:11:22.406
Audiences were mesmerised.

00:11:22.656 --> 00:11:24.266
The more the newspapers wrote

00:11:24.276 --> 00:11:26.026
about her, the more people

00:11:26.026 --> 00:11:27.896
wanted to believe the fantasy.

00:11:28.886 --> 00:11:31.646
She masterfully manipulated the press,

00:11:31.996 --> 00:11:34.116
ensuring that stories about her were

00:11:34.146 --> 00:11:36.296
printed in the biggest papers in Europe.

00:11:36.896 --> 00:11:39.516
She cultivated journalists, gave

00:11:39.516 --> 00:11:42.286
them juicy details, and let them

00:11:42.556 --> 00:11:44.826
build the legend of Mata Hari.

00:11:45.976 --> 00:11:48.296
And soon, it wasn’t just Paris.

00:11:48.786 --> 00:11:51.316
She performed across Europe’s grandest

00:11:51.316 --> 00:11:53.746
stages: at the Scala in Milan,

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:56.876
in Madrid, in Vienna, in Berlin.

00:11:57.706 --> 00:11:59.446
Everywhere she went, she

00:11:59.446 --> 00:12:01.146
was the centre of attention.

00:12:02.506 --> 00:12:05.826
She was paid a reported 10,000 francs

00:12:05.826 --> 00:12:08.126
per show, which is the equivalent

00:12:08.376 --> 00:12:11.666
of around €40,000 in today’s money.

00:12:12.976 --> 00:12:15.116
To state the obvious, this turned

00:12:15.116 --> 00:12:18.136
her into a very wealthy woman, but

00:12:18.546 --> 00:12:21.086
perhaps more importantly, and certainly

00:12:21.096 --> 00:12:22.586
more importantly for the rest of

00:12:22.586 --> 00:12:25.256
this story, it made her one of the

00:12:25.256 --> 00:12:27.576
most sought-after women in Paris

00:12:28.546 --> 00:12:30.575
She became the mistress of some of

00:12:30.575 --> 00:12:32.855
the richest and most powerful men in

00:12:32.855 --> 00:12:36.675
Europe: politicians, generals, diplomats.

00:12:37.055 --> 00:12:39.035
She seemed to have a particular

00:12:39.035 --> 00:12:41.422
preference for men in the military.

00:12:42.892 --> 00:12:45.962
And her lovers showered her with diamonds,

00:12:46.252 --> 00:12:49.032
fur coats, and lavish apartments.

00:12:49.602 --> 00:12:51.538
She was no longer Margaretha

00:12:51.538 --> 00:12:53.742
Zelle, the poor Dutch girl, or

00:12:54.002 --> 00:12:56.132
Margaretha MacLeod, divorcée.

00:12:56.972 --> 00:12:59.532
She was Mata Hari, the most

00:12:59.562 --> 00:13:01.392
desired woman in Europe.

00:13:02.192 --> 00:13:05.612
But fame is fleeting, and by the

00:13:05.612 --> 00:13:08.562
early 1910s, she had somewhat fallen

00:13:08.562 --> 00:13:10.752
out of favour, as a dancer at least.

00:13:11.362 --> 00:13:13.312
There were younger women doing a

00:13:13.312 --> 00:13:16.272
similar thing, and Mata Hari found

00:13:16.272 --> 00:13:18.242
herself leaning more on her wealthy

00:13:18.242 --> 00:13:20.312
lovers than on her dancing career.

00:13:21.492 --> 00:13:25.112
And then in 1914, everything changed.

00:13:25.892 --> 00:13:28.672
When war broke out, the world of glamour

00:13:28.872 --> 00:13:32.052
and excess vanished almost overnight.

00:13:32.912 --> 00:13:35.052
Suddenly, being an international

00:13:35.052 --> 00:13:37.512
woman with connections to powerful men

00:13:37.702 --> 00:13:40.102
in multiple countries, men who were

00:13:40.102 --> 00:13:43.242
now officers in an enemy army, was

00:13:43.242 --> 00:13:45.732
not intriguing in a good way; it was

00:13:45.732 --> 00:13:48.482
intriguing in a very bad way indeed.

00:13:49.628 --> 00:13:52.462
Spymania broke out in France, with

00:13:52.502 --> 00:13:54.602
authorities monitoring anyone who

00:13:54.602 --> 00:13:56.252
they believed might have links

00:13:56.252 --> 00:13:58.288
to foreign powers and who might

00:13:58.288 --> 00:14:00.678
be tempted to pass along secrets.

00:14:02.058 --> 00:14:05.078
And Mata Hari soon realised she would

00:14:05.088 --> 00:14:08.058
be a prime target for such advances.

00:14:09.179 --> 00:14:12.488
In 1915, when in The Hague, she was

00:14:12.488 --> 00:14:14.548
approached by a German official.

00:14:15.548 --> 00:14:18.588
He offered her 20,000 francs—a

00:14:18.588 --> 00:14:21.238
huge sum—for information on

00:14:21.238 --> 00:14:22.858
French military movements.

00:14:23.751 --> 00:14:26.748
Her code name was to be H21.

00:14:27.741 --> 00:14:29.511
Mata Hari accepted the

00:14:29.511 --> 00:14:31.291
money, saying, “Sure thing”.

00:14:32.231 --> 00:14:34.741
But whether she actually intended on

00:14:34.801 --> 00:14:37.969
passing on any secrets is up for debate.

00:14:38.699 --> 00:14:40.449
According to most historians,

00:14:40.689 --> 00:14:42.649
she had no intention of doing so.

00:14:43.429 --> 00:14:45.629
She took the money, just as

00:14:45.639 --> 00:14:47.139
she had always taken money

00:14:47.309 --> 00:14:48.909
from men who offered it to her.

00:14:49.819 --> 00:14:51.859
Perhaps she considered it a

00:14:51.859 --> 00:14:53.799
kind of severance package.

00:14:54.369 --> 00:14:56.439
She had been in Germany when war

00:14:56.449 --> 00:14:58.839
was declared, and large amounts of

00:14:58.839 --> 00:15:00.869
her property had been confiscated,

00:15:01.239 --> 00:15:03.529
so this was one way to make up

00:15:03.529 --> 00:15:05.329
for it, in her mind at least.

00:15:06.599 --> 00:15:09.469
And in any case, she had spent the past

00:15:09.469 --> 00:15:12.199
10 years accepting large sums of money

00:15:12.429 --> 00:15:14.409
from men on the understanding that

00:15:14.409 --> 00:15:16.359
she might do something in the future.

00:15:16.959 --> 00:15:19.069
Why should this be any different?

00:15:19.983 --> 00:15:21.963
But once she had accepted the

00:15:21.963 --> 00:15:24.033
money, the line was blurred.

00:15:24.463 --> 00:15:27.143
The Germans now had her on record

00:15:27.433 --> 00:15:29.173
as accepting money from them.

00:15:30.216 --> 00:15:32.326
And whether she meant to spy

00:15:32.336 --> 00:15:34.466
or not, that receipt of payment

00:15:34.636 --> 00:15:36.286
would later be used against her.

00:15:37.603 --> 00:15:40.953
Now, this was in 1915, and shortly

00:15:40.953 --> 00:15:42.943
after, something happened to her

00:15:43.243 --> 00:15:45.103
that had never happened before.

00:15:46.243 --> 00:15:47.193
She fell in love.

00:15:48.253 --> 00:15:50.783
Yes, she'd been married, and she

00:15:50.783 --> 00:15:52.983
had had many lovers who had no doubt

00:15:53.113 --> 00:15:55.953
declared their love for her, but it

00:15:55.953 --> 00:15:58.073
wasn’t until she met a young Russian

00:15:58.113 --> 00:16:01.143
officer, 20 years her junior, that

00:16:01.183 --> 00:16:03.393
she ever felt quite the same way.

00:16:04.173 --> 00:16:06.563
His name was Vladimir de Masloff.

00:16:07.643 --> 00:16:09.653
Shortly after they met, he was

00:16:09.653 --> 00:16:12.003
sent to the front lines and was

00:16:12.013 --> 00:16:14.283
badly wounded, losing an eye.

00:16:14.831 --> 00:16:17.103
Desperate to see him and ensure

00:16:17.103 --> 00:16:19.433
he was safe, she needed permission

00:16:19.433 --> 00:16:22.123
to travel, and that required a

00:16:22.133 --> 00:16:24.183
favour from the French military.

00:16:25.343 --> 00:16:27.463
It was at this moment that French

00:16:27.493 --> 00:16:29.823
intelligence saw their opportunity.

00:16:30.833 --> 00:16:32.133
Although they didn’t know about

00:16:32.133 --> 00:16:34.313
the meeting with the German and her

00:16:34.313 --> 00:16:37.443
acceptance of the 20,000 francs, they

00:16:37.443 --> 00:16:40.033
had been watching her like a hawk.

00:16:41.013 --> 00:16:43.553
She spoke multiple languages, travelled

00:16:43.553 --> 00:16:46.507
around Europe, had many military officers

00:16:46.727 --> 00:16:49.906
as lovers, and was prepared to bend the

00:16:49.906 --> 00:16:52.586
rules of society, for a fee of course.

00:16:53.646 --> 00:16:55.966
She ticked all the boxes the

00:16:55.966 --> 00:16:57.816
French authorities had for

00:16:58.176 --> 00:16:59.846
“characteristics of a spy”.

00:17:01.186 --> 00:17:03.466
So, when she arrived at the French

00:17:03.466 --> 00:17:06.336
intelligence agency to ask for a permit

00:17:06.586 --> 00:17:08.306
to go and visit her wounded Russian

00:17:08.306 --> 00:17:11.126
lover, she was surprised to find the

00:17:11.126 --> 00:17:13.286
head of French counterintelligence,

00:17:13.556 --> 00:17:16.306
Georges Ladoux, make her an offer.

00:17:17.556 --> 00:17:20.036
He asked her if she was interested

00:17:20.306 --> 00:17:22.756
in becoming a spy for France.

00:17:24.196 --> 00:17:27.046
Her role would be to travel to Belgium,

00:17:27.526 --> 00:17:30.646
seduce German army officers, find

00:17:30.656 --> 00:17:33.196
valuable information about German military

00:17:33.196 --> 00:17:36.316
plans, and pass these back to France.

00:17:37.536 --> 00:17:39.436
Various sums were discussed.

00:17:40.176 --> 00:17:43.606
Mata Hari negotiated and was offered a

00:17:43.606 --> 00:17:46.536
reported one million francs, something

00:17:46.536 --> 00:17:49.646
like 4 million Euros in today’s money.

00:17:50.386 --> 00:17:52.316
The fee would be paid on the

00:17:52.346 --> 00:17:54.606
successful completion of the mission.

00:17:55.606 --> 00:17:58.126
She needed the money, and this could

00:17:58.136 --> 00:18:01.186
be her “last hurrah”, her opportunity

00:18:01.386 --> 00:18:03.856
to marry her Russian lover and set

00:18:03.886 --> 00:18:06.416
herself up for life, without ever

00:18:06.583 --> 00:18:08.336
having to worry about money again.

00:18:09.506 --> 00:18:11.246
She accepted Ladoux’s offer.

00:18:12.176 --> 00:18:15.456
But importantly, she never told him

00:18:15.656 --> 00:18:17.976
about accepting the 20,000 Francs

00:18:18.156 --> 00:18:20.406
from the Germans a year beforehand.

00:18:21.486 --> 00:18:23.441
This would come back to bite her.

00:18:24.471 --> 00:18:26.541
She tried to get to Belgium to

00:18:26.541 --> 00:18:28.841
get started on her task, but

00:18:28.841 --> 00:18:31.071
found herself caught up in Spain.

00:18:32.241 --> 00:18:34.231
She tried to contact Ladoux for

00:18:34.251 --> 00:18:36.091
instructions on how to proceed,

00:18:36.571 --> 00:18:38.891
but never received a response.

00:18:40.311 --> 00:18:42.621
Taking matters into her own hands,

00:18:42.891 --> 00:18:45.541
and keen to get the job done so she

00:18:45.541 --> 00:18:48.411
could be paid, she found a German army

00:18:48.411 --> 00:18:51.371
officer in Madrid, and seduced him.

00:18:52.431 --> 00:18:54.381
In a bid to get him to reveal

00:18:54.381 --> 00:18:57.401
information, she told him that she was

00:18:57.401 --> 00:19:02.411
a German spy and her code name was H21.

00:19:03.161 --> 00:19:05.941
He then sends a telegram back to

00:19:05.941 --> 00:19:07.593
the German intelligence service,

00:19:07.611 --> 00:19:09.781
letting them know that he has made

00:19:09.781 --> 00:19:13.701
contact with Agent H21 and informing

00:19:13.701 --> 00:19:15.508
them about what she has told him.

00:19:16.664 --> 00:19:19.243
But, and here's where things start

00:19:19.243 --> 00:19:21.217
to get a little complicated, he

00:19:21.217 --> 00:19:23.477
sends the telegram in a code that

00:19:23.487 --> 00:19:25.847
he almost certainly knows the French

00:19:25.847 --> 00:19:28.057
have cracked, suggesting that he

00:19:28.057 --> 00:19:30.297
wants her identity to be discovered.

00:19:31.497 --> 00:19:34.197
Sure enough, the French intercept the

00:19:34.197 --> 00:19:37.427
telegram, decrypt the letter, and read

00:19:37.457 --> 00:19:41.183
the extensive descriptions of “agent H21”.

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:45.227
Unmistakably, it is Mata Hari.

00:19:46.727 --> 00:19:48.727
On her return to Paris, in

00:19:48.727 --> 00:19:51.607
February 1917, she was arrested.

00:19:52.487 --> 00:19:55.537
She was interrogated for months, held

00:19:55.767 --> 00:19:58.327
in the grim Saint-Lazare prison, and

00:19:58.327 --> 00:20:00.877
subjected to intense questioning.

00:20:02.047 --> 00:20:04.247
The trial was a show trial.

00:20:04.707 --> 00:20:06.827
She was accused of being responsible

00:20:07.017 --> 00:20:09.857
for the deaths of 50,000 French

00:20:09.857 --> 00:20:12.627
soldiers—despite zero concrete

00:20:12.657 --> 00:20:14.277
evidence that she had ever

00:20:14.277 --> 00:20:16.637
passed on a single useful secret.

00:20:17.727 --> 00:20:19.167
The press, once her

00:20:19.167 --> 00:20:21.281
ally, turned against her.

00:20:21.917 --> 00:20:24.510
Her life as a dancer and a courtesan,

00:20:24.807 --> 00:20:27.487
her divorce, her promiscuous lifestyle,

00:20:27.917 --> 00:20:31.285
this was all used as proof of guilt.

00:20:32.775 --> 00:20:35.385
In her prime, she had used the press

00:20:35.555 --> 00:20:37.845
to build up her image, knowing that

00:20:37.855 --> 00:20:40.265
the story she told was more important

00:20:40.485 --> 00:20:42.705
than the veracity of its details.

00:20:43.697 --> 00:20:46.247
Now, the press used exactly the same

00:20:46.287 --> 00:20:49.117
avoidance of the truth to tear her down.

00:20:50.667 --> 00:20:52.327
She was found guilty of

00:20:52.377 --> 00:20:54.867
espionage and sentenced to death.

00:20:56.227 --> 00:20:59.207
And so we return to that cold morning in

00:20:59.207 --> 00:21:02.927
October 1917, in the castle of Vincennes.

00:21:03.557 --> 00:21:05.267
She was marched to the pole,

00:21:05.677 --> 00:21:07.837
refusing the blindfold, staring

00:21:07.887 --> 00:21:09.457
her executioners in the eye.

00:21:10.917 --> 00:21:13.487
The executioners fired, she fell to

00:21:13.487 --> 00:21:15.977
the floor, and her body was sent to

00:21:15.977 --> 00:21:18.177
be chopped up by medical students.

00:21:19.427 --> 00:21:22.137
It is now more than 100 years since

00:21:22.137 --> 00:21:24.857
her death, and there are still plenty

00:21:24.857 --> 00:21:26.837
of question marks as to whether

00:21:26.837 --> 00:21:29.567
this woman, named by her accusers as

00:21:29.567 --> 00:21:31.397
“the greatest female spy of the 20th

00:21:31.417 --> 00:21:34.548
century”, ever did any spying at all.

00:21:35.677 --> 00:21:38.907
Yes, she accepted money, but there is no

00:21:38.937 --> 00:21:41.417
evidence that she passed any information.

00:21:42.747 --> 00:21:44.057
And if she was a spy,

00:21:44.507 --> 00:21:45.847
she was a very bad one.

00:21:46.557 --> 00:21:48.027
She never attempted to hide

00:21:48.027 --> 00:21:49.537
her encounters, she never

00:21:49.537 --> 00:21:51.417
wrote in code, everything she

00:21:51.417 --> 00:21:53.457
did, she did in plain sight.

00:21:54.917 --> 00:21:57.795
Indeed, on the 100th anniversary of her

00:21:57.795 --> 00:22:01.457
death, in 2017, the French government

00:22:01.697 --> 00:22:04.027
released a bunch of new evidence about

00:22:04.037 --> 00:22:06.647
her life and trial, which seemed to

00:22:06.647 --> 00:22:09.427
confirm what many had long suspected.

00:22:10.317 --> 00:22:12.437
She was a useful scapegoat.

00:22:13.117 --> 00:22:16.317
France was not doing well in the war, and

00:22:16.477 --> 00:22:18.317
if you could point the finger at a woman

00:22:18.517 --> 00:22:20.347
who had lived outside of the norms of

00:22:20.347 --> 00:22:23.777
society, a woman who looked and behaved

00:22:23.777 --> 00:22:27.277
like a spy, well, she made an easy target.

00:22:28.567 --> 00:22:31.037
In fact, you have already met the

00:22:31.037 --> 00:22:33.367
real spy earlier in this episode,

00:22:33.727 --> 00:22:35.877
someone who perhaps was a lot

00:22:35.877 --> 00:22:37.977
more of a spy than Mata Hari.

00:22:38.697 --> 00:22:40.607
George Ladoux, the head of the

00:22:40.617 --> 00:22:42.603
French Intelligence agency and the

00:22:42.603 --> 00:22:45.043
man who tricked and then arrested

00:22:45.063 --> 00:22:48.233
Mata Hari, was himself arrested on

00:22:48.233 --> 00:22:50.673
the charge of being a double agent.

00:22:51.963 --> 00:22:54.373
After the war was over, the charges

00:22:54.653 --> 00:22:57.463
were quietly dropped, and he lived

00:22:57.603 --> 00:22:59.663
the rest of his life a free man.

00:23:01.093 --> 00:23:04.543
Mata Hari was not quite so lucky.

00:23:06.653 --> 00:23:09.253
OK then, that is it for today's episode

00:23:09.453 --> 00:23:12.243
on Mata Hari, the exotic dancer,

00:23:12.435 --> 00:23:15.553
courtesan, and most probably not a spy.

00:23:16.293 --> 00:23:18.673
As a reminder, this is part two

00:23:18.683 --> 00:23:20.643
of a three-part mini-series on

00:23:20.713 --> 00:23:23.242
unusual characters from World War I.

00:23:23.584 --> 00:23:25.739
In the last episode, we had Lawrence of

00:23:25.739 --> 00:23:28.749
Arabia, and next up we will have Manfred

00:23:28.749 --> 00:23:30.799
von Richthofen, the dead-eye German

00:23:30.799 --> 00:23:33.629
pilot better known as The Red Baron.

00:23:34.469 --> 00:23:36.359
You've been listening to English Learning

00:23:36.359 --> 00:23:39.139
for Curious Minds by Leonardo English.

00:23:39.639 --> 00:23:42.399
I'm Alastair Budge, you stay safe, and

00:23:42.399 --> 00:23:44.879
I'll catch you in the next episode.
