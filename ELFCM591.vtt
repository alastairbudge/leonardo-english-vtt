Hello, hello, hello, and welcome

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.150
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.920
Minds, by Leonardo English, the show

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:14.760
where you can listen to fascinating

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.220
stories and learn weird and wonderful

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.289
things about the world at the same

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.160
time as improving your English.

00:00:21.639 --> 00:00:24.970
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:26.910
going to be talking about something

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.970
that might sound improbable:

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.720
Swedish teenage gangsters.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.239
Over the past decade, Sweden has

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.070
seen a rise in violent crime, with an

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.659
increasing amount committed by children.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.100
And in this episode, we’ll explore

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.610
why this is, whether it is as great a

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.000
problem as some have made it out to be,

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.809
and what the country is doing about it.

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.600
OK then, let's not waste a

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.010
minute and get right into it.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.410
Let me start this episode

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.320
by painting you a picture.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.190
This isn’t an invented story;

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.959
it’s true, it’s something that

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.530
happened to me just a few weeks ago.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.300
It was around 6 o’clock in the afternoon.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.020
I had picked up my kids from their

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:19.570
respective schools, and we’d been

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.340
playing in the park with friends.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.479
Football, swings, hide and seek.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.630
On the way back home, one of my sons

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.399
heard a helicopter flying overhead.

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.139
He’d seen a helicopter before, but

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.690
for this two-year-old, it was a

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.570
pretty exciting sight for an otherwise

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.960
uneventful Wednesday afternoon.

00:01:43.246 --> 00:01:45.606
It seemed to be hovering over our

00:01:45.606 --> 00:01:49.036
heads, but after finally managing to

00:01:49.036 --> 00:01:51.516
persuade him to wave goodbye to it,

00:01:51.826 --> 00:01:54.696
we set off on the short journey home.

00:01:55.996 --> 00:01:58.066
I didn’t think much more of it,

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:00.556
but as we were eating dinner

00:02:00.946 --> 00:02:03.056
an hour or so afterwards, my

00:02:03.056 --> 00:02:05.096
son pointed out of the window.

00:02:05.756 --> 00:02:08.676
The helicopter was still there, circling.

00:02:10.076 --> 00:02:12.346
I had my suspicions about what

00:02:12.366 --> 00:02:15.066
this might mean, but I invented

00:02:15.066 --> 00:02:17.486
some excuse: perhaps someone had

00:02:17.486 --> 00:02:19.076
lost their teddy bear or something.

00:02:20.412 --> 00:02:23.142
After they had got to bed, I checked the

00:02:23.142 --> 00:02:26.672
news, and my suspicions were confirmed.

00:02:27.782 --> 00:02:29.722
Just around the time we had

00:02:29.722 --> 00:02:31.712
finished in the playground, a

00:02:31.712 --> 00:02:33.832
member of the public had made a

00:02:33.882 --> 00:02:37.072
grim discovery in a nearby car park.

00:02:37.852 --> 00:02:40.442
The lifeless bodies of two men.

00:02:41.722 --> 00:02:44.702
The police had been called, the area

00:02:44.792 --> 00:02:47.582
cordoned off, and the helicopters were

00:02:47.582 --> 00:02:50.352
not searching for a child’s lost teddy

00:02:50.352 --> 00:02:54.152
bear, but for a murderer, a murderer who

00:02:54.152 --> 00:02:57.572
may very well have been a child themself.

00:02:58.682 --> 00:03:01.362
Now, as of the time of recording this

00:03:01.382 --> 00:03:03.552
episode, the police haven’t released

00:03:03.552 --> 00:03:05.652
any further information about the case.

00:03:06.122 --> 00:03:07.942
They immediately announced that they

00:03:07.942 --> 00:03:11.452
suspected it was part of an ongoing turf

00:03:11.472 --> 00:03:14.982
war between feuding gangs in the north

00:03:15.042 --> 00:03:17.132
of the city, the city of Gothenburg,

00:03:17.432 --> 00:03:19.532
the second largest city in Sweden.

00:03:20.772 --> 00:03:22.972
The two men were well-known to

00:03:22.972 --> 00:03:24.582
the authorities, the police said.

00:03:25.672 --> 00:03:28.402
Nevertheless, the case was shocking.

00:03:29.202 --> 00:03:31.472
The area where they were found

00:03:31.742 --> 00:03:35.262
is a leafy, residential, and safe

00:03:35.282 --> 00:03:37.850
area; it’s not gang territory.

00:03:38.652 --> 00:03:40.772
The dead men had been left in a

00:03:40.872 --> 00:03:43.742
parked car in the car park of a

00:03:43.742 --> 00:03:45.932
neighbourhood supermarket, right next

00:03:45.932 --> 00:03:48.112
to a football club where hundreds

00:03:48.122 --> 00:03:50.362
of children were happily practising.

00:03:51.432 --> 00:03:54.202
It was shocking to me because I live just

00:03:54.202 --> 00:03:56.472
a few hundred metres away; my nearest

00:03:56.472 --> 00:03:59.672
supermarket, a place I often pass through

00:03:59.842 --> 00:04:02.722
with my kids, is that very supermarket.

00:04:03.972 --> 00:04:05.862
But to the Swedish police,

00:04:06.162 --> 00:04:08.692
unfortunately, this has become

00:04:08.932 --> 00:04:11.132
somewhat of a regular occurrence.

00:04:11.952 --> 00:04:17.562
In 2022, there were 391 recorded

00:04:17.572 --> 00:04:20.662
shootings - more than one a day.

00:04:21.532 --> 00:04:24.232
It’s not just guns; that same year,

00:04:24.622 --> 00:04:28.482
there were 149 recorded explosions,

00:04:28.772 --> 00:04:31.032
with everything from grenades being

00:04:31.042 --> 00:04:33.572
thrown through apartment windows to

00:04:33.662 --> 00:04:36.302
bombs being planted behind doors.

00:04:37.312 --> 00:04:39.652
And let’s remember, Sweden is

00:04:39.652 --> 00:04:42.102
a small country, a country of

00:04:42.102 --> 00:04:43.992
just over 10 million people.

00:04:45.202 --> 00:04:48.062
What this has meant is that it now has

00:04:48.062 --> 00:04:51.352
the grim title of the second-highest

00:04:51.362 --> 00:04:54.132
gun crime rate in Europe, with the

00:04:54.232 --> 00:04:57.211
per capita murder rate in Stockholm

00:04:57.751 --> 00:05:01.302
an astounding 30 times that of London.

00:05:02.432 --> 00:05:05.302
And to make matters even scarier,

00:05:05.872 --> 00:05:08.252
the perpetrators of this violence

00:05:08.572 --> 00:05:11.452
are not always grown men, seasoned

00:05:11.472 --> 00:05:13.212
criminals who have spent more

00:05:13.212 --> 00:05:15.524
time inside prison than out.

00:05:16.252 --> 00:05:19.412
They are often teenagers, young boys.

00:05:20.652 --> 00:05:25.682
Indeed, in 2022, almost half the

00:05:25.692 --> 00:05:28.402
suspects in gun-related murders

00:05:28.721 --> 00:05:32.712
were between the ages of 15 and 20.

00:05:33.852 --> 00:05:35.742
And shockingly, sometimes

00:05:35.772 --> 00:05:36.992
they are even younger.

00:05:37.922 --> 00:05:41.292
In early October, six people were

00:05:41.292 --> 00:05:44.102
shot in a town north of Stockholm.

00:05:44.832 --> 00:05:46.472
The shooter, according to

00:05:46.472 --> 00:05:49.622
police, was only 13 years old.

00:05:50.912 --> 00:05:52.782
So, what’s going on?

00:05:53.512 --> 00:05:55.492
To most people, the image they have

00:05:55.492 --> 00:05:58.242
of Sweden is one of beautiful lakes,

00:05:58.462 --> 00:06:00.462
stylish men and women with great

00:06:00.472 --> 00:06:03.012
hair and flawless English, IKEA

00:06:03.012 --> 00:06:06.522
furniture, not of violence and murder.

00:06:07.312 --> 00:06:09.792
Well, like any complex problem,

00:06:10.072 --> 00:06:12.612
there are differing viewpoints on the

00:06:12.652 --> 00:06:15.252
causes and, therefore, the solutions.

00:06:16.452 --> 00:06:19.942
What is unfortunately undeniable is

00:06:19.942 --> 00:06:22.302
that the situation is out of hand.

00:06:22.932 --> 00:06:25.112
Gun-related violence has been

00:06:25.112 --> 00:06:27.432
rising in Sweden over the past

00:06:27.502 --> 00:06:29.882
20 years or so, bucking the trend

00:06:30.082 --> 00:06:32.062
of every other European country.

00:06:33.012 --> 00:06:36.192
Some years it has come down, and indeed

00:06:36.202 --> 00:06:39.215
it has come down slightly since 2022,

00:06:39.642 --> 00:06:42.422
but the overall trend is upwards.

00:06:43.442 --> 00:06:46.432
And the age of the perpetrators, those

00:06:46.552 --> 00:06:48.492
pulling the triggers, planting the

00:06:48.492 --> 00:06:51.592
bombs and throwing the grenades, has

00:06:51.632 --> 00:06:54.192
unfortunately been trending downwards;

00:06:54.662 --> 00:06:57.092
the killers have been getting younger.

00:06:58.454 --> 00:07:01.394
According to Brå, which is the Swedish

00:07:01.444 --> 00:07:03.884
National Council for Crime Prevention,

00:07:04.364 --> 00:07:07.134
there are several factors behind this.

00:07:08.214 --> 00:07:10.944
Firstly, the makeup of criminal

00:07:10.944 --> 00:07:12.944
gangs in Sweden has changed.

00:07:13.404 --> 00:07:16.454
Historically, they were more hierarchical,

00:07:16.734 --> 00:07:18.904
with a big boss controlling large

00:07:18.924 --> 00:07:20.954
parts of an area’s criminal activity.

00:07:22.134 --> 00:07:25.724
Starting in the early 2010s, however, it's

00:07:25.724 --> 00:07:29.304
become more regional, with smaller, more

00:07:29.314 --> 00:07:32.224
local gangs that exerted tighter control

00:07:32.514 --> 00:07:35.304
especially over an area’s drug market.

00:07:36.764 --> 00:07:40.244
These gangs also became more willing

00:07:40.264 --> 00:07:42.944
to use violence, and in particular,

00:07:43.204 --> 00:07:45.814
lethal force to resolve disputes.

00:07:46.914 --> 00:07:49.794
Previously, resorting to murder was

00:07:49.834 --> 00:07:52.054
a serious affair that might require

00:07:52.064 --> 00:07:54.324
approval from the upper echelons of

00:07:54.324 --> 00:07:58.014
the organisation; with smaller, more

00:07:58.034 --> 00:08:01.244
fragmented groups, lethal force often

00:08:01.254 --> 00:08:03.984
became the primary way to resolve a

00:08:04.024 --> 00:08:07.114
conflict, even ones that might previously

00:08:07.124 --> 00:08:09.824
have been resolved in non-violent ways,

00:08:10.194 --> 00:08:12.564
or at least, with non-lethal force.

00:08:13.364 --> 00:08:16.604
And from this emerged a new type

00:08:16.624 --> 00:08:19.254
of criminal: the teenage killer.

00:08:20.524 --> 00:08:23.694
To quote directly the Swedish National

00:08:23.704 --> 00:08:26.244
Council for Crime Prevention, “These

00:08:26.264 --> 00:08:29.224
individuals did not always have strong

00:08:29.374 --> 00:08:32.544
personal stakes in the disputes but were

00:08:32.594 --> 00:08:35.224
often recruited to carry out violent

00:08:35.234 --> 00:08:38.684
acts, driven by the promise of status

00:08:38.724 --> 00:08:41.784
and money. Compared to previous periods,

00:08:42.084 --> 00:08:44.264
there seems to have been a devaluation

00:08:44.554 --> 00:08:47.164
in the status of executing certain types

00:08:47.164 --> 00:08:49.604
of shootings, with younger individuals

00:08:49.834 --> 00:08:51.714
with limited experience from the

00:08:51.734 --> 00:08:54.854
criminal milieu taking in these tasks.”

00:08:55.914 --> 00:08:56.564
End quote.

00:08:57.204 --> 00:09:00.274
In other words, these young people, boys

00:09:00.274 --> 00:09:03.244
mainly, would carry out contracts on

00:09:03.244 --> 00:09:06.074
behalf of gangs, killing members of rival

00:09:06.074 --> 00:09:09.414
gangs, or even their families, for cash.

00:09:10.754 --> 00:09:13.314
In interviews, young people are

00:09:13.364 --> 00:09:15.854
often very open about what is offered

00:09:15.924 --> 00:09:17.984
to them, usually coming through

00:09:18.224 --> 00:09:20.464
encrypted messaging apps and even

00:09:20.464 --> 00:09:23.924
social media: €5,000 for shooting

00:09:23.924 --> 00:09:27.134
someone in the leg, €15,000 to kill.

00:09:27.884 --> 00:09:30.864
The offer is placed, a job accepted,

00:09:31.294 --> 00:09:33.144
and the child is then given the

00:09:33.154 --> 00:09:36.044
name and details of the target, and

00:09:36.194 --> 00:09:38.464
provided with a weapon to commit the

00:09:38.464 --> 00:09:41.894
deed, often with an apparent complete

00:09:41.934 --> 00:09:44.304
indifference to its consequences.

00:09:45.484 --> 00:09:47.864
In the case of the 13-year-old

00:09:48.044 --> 00:09:50.094
suspected of having shot six people

00:09:50.274 --> 00:09:53.234
in early October, his social worker

00:09:53.504 --> 00:09:55.514
had asked him where he was, because

00:09:55.734 --> 00:09:57.574
they suspected he might have got

00:09:57.604 --> 00:09:59.854
involved in the wrong circles.

00:10:00.664 --> 00:10:03.114
And he reportedly texted back

00:10:03.114 --> 00:10:05.299
with “check the news, hehe”.

00:10:06.489 --> 00:10:09.144
Now, why are kids getting

00:10:09.154 --> 00:10:10.714
drawn into the world of crime?

00:10:11.224 --> 00:10:13.584
Well, the primary motivation

00:10:13.814 --> 00:10:15.444
seems to be financial.

00:10:16.114 --> 00:10:18.514
Criminal gangs are not only offering

00:10:18.524 --> 00:10:20.634
large amounts of money, but also

00:10:20.844 --> 00:10:23.264
posting on social media about what

00:10:23.294 --> 00:10:26.374
this money brings: cars, designer

00:10:26.374 --> 00:10:28.734
clothes, and the latest electronics.

00:10:29.694 --> 00:10:31.544
And most of these teenage

00:10:31.544 --> 00:10:33.724
criminals are coming from worlds

00:10:33.944 --> 00:10:36.044
where this seems out of reach.

00:10:37.214 --> 00:10:39.244
Although the Swedish police doesn’t

00:10:39.254 --> 00:10:41.844
release statistics on the backgrounds

00:10:42.084 --> 00:10:44.344
of those charged with or suspected of

00:10:44.344 --> 00:10:47.554
crime–especially minors–the trend is

00:10:47.814 --> 00:10:50.624
that these children typically come from

00:10:50.634 --> 00:10:53.094
second-generation immigrant backgrounds,

00:10:53.354 --> 00:10:55.944
often with parents on low incomes.

00:10:56.794 --> 00:10:59.234
To these children, entering the

00:10:59.234 --> 00:11:02.434
criminal world offers an easy ticket to

00:11:02.434 --> 00:11:05.594
riches, one job, just an hour’s work,

00:11:05.824 --> 00:11:08.174
and you can get paid more than your

00:11:08.174 --> 00:11:11.084
entire family might make in a year.

00:11:12.354 --> 00:11:15.304
It is, on one level, unsurprising

00:11:15.534 --> 00:11:17.294
that someone in such a situation

00:11:17.574 --> 00:11:19.654
might be tempted by such an offer.

00:11:20.561 --> 00:11:23.544
But this is not a uniquely Swedish

00:11:23.554 --> 00:11:26.394
situation; the world over, criminal

00:11:26.394 --> 00:11:29.204
gangs use children to carry out tasks

00:11:29.214 --> 00:11:32.014
for them, from carrying drugs to

00:11:32.234 --> 00:11:35.504
hiding weapons, and the offer of quick

00:11:35.554 --> 00:11:37.954
and easy money is as attractive to

00:11:37.954 --> 00:11:40.884
a boy in Stockholm as in São Paulo.

00:11:41.494 --> 00:11:43.744
So, what’s different about Sweden?

00:11:44.404 --> 00:11:47.764
Well, according to some commentators, this

00:11:47.794 --> 00:11:50.564
is a problem deeply linked to immigration.

00:11:51.324 --> 00:11:54.204
Until fairly recently, Sweden had

00:11:54.204 --> 00:11:56.594
a very generous immigration policy,

00:11:56.864 --> 00:11:58.854
and hundreds of thousands of people

00:11:59.154 --> 00:12:01.324
immigrated to the country, often

00:12:01.584 --> 00:12:03.584
from countries ravaged by war.

00:12:04.874 --> 00:12:07.324
Integrating these immigrants has not been

00:12:07.354 --> 00:12:10.484
easy, and there is no Swedish politician,

00:12:10.784 --> 00:12:13.244
to my knowledge, who says integration has

00:12:13.244 --> 00:12:16.404
been a resounding success; on the left,

00:12:16.784 --> 00:12:18.694
politicians admit that there is still

00:12:18.694 --> 00:12:21.604
a lot of work to do, and on the right,

00:12:21.814 --> 00:12:24.224
especially the further right, there are

00:12:24.224 --> 00:12:26.664
those who wish to paint immigrants as

00:12:26.664 --> 00:12:28.934
the source of all Sweden’s problems.

00:12:30.174 --> 00:12:33.034
On one level, life as an immigrant is

00:12:33.074 --> 00:12:35.804
easier in Sweden than in most countries.

00:12:36.254 --> 00:12:38.614
The state provides you with free

00:12:38.624 --> 00:12:41.334
healthcare, childcare, school and

00:12:41.334 --> 00:12:43.934
university, benefits if you are unable

00:12:43.934 --> 00:12:46.984
to find work, and housing if you need it.

00:12:47.914 --> 00:12:50.384
Unlike some countries, in Sweden,

00:12:50.734 --> 00:12:52.604
nobody should ever be forced

00:12:52.614 --> 00:12:55.224
to live in abject poverty, as

00:12:55.374 --> 00:12:57.288
the state will provide for you.

00:12:58.391 --> 00:13:01.484
But many immigrants report feeling that

00:13:01.484 --> 00:13:04.154
they are treated as second-class citizens.

00:13:04.604 --> 00:13:07.044
They live in ghettoised areas where

00:13:07.314 --> 00:13:10.204
few people speak Swedish, so they have

00:13:10.404 --> 00:13:12.634
limited chance to learn the language.

00:13:13.124 --> 00:13:15.914
They cannot find work, and do not

00:13:15.914 --> 00:13:18.004
feel like this will ever change.

00:13:18.964 --> 00:13:21.134
And it is these people’s children,

00:13:21.454 --> 00:13:23.874
typically, children who were born in

00:13:23.874 --> 00:13:27.114
Sweden, but to immigrant parents, who tend

00:13:27.344 --> 00:13:29.304
to be the ones picking up the weapons.

00:13:29.934 --> 00:13:32.594
They see their parents, uncles, aunties,

00:13:32.594 --> 00:13:35.934
and cousins, and don’t see any way out.

00:13:36.474 --> 00:13:37.984
This makes them easy

00:13:37.984 --> 00:13:39.384
targets for criminals.

00:13:40.494 --> 00:13:42.584
But, again, this is not a

00:13:42.584 --> 00:13:44.514
uniquely Swedish problem.

00:13:44.984 --> 00:13:47.184
Many other European countries have

00:13:47.204 --> 00:13:49.514
similar levels of immigration, similar

00:13:49.724 --> 00:13:52.864
problems with integration, and haven’t

00:13:52.864 --> 00:13:55.724
seen a consequent rise in gun violence.

00:13:56.344 --> 00:14:00.374
So, yes, it may be a factor, but we

00:14:00.374 --> 00:14:02.324
need to look at what else there may be.

00:14:03.174 --> 00:14:05.964
One thing that is more unique to Sweden

00:14:06.334 --> 00:14:09.064
is that it has a particularly forgiving

00:14:09.114 --> 00:14:11.554
justice system when it comes to children.

00:14:12.624 --> 00:14:15.244
Of course, in most countries, children

00:14:15.504 --> 00:14:17.624
are treated differently from adults,

00:14:17.884 --> 00:14:21.084
but Sweden is particularly lenient:

00:14:21.804 --> 00:14:25.634
children under the age of 15 cannot be

00:14:25.634 --> 00:14:28.344
tried in court, no matter what they do.

00:14:29.324 --> 00:14:33.804
Even between the ages of 15 and 17, prison

00:14:34.234 --> 00:14:37.964
is seen as an absolute last resort, and

00:14:38.224 --> 00:14:40.864
they are usually sent to social services.

00:14:41.854 --> 00:14:43.474
And it doesn’t stop there.

00:14:43.834 --> 00:14:47.204
Even if you’re 19 or 20, so legally

00:14:47.204 --> 00:14:49.604
an adult in most countries, the

00:14:49.604 --> 00:14:51.884
courts are still required to

00:14:51.904 --> 00:14:54.244
treat you as a “young person”.

00:14:55.104 --> 00:14:57.274
This means lighter sentences,

00:14:57.384 --> 00:14:59.704
no life imprisonment, and

00:14:59.704 --> 00:15:01.994
often, rehabilitation programmes

00:15:02.204 --> 00:15:03.994
instead of standard prison time.

00:15:05.054 --> 00:15:07.794
The idea behind all of this is

00:15:07.804 --> 00:15:10.444
simple, and in many ways admirable.

00:15:11.524 --> 00:15:14.334
The Swedish justice system believes that

00:15:14.344 --> 00:15:17.364
young people can change, that criminal

00:15:17.364 --> 00:15:20.644
behaviour as a child is often a sign of

00:15:20.644 --> 00:15:24.194
social problems, not of inherent evil.

00:15:24.904 --> 00:15:27.584
Poverty, unstable families, poor

00:15:27.604 --> 00:15:29.844
schooling, these aren’t a child’s

00:15:29.854 --> 00:15:33.454
fault, and it is these that push a child

00:15:33.524 --> 00:15:35.884
towards crime, so the argument goes.

00:15:37.134 --> 00:15:40.024
So the role of the state is to

00:15:40.024 --> 00:15:42.744
rehabilitate, not to punish.

00:15:43.774 --> 00:15:45.644
But there’s a problem.

00:15:46.594 --> 00:15:50.024
This lenient and forgiving system was

00:15:50.064 --> 00:15:53.164
designed for the occasional teenage

00:15:53.164 --> 00:15:55.794
troublemaker: the boy who steals a

00:15:55.814 --> 00:15:58.004
bike or gets into fights at school.

00:15:58.394 --> 00:15:59.904
It wasn’t designed for a

00:15:59.924 --> 00:16:02.417
generation of teenage hitmen.

00:16:03.604 --> 00:16:06.504
And gangs have quickly figured out

00:16:06.784 --> 00:16:09.614
that these lenient laws are a gift.

00:16:10.324 --> 00:16:12.674
They recruit children under the age

00:16:12.674 --> 00:16:15.594
of 15 precisely because they know

00:16:15.894 --> 00:16:17.944
those children cannot go to prison,

00:16:18.414 --> 00:16:20.884
so the children have less to fear.

00:16:21.544 --> 00:16:23.164
They’ll be back on the street

00:16:23.214 --> 00:16:25.404
within days, if not hours.

00:16:26.714 --> 00:16:29.444
For gang leaders, that makes these

00:16:29.444 --> 00:16:32.634
boys the perfect soldiers: disposable,

00:16:33.174 --> 00:16:36.364
fearless, and legally, almost untouchable.

00:16:37.614 --> 00:16:40.904
And so, a system built on compassion

00:16:41.294 --> 00:16:43.154
has become, unintentionally,

00:16:43.394 --> 00:16:45.184
a tool for exploitation.

00:16:46.144 --> 00:16:48.194
And there is another factor too,

00:16:48.704 --> 00:16:51.754
linked to immigration, but indirectly:

00:16:52.714 --> 00:16:56.014
after the Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s,

00:16:56.464 --> 00:16:59.214
Sweden welcomed tens of thousands

00:16:59.214 --> 00:17:00.974
of refugees from the Balkans.

00:17:01.884 --> 00:17:04.854
These were people fleeing brutal conflicts

00:17:04.864 --> 00:17:07.754
in Bosnia, Croatia, Serbia, and Kosovo,

00:17:08.074 --> 00:17:10.904
wars that had torn apart families,

00:17:11.084 --> 00:17:13.354
communities, and entire countries.

00:17:14.044 --> 00:17:16.424
Sweden opened its doors, as it

00:17:16.424 --> 00:17:18.544
has always done, and offered

00:17:18.544 --> 00:17:21.544
safety, housing, and the chance for

00:17:21.544 --> 00:17:24.084
refugees to rebuild their lives.

00:17:24.844 --> 00:17:28.604
But among the refugees were a minority

00:17:28.694 --> 00:17:31.804
of former soldiers, militia members, and

00:17:31.804 --> 00:17:34.024
people with links to organised crime.

00:17:35.104 --> 00:17:38.334
And after the war, the Balkan region

00:17:38.454 --> 00:17:41.384
was flooded with small arms, such as

00:17:41.454 --> 00:17:44.434
pistols, grenades, and automatic weapons.

00:17:45.114 --> 00:17:47.774
By some estimates, millions

00:17:47.964 --> 00:17:49.994
of unregistered weapons were

00:17:49.994 --> 00:17:51.794
circulating in the Balkans in

00:17:51.794 --> 00:17:53.084
the years after the conflict.

00:17:53.314 --> 00:17:56.614
In cupboards, in wardrobes, under the bed.

00:17:57.604 --> 00:18:00.934
And in the following decades, many of

00:18:00.934 --> 00:18:03.544
them would make their way into Sweden.

00:18:04.424 --> 00:18:07.204
And they still do, with one estimate

00:18:07.434 --> 00:18:10.454
suggesting that three new weapons arrive

00:18:10.484 --> 00:18:14.214
in Sweden every single day, and police

00:18:14.434 --> 00:18:17.134
often tracing the origins of firearms

00:18:17.354 --> 00:18:20.564
used in shootings back to the Balkans.

00:18:21.424 --> 00:18:23.534
This is a key reason why there

00:18:23.534 --> 00:18:25.744
are so many weapons in Sweden,

00:18:26.044 --> 00:18:28.154
compared to other Nordic countries.

00:18:28.864 --> 00:18:31.374
So, you have this array of different

00:18:31.374 --> 00:18:33.934
factors: an increasingly segmented

00:18:33.954 --> 00:18:36.494
criminal world willing to use lethal

00:18:36.504 --> 00:18:39.084
force, a pool of willing children,

00:18:39.444 --> 00:18:42.204
a lack of economic opportunities, a

00:18:42.234 --> 00:18:45.094
justice system based on rehabilitation

00:18:45.364 --> 00:18:47.864
rather than punishment, and enough

00:18:47.874 --> 00:18:50.364
weapons to form a small army.

00:18:51.594 --> 00:18:54.674
And the result, well, unfortunately, you

00:18:54.674 --> 00:18:56.684
can open the front page of any Swedish

00:18:56.684 --> 00:18:59.364
newspaper and see it almost every day.

00:19:00.394 --> 00:19:03.180
The question now is what to do about it.

00:19:03.854 --> 00:19:05.794
And this, as you might imagine,

00:19:06.074 --> 00:19:08.404
is the subject of great debate.

00:19:09.174 --> 00:19:11.534
Some believe the answer lies

00:19:11.564 --> 00:19:13.554
in getting tougher on crime.

00:19:14.564 --> 00:19:16.854
The Swedish government, which has

00:19:16.864 --> 00:19:20.624
shifted to the right after 2022, has

00:19:20.634 --> 00:19:23.634
promised what it calls “a paradigm shift”

00:19:23.844 --> 00:19:26.174
in how the country deals with crime.

00:19:27.154 --> 00:19:29.254
The Prime Minister has spoken about

00:19:29.504 --> 00:19:32.464
“breaking the gangs’ backs”, and his

00:19:32.464 --> 00:19:34.444
government has already introduced

00:19:34.474 --> 00:19:36.344
a series of measures that mark

00:19:36.364 --> 00:19:39.134
a sharp turn away from Sweden’s

00:19:39.194 --> 00:19:40.974
traditionally liberal approach.

00:19:42.154 --> 00:19:43.964
Among the most controversial

00:19:43.964 --> 00:19:46.564
proposals is to lower the age

00:19:46.574 --> 00:19:48.004
of criminal responsibility.

00:19:49.214 --> 00:19:51.294
Under the current law, as you

00:19:51.294 --> 00:19:53.854
heard, anyone under the age of

00:19:53.854 --> 00:19:56.664
15 cannot be tried or sentenced.

00:19:57.314 --> 00:20:00.754
But under new proposals, prosecutors

00:20:00.964 --> 00:20:03.264
would be able to charge younger offenders

00:20:03.394 --> 00:20:06.014
for serious crimes, such as murder,

00:20:06.344 --> 00:20:08.804
attempted murder, or bombings, with

00:20:08.804 --> 00:20:11.094
some in government pushing for children

00:20:11.134 --> 00:20:14.734
as young as 13 to be tried as adults

00:20:16.054 --> 00:20:18.304
The government has also introduced

00:20:18.504 --> 00:20:21.254
harsher penalties for crimes connected

00:20:21.264 --> 00:20:23.924
to gang networks, meaning that even

00:20:23.934 --> 00:20:26.224
being part of a criminal organisation

00:20:26.554 --> 00:20:28.294
could carry longer sentences.

00:20:29.154 --> 00:20:31.644
Police have also been given broader

00:20:31.644 --> 00:20:34.074
powers to intercept encrypted messages,

00:20:34.294 --> 00:20:36.804
use facial recognition technology, and

00:20:36.814 --> 00:20:39.804
conduct preventive searches, which allow

00:20:39.804 --> 00:20:42.594
them to stop and search people even if

00:20:42.864 --> 00:20:45.384
they’re not suspected of a specific crime.

00:20:46.624 --> 00:20:48.914
Now, critics say these measures

00:20:49.054 --> 00:20:51.444
have gone too far; they are the sort

00:20:51.444 --> 00:20:53.694
of things more commonly associated

00:20:53.884 --> 00:20:55.629
with countries like France or the

00:20:55.629 --> 00:20:58.584
UK, not famously liberal Sweden.

00:20:59.504 --> 00:21:02.464
The government, however, argues that

00:21:02.474 --> 00:21:04.994
the situation demands it; desperate

00:21:04.994 --> 00:21:07.274
times call for desperate measures.

00:21:07.794 --> 00:21:10.684
Sweden’s liberal justice system isn’t

00:21:10.764 --> 00:21:12.744
adequately equipped to deal with the

00:21:12.744 --> 00:21:14.794
level of criminality that exists today.

00:21:15.184 --> 00:21:17.454
This isn’t the time for philosophical

00:21:17.454 --> 00:21:19.284
debate about rehabilitation,

00:21:19.724 --> 00:21:21.204
so the argument goes; it’s

00:21:21.204 --> 00:21:23.154
a fight to restore order.

00:21:24.384 --> 00:21:27.184
But there is, of course, another camp.

00:21:27.884 --> 00:21:29.924
Many Swedes believe that these

00:21:29.924 --> 00:21:33.184
measures may address the symptoms of

00:21:33.184 --> 00:21:35.604
the violence, but not the root cause.

00:21:36.394 --> 00:21:39.074
Harsher punishments and police powers

00:21:39.354 --> 00:21:41.904
might make voters feel safer in the

00:21:41.904 --> 00:21:44.674
short term and put a bunch of young

00:21:44.674 --> 00:21:48.004
men behind bars, but in the long term,

00:21:48.244 --> 00:21:50.174
they aren’t really solving anything.

00:21:51.104 --> 00:21:54.044
Instead, they call for greater investment

00:21:54.314 --> 00:21:57.394
in schools, housing, and integration.

00:21:58.084 --> 00:22:00.574
In other words, tackling the reasons

00:22:00.694 --> 00:22:03.784
why these children end up in gangs in

00:22:03.784 --> 00:22:06.094
the first place, not punishing them

00:22:06.384 --> 00:22:07.754
after they’ve pulled the trigger.

00:22:08.514 --> 00:22:10.784
Using the carrot, not the stick.

00:22:11.704 --> 00:22:13.584
Now, the one thing I want to

00:22:13.614 --> 00:22:16.334
add here is my own perspective.

00:22:17.204 --> 00:22:20.504
I live in Sweden, and I often see

00:22:20.554 --> 00:22:23.104
scaremongering stories by foreign

00:22:23.104 --> 00:22:25.524
media outlets, often right-leaning

00:22:25.524 --> 00:22:28.104
ones, portraying the country as some

00:22:28.144 --> 00:22:30.904
extremely dangerous, crime-filled

00:22:30.914 --> 00:22:34.234
warzone, with immigrants as the culprits.

00:22:35.134 --> 00:22:37.164
Yes, it is frightening to think

00:22:37.174 --> 00:22:38.754
that this is happening close

00:22:38.754 --> 00:22:41.174
to where my family lives, and I

00:22:41.184 --> 00:22:42.874
certainly wish it were different.

00:22:43.744 --> 00:22:47.284
But this violence is predominantly gang

00:22:47.294 --> 00:22:51.304
on gang, and my experience so far is

00:22:51.304 --> 00:22:54.694
that cities in Sweden feel much safer

00:22:55.014 --> 00:22:56.874
than places like London or Paris.

00:22:57.594 --> 00:23:00.274
And pinning all of the blame on

00:23:00.354 --> 00:23:03.854
immigration is, in my opinion, a gross

00:23:03.864 --> 00:23:06.374
simplification of a complicated problem.

00:23:07.454 --> 00:23:09.704
To wrap things up, Sweden is

00:23:09.704 --> 00:23:11.484
a wonderful place, but it’s

00:23:11.494 --> 00:23:14.064
neither the socialist utopia nor

00:23:14.064 --> 00:23:16.144
hellhole it’s painted out to be.

00:23:16.904 --> 00:23:19.754
And, no matter their political persuasion,

00:23:20.224 --> 00:23:23.244
everyone in Sweden wants to return to

00:23:23.244 --> 00:23:26.134
a situation where shootings are not a

00:23:26.174 --> 00:23:29.174
daily occurrence, but the question of

00:23:29.174 --> 00:23:32.324
how to get there is far from resolved.

00:23:33.724 --> 00:23:35.794
OK, then, that is it for today's

00:23:35.794 --> 00:23:38.764
episode on Sweden’s Teenage Gangsters.

00:23:39.004 --> 00:23:40.274
I hope it's been an interesting one

00:23:40.624 --> 00:23:42.174

00:23:47.844 --> 00:23:49.144
have you visited Sweden?

00:23:49.314 --> 00:23:50.884
What are your thoughts on the

00:23:50.924 --> 00:23:53.014
issue, the root causes, and

00:23:53.014 --> 00:23:54.425
what can be done about it?

00:23:54.849 --> 00:23:55.979
