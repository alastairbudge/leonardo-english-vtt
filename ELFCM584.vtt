Hello, hello, hello, and welcome

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.700
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.500
Minds, by Leonardo English, the show

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:15.260
where you can listen to fascinating

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.720
stories and learn weird and wonderful

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.780
things about the world at the same

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.650
time as improving your English.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.830
I'm Alastair Budge, and today it’s

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.669
part three, the final part, of our

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.630
mini-series on the Years of Lead.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.500
In case you missed them, in part one,

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.159
we set the scene and talked about

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.320
the Piazza Fontana bombing and the

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.100
early years of this tumultuous period.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.790
In part two, we talked about the Red

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.420
Brigades and the kidnapping and murder

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.300
of the former Prime Minister, Aldo Moro.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.020
And today, we are going to bring it to

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.650
a close with the most deadly event of

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.089
the entire period: The Bologna bombing.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.470
If you haven’t listened to parts

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.880
one and two yet, I’d recommend

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.850
listening to those first, as I’ll be

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.670
referencing quite a bit from that.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.210
So, let’s not waste a minute

00:01:08.559 --> 00:01:10.420
and get right into it.

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:13.889
There are many wonderful things

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.890
about the city of Bologna: fantastic

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.649
food, a beautiful centre, a famous

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.510
university and a vibrant cultural scene.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.380
One area where Bologna doesn’t

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:28.969
score so highly, however, at least

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.039
compared to other Italian cities,

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:33.369
is its weather, its climate.

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.699
It’s in the Po valley, surrounded

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.700
by mountains on all sides.

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.930
This means winters can be cold and

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.480
damp, and in summer, it’s hot, humid and

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:50.039
sticky, making it pretty uncomfortable.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.470
Fortunately, the sea isn’t so far

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.380
away, and in the summer months, a

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.010
fair portion of the city piles into

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.909
cars, buses and trains, heading

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.380
east towards the Adriatic coast.

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:09.230
August 1980 was particularly

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:10.880
hot and unpleasant.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.920
And on the Saturday of the first weekend

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.390
of August, Saturday the 2nd, thousands

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.060
of people were piling into the train

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.249
station, no doubt looking forward

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:26.650
to a refreshing day by the sea, away

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.219
from the stifling heat of the city.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.140
The station waiting room was jam-packed:

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.840
families, children, grandparents,

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.380
people from all walks of life.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.590
None of them would catch

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:42.890
their train that day.

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.630
At precisely 10.25 am, there

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.269
was a huge explosion that ripped

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.130
through the train waiting room.

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.130
The roof collapsed.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.210
Windows were blown to smithereens.

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.409
Cars overturned.

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.640
The entire area around the

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.879
station covered in dust.

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.109
According to eyewitness accounts,

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.030
in the immediate aftermath,

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.339
there was an eerie silence.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.280
Then came the groans and

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.289
wails from under the rubble.

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.780
The shrieks of horror as people found

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.120
the lifeless bodies of loved ones.

00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:25.750
Then the sound of police

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.670
and ambulance sirens.

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.679
In total, 85 people were killed,

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.010
and more than 200 were wounded.

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.976
Initially, it was thought to have been an

00:03:38.976 --> 00:03:41.510
explosion of a gas pipe in the station,

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.860
a tragic but innocent maintenance error.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.140
Shortly afterwards, it became clear it

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.990
was something altogether more sinister.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.849
The cause was 23kg of explosives

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.270
that had been placed in a suitcase

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.400
in the waiting room, on a timer.

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.160
It would go down as the deadliest

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.350
terrorist attack not only of the

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.269
Years of Lead, but also has the grim

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.560
distinction of being the deadliest

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.130
terrorist attack in Italian history.

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.029
And to make matters worse, nobody

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.950
has ever formally admitted to it,

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.820
and many people believe that the

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.540
true culprits have never been found.

00:04:29.679 --> 00:04:32.349
It is, like the Piazza Fontana bombing

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.220
and the kidnapping of Aldo Moro

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.460
before it, one of those incidents

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.822
where there is an official verdict,

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.510
a legally guilty party, but there

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.819
is a common belief that the whole

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.500
story has never really come to light.

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.820
So, let us remind ourselves a little bit

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:54.818
about the Years of Lead up to this point.

00:04:55.897 --> 00:04:59.000
By the summer of 1980, Italy

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.810
had lived through more than a

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:03.090
decade of political violence.

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.229
It had started, as we talked

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:07.900
about in part one, with the

00:05:07.929 --> 00:05:10.830
Piazza Fontana bombing in 1969.

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.140
That attack opened a grim new chapter

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:17.320
in Italian history, where political

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.280
violence became an almost daily reality.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.480
There were clashes in the streets,

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:26.310
bombs on trains, shootings, and

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.991
kidnappings, and by the mid-1970s,

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:33.150
Italy was experiencing hundreds of

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:35.480
acts of political violence every year.

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.080
Then came the kidnapping and

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:42.460
murder of Aldo Moro in 1978,

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:44.699
which we explored in part two.

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:49.000
Moro’s death marked a turning point.

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.610
The dream of the “historic compromise”

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.590
between the Christian Democrats

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:56.590
and the Communists collapsed.

00:05:57.219 --> 00:05:59.370
The Red Brigades, who had staged

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.289
the kidnapping, believed they were

00:06:01.299 --> 00:06:03.410
striking a blow against the state,

00:06:03.959 --> 00:06:06.210
but instead they found themselves

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:08.980
increasingly isolated, hunted down by

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:11.570
police, and losing public sympathy.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.080
And within a few years, they

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.620
would be completely dismantled.

00:06:17.559 --> 00:06:21.019
But that didn’t mean the violence stopped.

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:23.930
If anything, it shifted shape.

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:27.500
On the far left, there were still

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.159
extremist groups carrying out targeted

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:33.250
assassinations, mostly against judges,

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:35.700
journalists, and business leaders.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.719
On the far right, neofascist organisations

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:42.270
continued their strategy of bombings,

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.630
aiming to create fear and instability,

00:06:46.039 --> 00:06:48.830
to push Italy towards authoritarian rule.

00:06:49.959 --> 00:06:52.409
As you may recall, this was part of what

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:55.249
later came to be called the strategy of

00:06:55.349 --> 00:06:58.499
tension: the belief that terrorism itself

00:06:58.679 --> 00:07:01.739
could be used, or tolerated by elements

00:07:01.739 --> 00:07:04.280
of the state, to push Italy away from

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.359
the left and towards authoritarian rule.

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:13.019
So by 1980, Italy was a country still

00:07:13.049 --> 00:07:16.150
deeply scarred, still fearful, still

00:07:16.169 --> 00:07:18.960
accustomed to waking up to headlines

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:22.240
about kidnappings, bombs and bloodshed.

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:25.689
Yet nothing could have prepared

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:27.539
it for the horror of Bologna.

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:31.179
See, despite the almost daily

00:07:31.179 --> 00:07:33.099
political violence, this was

00:07:33.109 --> 00:07:35.650
typically violence against policians

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:37.840
or people in positions of power.

00:07:38.489 --> 00:07:40.880
Or between rival political groups;

00:07:40.959 --> 00:07:43.180
the left against the right, and

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:44.510
in fact much more frequently,

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:46.090
the right against the left.

00:07:46.859 --> 00:07:50.169
Of course, these are generalisations, and

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:52.439
you’d also have factions on both sides

00:07:52.469 --> 00:07:55.550
even fighting each other, but the point is

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:58.480
that the violence wasn’t typically against

00:07:58.579 --> 00:08:01.590
“civilians”, regular, ordinary people.

00:08:02.849 --> 00:08:06.099
Bologna was different; it didn’t target

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:08.910
politicians, judges, or symbols of

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:12.620
power, it was aimed squarely at ordinary

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:16.300
people: families, children, pensioners,

00:08:16.706 --> 00:08:18.940
holidaymakers waiting for trains.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.119
It wasn’t just another strike in

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:24.209
Italy’s political war; it was an

00:08:24.209 --> 00:08:27.090
attack on Italian society itself.

00:08:29.289 --> 00:08:31.489
As you can imagine, in the hours

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:33.449
and days after the explosion,

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:36.109
Bologna became a city of grief.

00:08:37.189 --> 00:08:38.650
The President travelled to

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:40.539
the city almost immediately.

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:43.330
He walked among the rubble of the

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:45.700
station, spoke to the wounded in

00:08:45.709 --> 00:08:48.710
hospitals, and delivered an emotional

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:51.470
appeal for unity against terrorism.

00:08:52.403 --> 00:08:55.000
Pertini, the President, was an old

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:58.029
partisan fighter, a man who had resisted

00:08:58.039 --> 00:09:01.169
Mussolini, and his presence gave a

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:03.380
sense of dignity to the mourning.

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:07.134
The funerals were held in Bologna’s

00:09:07.134 --> 00:09:09.079
Piazza Maggiore, the great

00:09:09.079 --> 00:09:10.970
square at the heart of the city.

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:14.310
Thousands upon thousands of people

00:09:14.699 --> 00:09:17.890
stood in silence, clutching photographs,

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:21.940
waving black flags, demanding justice.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.689
But justice for whom?

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:30.139
No group has ever claimed responsibility

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:32.990
for the attack, and the list of potential

00:09:32.999 --> 00:09:36.159
culprits, well it was depressingly long.

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:39.760
On the far left, the Red Brigades

00:09:39.939 --> 00:09:42.050
had not yet been completely crushed,

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:45.140
and their willingness to kill for

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:47.969
political ends, well after Aldo Moro,

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:50.350
that was evident for anyone to see.

00:09:51.199 --> 00:09:54.229
On the far right, neofascist groups had

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.090
carried out a string of bombings in Milan

00:09:57.090 --> 00:10:00.280
and Brescia, and even attacks on trains.

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:03.140
Almost immediately, the finger

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.279
of blame was pointed in both

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.230
these very different directions.

00:10:08.319 --> 00:10:11.000
Some officials and newspapers suggested

00:10:11.069 --> 00:10:13.560
leftist anarchists must be responsible,

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.490
as they had done after Piazza Fontana.

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:19.739
For many, especially after Aldo

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:22.240
Moro just two years before, the

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.190
idea that anarchists were behind

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:26.680
Bologna seemed to fit perfectly.

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.240
But there was no evidence

00:10:29.289 --> 00:10:30.780
linking them to the attack.

00:10:31.599 --> 00:10:34.580
Attention soon shifted to the far

00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:37.800
right, in particular to a group known

00:10:37.819 --> 00:10:40.930
as the Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari, or

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:44.000
NAR for short, the Armed Revolutionary

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.120
Nuclei, as they’re called in English.

00:10:47.319 --> 00:10:50.139
This was a violent neofascist

00:10:50.179 --> 00:10:52.349
organisation, formed by young

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.770
extremists who rejected mainstream

00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:56.710
politics and embraced terror.

00:10:57.449 --> 00:10:59.880
They had links to older neo-fascist

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:02.199
movements and were already suspected

00:11:02.199 --> 00:11:04.850
of earlier attacks, and their

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:07.069
fingerprints were all over Bologna.

00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:10.839
But the investigation was

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:12.860
messy from the very beginning.

00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:14.700
Files disappeared.

00:11:15.079 --> 00:11:17.020
Evidence was mishandled.

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:19.889
Suspects slipped through the cracks.

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:23.979
Two people were eventually

00:11:24.119 --> 00:11:26.424
convicted of the bombing: Valerio

00:11:26.424 --> 00:11:28.699
Fioravanti and Francesca Mambro.

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:33.129
In Fioravanti’s case, he was sentenced

00:11:33.329 --> 00:11:37.430
to 10 consecutive life sentences plus

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:43.069
250 years in prison, but he ended up only

00:11:43.069 --> 00:11:45.935
serving a fraction of that; he was allowed

00:11:45.935 --> 00:11:49.495
out on day release in the year 2000, and

00:11:49.745 --> 00:11:53.225
has been a completely free man since 2009.

00:11:54.195 --> 00:11:56.795
Even for Italy’s famously forgiving

00:11:56.795 --> 00:11:59.585
justice system, this was a remarkably

00:11:59.595 --> 00:12:02.115
short stint in prison, given the gravity

00:12:02.115 --> 00:12:03.915
of the crimes he was convicted of.

00:12:05.225 --> 00:12:08.655
Now, for their part, Fioravanti and Mambro

00:12:08.845 --> 00:12:11.155
have always maintained their innocence.

00:12:11.625 --> 00:12:13.775
They admit to their involvement with

00:12:13.775 --> 00:12:17.085
NAR, having been far-right activists and

00:12:17.095 --> 00:12:20.145
being behind other attacks, but say that

00:12:20.155 --> 00:12:22.875
they weren’t responsible for Bologna.

00:12:24.055 --> 00:12:26.822
So if Valerio Fioravanti and

00:12:26.822 --> 00:12:29.385
Francesca Mambro had nothing to do

00:12:29.385 --> 00:12:31.915
with it, or if they were too young

00:12:31.925 --> 00:12:34.305
and unconnected to have been able to

00:12:34.305 --> 00:12:37.365
do it alone, who else was behind it?

00:12:38.245 --> 00:12:41.145
Well, again, this is where it's easy to

00:12:41.145 --> 00:12:43.225
go down rabbit hole after rabbit hole

00:12:43.465 --> 00:12:45.575
of Years of Lead conspiracy theories,

00:12:45.675 --> 00:12:48.215
which lead to masonic lodges, the

00:12:48.215 --> 00:12:51.225
mafia, Gladio, the “stay behind” NATO

00:12:51.225 --> 00:12:54.085
operation, and even to Carlos The Jackal,

00:12:54.355 --> 00:12:56.665
the Venezuelan political terrorist.

00:12:57.775 --> 00:13:01.065
See, the more the investigation unfolded,

00:13:01.515 --> 00:13:04.415
the less clear things seemed to become.

00:13:05.375 --> 00:13:08.175
Judges complained of obstruction from

00:13:08.185 --> 00:13:10.655
within the Italian secret services.

00:13:11.055 --> 00:13:14.145
Evidence went missing, false leads were

00:13:14.145 --> 00:13:17.325
planted, and witnesses were intimidated.

00:13:18.365 --> 00:13:20.465
It was as if someone wanted

00:13:20.465 --> 00:13:22.575
the truth buried under the

00:13:22.575 --> 00:13:24.275
rubble of Bologna’s station.

00:13:25.885 --> 00:13:27.905
And the evidence from earlier

00:13:27.905 --> 00:13:29.585
attacks suggested that this

00:13:29.585 --> 00:13:31.485
was not just a paranoid theory.

00:13:32.325 --> 00:13:34.875
By this time, investigations into

00:13:34.875 --> 00:13:36.825
the Piazza Fontana bombing and

00:13:36.825 --> 00:13:39.275
others had uncovered links between

00:13:39.275 --> 00:13:41.495
far-right terrorists and elements

00:13:41.525 --> 00:13:43.175
of the Italian secret services.

00:13:43.795 --> 00:13:46.715
There were cases where extremists were

00:13:46.735 --> 00:13:49.505
tipped off before arrests, or evidence was

00:13:49.505 --> 00:13:51.965
destroyed to throw judges off the scent.

00:13:53.505 --> 00:13:55.735
And the Bologna bombing fit

00:13:55.795 --> 00:13:58.285
perfectly into this dark pattern.

00:13:59.535 --> 00:14:03.245
So when judges pointed to NAR as the

00:14:03.265 --> 00:14:05.501
culprits, and later on, when Fioravanti

00:14:05.501 --> 00:14:08.815
and Mambro were released after only

00:14:08.815 --> 00:14:10.965
serving a small portion of their sentence,

00:14:11.405 --> 00:14:13.745
many Italians were left wondering.

00:14:14.705 --> 00:14:15.901
Were Fioravanti and

00:14:15.901 --> 00:14:17.635
Mambro really behind it?

00:14:17.898 --> 00:14:20.915
Were they simply pawns in a larger game?

00:14:22.465 --> 00:14:24.535
The investigation into the Bologna

00:14:24.535 --> 00:14:27.015
bombing has dragged on for decades.

00:14:27.645 --> 00:14:29.445
Fioravanti and Mambro had been

00:14:29.445 --> 00:14:32.145
in custody since 1981, the

00:14:32.145 --> 00:14:33.255
year following the bombing.

00:14:33.615 --> 00:14:36.595
It took until 1988 for them,

00:14:36.895 --> 00:14:38.465
along with several other members

00:14:38.465 --> 00:14:40.155
of the NAR, to be sentenced.

00:14:40.435 --> 00:14:43.065
But, still, this wasn’t the end of it.

00:14:43.475 --> 00:14:45.805
There were also convictions of secret

00:14:45.805 --> 00:14:48.015
service officials for obstruction

00:14:48.015 --> 00:14:50.425
of justice, accused of deliberately

00:14:50.445 --> 00:14:51.905
derailing the investigation.

00:14:52.475 --> 00:14:55.085
Appeals, retrials, and new

00:14:55.085 --> 00:14:57.225
verdicts followed for years.

00:14:57.805 --> 00:15:02.035
Even into the 2000s and 2010s, courts

00:15:02.265 --> 00:15:05.725
continued to re-examine evidence, uncover

00:15:05.915 --> 00:15:08.985
hidden documents, and issue new rulings.

00:15:10.045 --> 00:15:13.265
The result was a long, confusing

00:15:13.325 --> 00:15:15.765
judicial saga that left many

00:15:15.765 --> 00:15:18.065
Italians unconvinced that the

00:15:18.065 --> 00:15:20.615
full truth had ever come to light.

00:15:22.105 --> 00:15:24.565
Now, if you take a train from Bologna

00:15:24.605 --> 00:15:26.945
train station today, you might not

00:15:26.975 --> 00:15:29.555
immediately see any sign that this

00:15:29.555 --> 00:15:31.835
was not so long ago the site of

00:15:31.855 --> 00:15:33.865
Italy’s most deadly terrorist attack.

00:15:34.795 --> 00:15:36.515
But if you look up at the

00:15:36.515 --> 00:15:38.125
clock, you’ll notice something.

00:15:39.045 --> 00:15:42.525
It is stuck at precisely 10.25

00:15:42.525 --> 00:15:45.215
am, the very moment of the blast.

00:15:46.645 --> 00:15:49.415
Somehow, the original clock wasn’t

00:15:49.435 --> 00:15:52.165
completely destroyed; it remained stuck

00:15:52.185 --> 00:15:55.735
there, forever frozen in time, like the

00:15:55.735 --> 00:15:58.285
85 people who lost their lives that day.

00:15:59.735 --> 00:16:02.385
If there is anything good to be taken

00:16:02.395 --> 00:16:05.405
from this tragedy, it’s that it marked

00:16:05.465 --> 00:16:07.225
the worst point of The Years of Lead.

00:16:08.155 --> 00:16:10.565
There were still isolated killings

00:16:10.575 --> 00:16:12.845
throughout the 1980s, but the

00:16:12.855 --> 00:16:14.985
era of constant bombings and

00:16:15.115 --> 00:16:17.915
spectacular acts of terror was over.

00:16:19.095 --> 00:16:21.425
After the best part of two decades,

00:16:21.755 --> 00:16:24.415
political violence–both by the right

00:16:24.615 --> 00:16:27.355
and the left–had failed to achieve

00:16:27.375 --> 00:16:30.145
its stated goals, and public support

00:16:30.355 --> 00:16:33.415
on both sides was at all-time lows.

00:16:34.745 --> 00:16:36.655
But the shadow of those

00:16:36.655 --> 00:16:38.825
years still hangs over Italy.

00:16:39.445 --> 00:16:42.695
The violence left scars: deep mistrust

00:16:42.915 --> 00:16:45.365
of institutions, a political culture

00:16:45.635 --> 00:16:48.615
where conspiracy theories thrive, and

00:16:49.005 --> 00:16:51.665
a lingering sense that the state has

00:16:51.665 --> 00:16:53.445
not told its people the full story.

00:16:55.085 --> 00:16:57.595
And as for Italian politics today?

00:16:58.255 --> 00:17:00.325
The Christian Democrats, which had

00:17:00.335 --> 00:17:02.245
dominated the country during the Years

00:17:02.245 --> 00:17:04.925
of Lead, no longer exist as a party.

00:17:05.685 --> 00:17:07.605
The Communist Party, once the

00:17:07.605 --> 00:17:10.115
largest in the West, is also gone.

00:17:11.715 --> 00:17:13.825
And the Italian political scene

00:17:14.135 --> 00:17:15.835
is not much less fragmented.

00:17:16.355 --> 00:17:19.045
There were 15 different political parties

00:17:19.305 --> 00:17:22.135
in the 2022 election, the most popular

00:17:22.135 --> 00:17:25.235
of which was Fratelli d’Italia, a party

00:17:25.385 --> 00:17:27.885
with roots in the post-fascist right.

00:17:29.105 --> 00:17:31.305
And of course, this is all very

00:17:31.305 --> 00:17:34.615
recent stuff: Giorgia Meloni, almost

00:17:34.645 --> 00:17:36.455
every member of her government,

00:17:36.755 --> 00:17:40.165
and any Italian over the age of 45

00:17:40.465 --> 00:17:42.835
was alive during the Years of Lead.

00:17:44.085 --> 00:17:46.975
So, these memories, whether they

00:17:46.975 --> 00:17:49.685
are first-hand from people who were

00:17:50.065 --> 00:17:52.175
teenager activists during the Years

00:17:52.175 --> 00:17:55.075
of Lead, or, like Meloni, their

00:17:55.235 --> 00:17:58.015
memories are likely second-hand, from

00:17:58.215 --> 00:18:00.865
parents and older relatives, well

00:18:01.295 --> 00:18:03.995
they are still fresh, and are part

00:18:03.995 --> 00:18:06.795
of the political DNA of modern Italy.

00:18:08.715 --> 00:18:11.985
Now, to wrap up Bologna, and indeed

00:18:12.015 --> 00:18:14.415
this entire mini-series, it’s very

00:18:14.415 --> 00:18:18.215
easy to visit Italy and get distracted

00:18:18.285 --> 00:18:20.275
by the beautiful city centres,

00:18:20.675 --> 00:18:23.355
art, history, and restaurants.

00:18:23.975 --> 00:18:26.575
You probably don’t think of bombs,

00:18:27.025 --> 00:18:29.715
kidnappings, and murder, or if you

00:18:29.715 --> 00:18:32.535
do, it’s in the context of organised

00:18:32.565 --> 00:18:35.035
criminals, not political actors.

00:18:36.355 --> 00:18:39.045
The story of The Years of Lead isn’t very

00:18:39.045 --> 00:18:42.655
often told outside Italy, but it is as

00:18:42.655 --> 00:18:46.205
fascinating as it is confusing and murky.

00:18:47.065 --> 00:18:50.515
It’s hard to understand, partly because

00:18:50.515 --> 00:18:53.725
there was no clear, unifying, villain.

00:18:54.335 --> 00:18:57.485
There wasn’t a single external, foreign

00:18:57.515 --> 00:18:59.775
enemy plotting to destroy Italy.

00:19:00.235 --> 00:19:03.635
The violence came from within, by people

00:19:03.825 --> 00:19:05.885
who were convinced that they were acting

00:19:05.895 --> 00:19:08.245
in the best interests of their country.

00:19:08.965 --> 00:19:11.555
The bombers, the kidnappers, the police,

00:19:11.715 --> 00:19:14.515
the politicians — they all believed, in

00:19:14.515 --> 00:19:17.335
some warped way, that they were defending

00:19:17.335 --> 00:19:20.265
the Republic, protecting freedom, fighting

00:19:20.265 --> 00:19:22.875
for workers’ rights, or preserving order.

00:19:24.295 --> 00:19:26.745
It is perhaps a reminder that when

00:19:26.745 --> 00:19:28.945
it comes to political violence,

00:19:29.165 --> 00:19:31.115
there are rarely any winners.

00:19:33.115 --> 00:19:35.135
OK, then, that is it for today's

00:19:35.155 --> 00:19:37.115
episode on the Bologna bombings,

00:19:37.285 --> 00:19:39.585
and with that comes an end to this

00:19:39.605 --> 00:19:41.435
three-part mini-series on this

00:19:41.435 --> 00:19:43.665
fascinating but haunting period of

00:19:43.665 --> 00:19:45.885
Italian history, the years of lead.

00:19:46.535 --> 00:19:48.485
If you’ve made it this far, let me tell

00:19:48.485 --> 00:19:50.495
you something that might be interesting.

00:19:50.915 --> 00:19:52.795
I spent quite a lot of my last year

00:19:52.795 --> 00:19:55.305
at university studying this period,

00:19:55.605 --> 00:19:58.525
and my professor was a guy called John

00:19:58.525 --> 00:20:01.225
Foot, who is, incidentally, probably

00:20:01.235 --> 00:20:03.135
the best-known English-language

00:20:03.135 --> 00:20:04.975
historian on the Years of Lead.

00:20:05.515 --> 00:20:07.325
I never imagined that the courses

00:20:07.345 --> 00:20:09.815
I did would have any practical use,

00:20:09.995 --> 00:20:12.465
but almost 20 years later, they

00:20:12.465 --> 00:20:14.135
were more useful than I thought.

00:20:14.925 --> 00:20:16.825
You've been listening to English Learning

00:20:16.825 --> 00:20:19.495
for Curious Minds by Leonardo English.

00:20:19.915 --> 00:20:22.545
I'm Alastair Budge, you stay safe, and

00:20:22.545 --> 00:20:24.795
I'll catch you in the next episode.
