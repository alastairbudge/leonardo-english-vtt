Hello, hello, hello, and welcome

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.090
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:12.890
Minds, by Leonardo English, the show

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.820
where you can listen to fascinating

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.390
stories and learn weird and wonderful

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.450
things about the world at the same

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:21.290
time as improving your English.

00:00:21.809 --> 00:00:24.810
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.160
going to be talking about The Unabomber.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.890
It's a story of genius, terrorism,

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.879
isolation, technology, mathematics, and

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.920
the most expensive manhunt in FBI history.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.720
OK then, let's not waste a

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.236
minute and get right into it.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.410
The 19th of September, 1995, was a

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:52.993
busy day for American newsstands.

00:00:53.419 --> 00:00:55.830
From the early morning, up and down

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.700
the country, queues snaked around

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.010
the block as people waited in

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.890
line for their chance to read what

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:07.440
promised to be a bombshell story.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.070
The Washington Post and the New York

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.260
Times had announced that they were going

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.120
to publish, in full, the manifesto of

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.450
a terrorist killer known only as The

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.160
Unabomber, a name that came from the

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:27.620
FBI’s internal code ‘UNABOM’, short

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.800
for university and airline bombings..

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.390
This decision to publish was

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.130
unusual for several reasons.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.950
Firstly, newspapers don’t tend

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.593
to publish terrorist manifestos.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.889
The US government has a stated policy

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.490
of not cooperating with terrorists,

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.930
and so agreeing to publish one’s

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.610
manifesto was unusual, to say the least.

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.610
Secondly, the manifesto

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:01.769
was 35,000 words long.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.680
Not exactly coffee shop reading.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.560
Thirdly, this manifesto was the

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.770
first time the general public had

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.030
heard anything from the Unabomber.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.259
For 17 years he had been sending

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.690
anonymous bombs, and this was the first

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:24.649
time not just the public, but also

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.800
the authorities, would understand why.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.500
The agreement to publish the manifesto,

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.490
made with the full approval of the

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.250
FBI, was a sign of desperation.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.620
Whoever the Unabomber was, he had

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.180
managed to elude the authorities

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.420
for the best part of two decades.

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.240
His bombing campaign had started

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.400
in 1978, and had continued, off and

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.020
on, until 1995, killing 3 people

00:02:58.339 --> 00:03:01.323
and injuring an additional 23.

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:06.180
And for the duration of the campaign, he

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.150
had never made any requests, not a single

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.719
demand, nor had he officially claimed

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.430
responsibility for any of the attacks.

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.560
To state the obvious, this is very

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.760
unusual; typically a terrorist, or

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.040
a terrorist group, will put forward

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.430
demands, or at least they will come

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.040
forward and claim responsibility for an

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.230
attack, to try to pressurise a government

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.269
into taking a particular action.

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:36.990
The Unabomber had done

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.620
none of those things.

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:40.400
Until now.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.060
Earlier that year, earlier in 1995,

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.820
he had written a letter to The New

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.040
York Times promising to stop the

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.880
bombings if either the Times or the

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.480
Washington Post published his manifesto.

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.690
When this request was taken to the

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.950
FBI, it was carefully considered.

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.080
Sure, the United States does

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.550
not cooperate with terrorists.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.120
But this wasn’t exactly an impossible

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.770
demand to agree to; he wasn’t asking

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.320
for prisoners to be released or for

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.020
any major change to government policy.

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.470
All he wanted was for his views to

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.519
be published in a major newspaper.

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:29.690
What’s more, after 17 years and

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.020
thousands of false leads, the

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.380
FBI was at something of a loss.

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.000
The bomber had taken meticulous care

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.530
to cover his tracks, all sorts of

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.219
psychological profiles had proven to

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:47.509
be fruitless, and despite spending

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.950
today’s equivalent of more than

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.300
$100 million on the investigation,

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.360
they were no closer to finding him.

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.640
So the publication of the manifesto was

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.070
a gamble—one last attempt to provoke a

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.630
reaction, to coax the killer into making a

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.500
mistake, or to encourage someone, anyone,

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.680
to recognise the voice behind the words.

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.350
Perhaps, just perhaps, someone might

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:20.400
read this manifesto and something might

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.810
click; a professor reading the style of

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.660
a former student or a parent recognising

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.690
their child’s voice from the page.

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.590
If it didn’t work, well, this would

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.570
be highly embarrassing for the FBI,

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:39.260
but they had run out of other options.

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:43.480
The manifesto began with the

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.780
now famous line: “The Industrial

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.590
Revolution and its consequences have

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:52.390
been a disaster for the human race."

00:05:53.429 --> 00:05:56.860
And over the next 35,000 words or so,

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:00.779
it went on to spell out its author’s

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:03.670
worldview, and it was a worldview

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.810
unlike anything most readers had ever

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.070
seen printed in a daily newspaper.

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:13.143
It was bleak, uncompromising,

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.150
and fiercely argued.

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.690
The anonymous author—who signed his

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:23.330
letters as “FC”, short for Freedom Club—he

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.320
believed that modern technological society

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:30.460
was not simply flawed, but fundamentally

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.110
incompatible with human freedom.

00:06:34.089 --> 00:06:36.750
Technology, he argued, did not

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:39.630
liberate us; it enslaved us.

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:42.730
The more complex our systems became,

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.409
the more dependent we grew on them,

00:06:45.719 --> 00:06:48.029
and the more powerless the individual

00:06:48.049 --> 00:06:50.239
became in the face of governments,

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:52.799
corporations, and machines.

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:58.510
This wasn’t the disjointed ramblings you

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:01.290
might expect from a mad serial killer.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.190
It was disturbingly rational.

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:06.669
Logical.

00:07:07.409 --> 00:07:08.010
Eloquent.

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:10.380
This was clearly the

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:12.310
work of a brilliant mind.

00:07:12.689 --> 00:07:16.039
Yes, someone prepared to kill, a murderer.

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:19.800
But it was logically set out, touched

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.479
on political theory, sociology,

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:25.429
psychology, and history, and it

00:07:25.429 --> 00:07:28.669
displayed a truly encyclopedic knowledge.

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:32.289
The Unabomber was extraordinary

00:07:32.483 --> 00:07:34.740
in the literal sense of the word.

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:39.360
The manifesto was published, and, true

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.580
to his word, the bombings stopped.

00:07:42.509 --> 00:07:44.860
The FBI and the government had

00:07:44.889 --> 00:07:46.950
honoured their side of the deal,

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:49.479
and the Unabomber honoured his.

00:07:51.006 --> 00:07:53.440
As the authorities hoped, the

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:56.530
phones started ringing off the hook.

00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:58.839
Every lead was followed up

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:01.540
on, but it came to nothing.

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:06.260
However, in the small town of Schenectady,

00:08:06.359 --> 00:08:10.679
New York, one man read the manifesto and

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:14.400
a terrible, sinking feeling came over him.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:18.580
His name was David Kaczynski,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.289
and he had been persuaded to read

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:23.839
the manifesto by his wife, Linda.

00:08:24.789 --> 00:08:27.590
See, David had an older brother,

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:30.836
Theodore, or Ted, for short.

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:34.949
Linda had never met Ted, but

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:36.860
she had heard all about him.

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:40.469
The two brothers had been very close, and

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:43.979
although David hadn’t seen Ted for a long

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:47.050
time, they had kept in touch by letter.

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:51.630
Ted, so David believed, was living as a

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:55.495
recluse in an isolated cabin in the wilds

00:08:55.525 --> 00:08:59.075
of Montana, cut off from the modern world.

00:09:00.575 --> 00:09:03.545
From what Linda had heard about her

00:09:03.555 --> 00:09:06.555
brother-in-law, well, it sounded

00:09:06.735 --> 00:09:08.675
quite similar to what she had read

00:09:08.695 --> 00:09:10.555
in the press about the Unabomber.

00:09:11.325 --> 00:09:13.495
“Just read the manifesto”, she

00:09:13.495 --> 00:09:15.225
told her husband. “For me”.

00:09:16.615 --> 00:09:18.795
Reluctantly, David Kaczynski

00:09:19.105 --> 00:09:20.235
picked up the newspaper.

00:09:21.385 --> 00:09:24.605
Almost immediately, he recognised the

00:09:24.605 --> 00:09:27.575
voice, the intense, almost obsessive

00:09:27.575 --> 00:09:30.425
way of arguing, the deep-seated hatred

00:09:30.465 --> 00:09:33.755
of technology, even certain specific

00:09:33.965 --> 00:09:36.535
and unusual expressions and turns of

00:09:36.535 --> 00:09:39.435
phrase that he knew his brother used.

00:09:40.405 --> 00:09:43.965
His worst fears were confirmed; to

00:09:43.985 --> 00:09:46.745
David Kaczynski, it was undeniable

00:09:47.015 --> 00:09:49.225
that the author of the Unabomber’s

00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:51.655
Manifesto and his older brother,

00:09:51.765 --> 00:09:53.875
Ted, were the same person.

00:09:54.933 --> 00:09:57.323
Instead of immediately going to

00:09:57.323 --> 00:10:01.103
the FBI, he decided to first hire a

00:10:01.173 --> 00:10:03.583
private investigator, then a lawyer.

00:10:04.243 --> 00:10:06.513
He didn’t want to go straight to the

00:10:06.513 --> 00:10:09.243
authorities; he knew his brother might be

00:10:09.243 --> 00:10:12.973
in a fragile mental state, and he didn’t

00:10:12.973 --> 00:10:16.023
want a raid resulting in him getting shot.

00:10:16.813 --> 00:10:19.683
The private investigator compared writing

00:10:19.683 --> 00:10:22.443
samples, samples of Ted’s letters to his

00:10:22.443 --> 00:10:24.883
brother with the Unabomber’s manifesto.

00:10:25.693 --> 00:10:27.313
She determined that it was

00:10:27.323 --> 00:10:29.403
highly likely to be a match.

00:10:30.903 --> 00:10:35.173
Early in 1996, David presented the

00:10:35.173 --> 00:10:38.093
information to the FBI, but demanded

00:10:38.143 --> 00:10:41.153
assurances that it would be an anonymous

00:10:41.183 --> 00:10:44.163
tip-off; the last thing he wanted was

00:10:44.163 --> 00:10:46.303
for his brother to know that it was him.

00:10:47.083 --> 00:10:50.093
See, Ted and David had been very close,

00:10:50.333 --> 00:10:52.713
so close, in fact, that David still

00:10:52.713 --> 00:10:55.203
found it almost impossible to believe

00:10:55.583 --> 00:10:57.543
that the boy that he had grown up

00:10:57.543 --> 00:11:01.013
with—a shy, brilliant child who had

00:11:01.023 --> 00:11:02.853
once spent hours teaching him maths

00:11:02.873 --> 00:11:06.143
puzzles—that this boy could be responsible

00:11:06.383 --> 00:11:08.683
for such cold-blooded violence.

00:11:09.623 --> 00:11:12.353
So to understand why this was so

00:11:12.393 --> 00:11:15.023
painful, and what might have caused

00:11:15.113 --> 00:11:17.623
Ted Kaczynski to behave in this way,

00:11:18.203 --> 00:11:20.683
we need to go back to his early life.

00:11:21.523 --> 00:11:25.273
He was born in Chicago in 1942

00:11:25.763 --> 00:11:27.693
into what seemed, from the

00:11:27.693 --> 00:11:30.583
outside, like a perfectly ordinary,

00:11:30.883 --> 00:11:33.543
hard-working, Polish American family.

00:11:34.653 --> 00:11:37.393
His parents ran a small sausage

00:11:37.393 --> 00:11:39.853
factory; they were not wealthy, but

00:11:40.043 --> 00:11:41.973
they put a high value on education

00:11:42.543 --> 00:11:44.883
and they quickly realised that their

00:11:44.923 --> 00:11:48.263
eldest son was not like other children.

00:11:48.703 --> 00:11:51.663
He was off-the-charts intelligent.

00:11:52.833 --> 00:11:55.853
By the age of six, Ted was doing

00:11:55.853 --> 00:11:58.303
complex arithmetic in his head.

00:11:58.733 --> 00:12:01.003
By eight, he was reading advanced

00:12:01.013 --> 00:12:03.103
scientific material for fun.

00:12:03.633 --> 00:12:06.993
By ten, he had scored so highly on an

00:12:07.053 --> 00:12:10.983
IQ test, getting a mark of 167, that

00:12:10.993 --> 00:12:13.273
psychologists recommended he skip

00:12:13.623 --> 00:12:16.433
not just one year of school, but two.

00:12:17.743 --> 00:12:19.773
This decision would shape

00:12:20.013 --> 00:12:21.053
the rest of his life.

00:12:22.123 --> 00:12:25.323
Skipping grades might have made academic

00:12:25.323 --> 00:12:28.693
sense, but socially it was a disaster.

00:12:29.553 --> 00:12:32.973
Ted was smaller, younger, and

00:12:33.159 --> 00:12:34.933
far more sensitive than the

00:12:34.983 --> 00:12:36.873
older boys in his new class.

00:12:37.463 --> 00:12:40.303
He struggled to fit in, struggled

00:12:40.303 --> 00:12:42.303
to make new friends, and began

00:12:42.303 --> 00:12:45.083
to retreat into the one world in

00:12:45.083 --> 00:12:47.393
which he felt safe: mathematics.

00:12:48.653 --> 00:12:50.763
His teachers described him as

00:12:51.353 --> 00:12:54.693
“quiet”, “withdrawn”, even “timid”.

00:12:55.363 --> 00:12:59.003
But in maths class he came alive.

00:12:59.473 --> 00:13:01.863
Numbers somehow made

00:13:01.863 --> 00:13:04.273
sense when people did not.

00:13:05.223 --> 00:13:07.343
When he was just sixteen years old,

00:13:07.643 --> 00:13:10.923
he was encouraged to apply to, and was

00:13:10.923 --> 00:13:13.763
accepted into Harvard, becoming one of

00:13:13.763 --> 00:13:15.883
the youngest students ever admitted.

00:13:17.043 --> 00:13:20.123
For most families this would

00:13:20.123 --> 00:13:21.573
have been a dream come true.

00:13:22.383 --> 00:13:25.483
But for Ted, who was still very

00:13:25.483 --> 00:13:28.203
much a child on an emotional

00:13:28.213 --> 00:13:30.893
level, Harvard was not a dream.

00:13:31.433 --> 00:13:34.593
It was overwhelming, isolating,

00:13:35.023 --> 00:13:36.673
and sometimes traumatic.

00:13:37.953 --> 00:13:41.743
During his first year, he participated in

00:13:41.743 --> 00:13:45.153
a now-infamous psychological study run by

00:13:45.153 --> 00:13:48.083
a Harvard professor named Henry Murray.

00:13:49.313 --> 00:13:52.923
This study involved long, aggressive

00:13:53.073 --> 00:13:55.443
interrogation sessions designed to

00:13:55.443 --> 00:13:58.083
break down the participants’ beliefs.

00:13:59.573 --> 00:14:01.393
Kaczynski would later describe

00:14:01.393 --> 00:14:04.233
it as deeply humiliating, and

00:14:04.423 --> 00:14:06.323
subsequent commentators have

00:14:06.323 --> 00:14:08.593
suggested that it left lasting

00:14:08.773 --> 00:14:11.343
psychological scars on the young man.

00:14:12.323 --> 00:14:15.193
From Harvard he moved on to graduate

00:14:15.193 --> 00:14:18.283
studies, eventually earning a PhD

00:14:18.283 --> 00:14:20.243
in mathematics at the University of

00:14:20.253 --> 00:14:23.003
Michigan when he was only 25 years old.

00:14:23.833 --> 00:14:26.823
His thesis was so advanced that,

00:14:27.193 --> 00:14:29.443
according to someone on his dissertation

00:14:29.443 --> 00:14:32.853
panel, "maybe 10 or 12 men in the

00:14:32.853 --> 00:14:35.813
country understood or appreciated it."

00:14:36.643 --> 00:14:38.673
It seemed to his professors that he

00:14:38.673 --> 00:14:41.453
was destined to become one of the great

00:14:41.683 --> 00:14:44.163
American mathematicians of his generation.

00:14:45.323 --> 00:14:48.693
And yet, in 1969, something

00:14:49.013 --> 00:14:50.273
extraordinary happened.

00:14:51.543 --> 00:14:54.963
At the age of 27, after accepting

00:14:54.993 --> 00:14:57.383
a prestigious teaching position at

00:14:57.393 --> 00:15:01.903
Berkeley, Ted Kaczynski suddenly resigned.

00:15:02.773 --> 00:15:04.833
He walked away from a seemingly

00:15:04.973 --> 00:15:07.303
secure academic career, from

00:15:07.303 --> 00:15:09.353
a life that most people would

00:15:09.353 --> 00:15:11.413
consider incredibly successful.

00:15:12.443 --> 00:15:16.073
And he simply disappeared, or at least

00:15:16.203 --> 00:15:18.823
withdrew completely from society.

00:15:20.123 --> 00:15:23.543
He moved to a patch of remote land

00:15:23.783 --> 00:15:25.873
outside the tiny town of Lincoln,

00:15:26.133 --> 00:15:28.373
Montana, where he built, with his

00:15:28.443 --> 00:15:31.183
own hands, a tiny wooden cabin.

00:15:31.783 --> 00:15:33.253
No electricity.

00:15:33.263 --> 00:15:34.703
No running water.

00:15:34.923 --> 00:15:35.733
No telephone.

00:15:35.743 --> 00:15:36.333
No car.

00:15:36.723 --> 00:15:37.253
No neighbours.

00:15:38.033 --> 00:15:41.843
Just trees, mountains, and silence.

00:15:43.153 --> 00:15:45.963
It was here, in the solitude of the

00:15:45.963 --> 00:15:48.283
Montana woods, that Ted believed

00:15:48.393 --> 00:15:51.403
he could finally think clearly.

00:15:52.253 --> 00:15:54.753
Here, he would be free from the

00:15:54.763 --> 00:15:57.403
modern world he feared and hated.

00:15:57.853 --> 00:16:00.333
Here, he could live entirely

00:16:00.633 --> 00:16:03.213
independently, growing vegetables,

00:16:03.443 --> 00:16:05.833
trapping animals, reading philosophy,

00:16:06.183 --> 00:16:08.783
and writing page after page of

00:16:08.783 --> 00:16:11.723
notes on the dangers of technology.

00:16:12.933 --> 00:16:16.123
But this isolation did not

00:16:16.273 --> 00:16:18.793
calm him; it radicalised him.

00:16:19.693 --> 00:16:21.423
He watched the forests around him

00:16:21.663 --> 00:16:24.063
being cut down by developers; he

00:16:24.063 --> 00:16:26.393
saw aircraft flying overhead, he

00:16:26.393 --> 00:16:28.913
heard the distant hum of industrial

00:16:28.933 --> 00:16:31.743
progress, and grew convinced that

00:16:31.813 --> 00:16:35.303
technology was spreading like a disease.

00:16:36.363 --> 00:16:38.623
In his journals he wrote that the

00:16:38.633 --> 00:16:41.103
modern world was “robbing people of

00:16:41.103 --> 00:16:43.913
their freedom”, that industrial society

00:16:44.063 --> 00:16:46.303
was “crushing the human spirit”.

00:16:47.883 --> 00:16:51.533
By the mid-1970s, Ted Kaczynski had

00:16:51.543 --> 00:16:54.433
transformed from a gifted mathematician

00:16:54.883 --> 00:16:57.233
into an ideological extremist.

00:16:58.953 --> 00:17:02.313
And in 1978, he made a decision

00:17:02.783 --> 00:17:04.023
that would change everything.

00:17:05.603 --> 00:17:07.093
He built a bomb.

00:17:08.163 --> 00:17:11.353
It was hand-crafted from metal tubing,

00:17:11.693 --> 00:17:15.113
wood, batteries, and homemade components,

00:17:15.433 --> 00:17:18.563
it was placed in a parcel and left in

00:17:18.563 --> 00:17:21.423
a hallway at Northwestern University.

00:17:22.599 --> 00:17:24.689
When it exploded, injuring a

00:17:24.689 --> 00:17:27.559
security officer, his 17-year

00:17:27.609 --> 00:17:29.879
campaign of violence had begun.

00:17:30.663 --> 00:17:34.323
Over the next decade and a half he mailed

00:17:34.443 --> 00:17:37.053
or delivered a series of increasingly

00:17:37.053 --> 00:17:41.213
sophisticated bombs, each designed to maim

00:17:41.463 --> 00:17:44.613
or kill, each carefully constructed to

00:17:44.613 --> 00:17:48.063
leave almost no usable forensic evidence.

00:17:49.533 --> 00:17:52.573
And his methods were meticulous.

00:17:53.173 --> 00:17:55.163
He sanded off fingerprints.

00:17:55.403 --> 00:17:57.423
He used handmade wooden

00:17:57.423 --> 00:17:59.563
parts to avoid traceability.

00:18:00.123 --> 00:18:01.193
He built explosive

00:18:01.193 --> 00:18:03.133
components from scratch.

00:18:03.793 --> 00:18:06.623
He included false clues, misleading

00:18:06.623 --> 00:18:09.303
markings, fake initials, random

00:18:09.313 --> 00:18:12.123
pieces of metal or hair he had

00:18:12.123 --> 00:18:14.413
found in public bathrooms, all

00:18:14.433 --> 00:18:17.453
intended to confuse investigators.

00:18:18.823 --> 00:18:21.623
Some bombs were disguised as parcels,

00:18:21.973 --> 00:18:25.013
others as pieces of scientific equipment.

00:18:26.043 --> 00:18:28.723
One of his early devices was planted

00:18:28.753 --> 00:18:30.509
on an American Airlines flight,

00:18:30.653 --> 00:18:33.223
causing smoke to fill the cabin and

00:18:33.243 --> 00:18:35.543
nearly forcing an emergency landing.

00:18:36.073 --> 00:18:38.183
Another killed a computer

00:18:38.183 --> 00:18:39.933
store owner in Sacramento.

00:18:40.523 --> 00:18:42.433
Another left a university

00:18:42.433 --> 00:18:44.483
professor permanently disabled.

00:18:45.933 --> 00:18:48.983
The authorities at first couldn’t figure

00:18:48.983 --> 00:18:51.583
out the connection between these people.

00:18:52.363 --> 00:18:54.843
Professors, airline executives,

00:18:55.133 --> 00:18:57.103
computer store owners, there

00:18:57.103 --> 00:18:59.283
seemed to be nothing linking them.

00:19:00.273 --> 00:19:02.293
The connection was technology;

00:19:02.923 --> 00:19:05.263
these were people Kaczynski believed

00:19:05.353 --> 00:19:08.153
were responsible for advancing the

00:19:08.203 --> 00:19:11.273
technological society he so despised.

00:19:12.773 --> 00:19:14.803
When it became clear that this was the

00:19:14.803 --> 00:19:17.673
work of a sophisticated terrorist, the

00:19:17.673 --> 00:19:20.773
FBI launched what would become the longest

00:19:20.993 --> 00:19:24.853
and most expensive manhunt in its history.

00:19:25.863 --> 00:19:29.023
And yet, for years, they had nothing.

00:19:29.583 --> 00:19:30.583
No suspect.

00:19:30.863 --> 00:19:31.603
No motive.

00:19:31.813 --> 00:19:35.253
No pattern they could reliably identify.

00:19:36.543 --> 00:19:39.463
To the authorities, the Unabomber was

00:19:39.463 --> 00:19:42.783
not simply dangerous; he was invisible.

00:19:44.003 --> 00:19:45.853
And it probably would have stayed that

00:19:45.853 --> 00:19:49.083
way if not for the publication of the

00:19:49.083 --> 00:19:52.383
manifesto, and the moment David Kaczynski

00:19:52.683 --> 00:19:54.973
recognised the voice of his brother.

00:19:56.493 --> 00:19:59.393
Now, when the FBI received the

00:19:59.393 --> 00:20:02.323
tip, they were initially skeptical.

00:20:03.033 --> 00:20:05.633
They had received thousands of similar

00:20:05.633 --> 00:20:08.613
leads over the years—tips from people

00:20:08.623 --> 00:20:11.793
suspecting neighbours, colleagues, or even

00:20:11.793 --> 00:20:15.663
family members—and all had been dead ends.

00:20:16.843 --> 00:20:18.723
But this one was different.

00:20:19.523 --> 00:20:22.473
The FBI had a number of letters and

00:20:22.483 --> 00:20:24.403
documents written by the Unabomber,

00:20:24.813 --> 00:20:27.663
and when they compared them to the old

00:20:27.663 --> 00:20:30.743
letters and academic papers written by Ted

00:20:30.773 --> 00:20:34.313
Kaczynski, the similarities were striking.

00:20:35.353 --> 00:20:37.813
They used a technique called forensic

00:20:37.853 --> 00:20:39.773
linguistics, which is the study of

00:20:39.773 --> 00:20:43.313
language in a legal context, and the

00:20:43.313 --> 00:20:46.423
experts noted identical usages of

00:20:46.423 --> 00:20:49.953
certain uncommon words and specific,

00:20:50.413 --> 00:20:53.223
idiosyncratic grammatical constructions.

00:20:54.373 --> 00:20:57.203
With mounting evidence, the FBI

00:20:57.463 --> 00:20:59.453
obtained a search warrant for

00:20:59.453 --> 00:21:01.843
Ted Kaczynski's cabin in Montana.

00:21:02.783 --> 00:21:04.833
They knew that they had to catch him

00:21:05.113 --> 00:21:08.563
red-handed; other than the similarities

00:21:08.643 --> 00:21:11.003
in writing styles, they had nothing

00:21:11.033 --> 00:21:13.493
concrete linking him to the crimes.

00:21:14.053 --> 00:21:16.443
The cabin was their last hope.

00:21:17.693 --> 00:21:22.143
On April 3, 1996, a team of FBI

00:21:22.183 --> 00:21:24.133
agents arrived on the scene.

00:21:25.303 --> 00:21:27.633
Posing as forestry workers,

00:21:27.903 --> 00:21:29.423
they knocked on the door.

00:21:30.333 --> 00:21:32.393
A dishevelled but importantly

00:21:32.703 --> 00:21:35.163
unarmed Kaczynski opened,

00:21:35.643 --> 00:21:37.153
and was swiftly arrested.

00:21:38.373 --> 00:21:41.123
And a search of the cabin revealed

00:21:41.253 --> 00:21:43.493
everything the FBI was looking for.

00:21:44.233 --> 00:21:46.953
They found a wealth of evidence, including

00:21:46.953 --> 00:21:49.913
four fully constructed and ready-to-mail

00:21:49.923 --> 00:21:53.023
bombs, and the original, handwritten

00:21:53.033 --> 00:21:56.923
draft of the 35,000-word manifesto.

00:21:57.963 --> 00:22:00.253
Alongside this, there were detailed

00:22:00.293 --> 00:22:02.943
journals containing the formula and

00:22:02.983 --> 00:22:06.393
process for every single one of the 16

00:22:06.393 --> 00:22:08.743
bombings the Unabomber had carried out.

00:22:09.923 --> 00:22:11.183
These weren’t written in

00:22:11.413 --> 00:22:12.363
plain English, though.

00:22:12.983 --> 00:22:16.173
Kaczynski had encrypted them using an

00:22:16.173 --> 00:22:18.833
incredibly sophisticated system of codes,

00:22:19.203 --> 00:22:21.593
but fortunately for the authorities,

00:22:21.983 --> 00:22:25.283
the ciphers, the codes to decipher the

00:22:25.283 --> 00:22:27.913
system, were also found in the cabin.

00:22:28.833 --> 00:22:30.543
Ted Kaczynski was arrested.

00:22:31.003 --> 00:22:32.953
The man who had been the subject

00:22:33.103 --> 00:22:35.693
of the most complex, long-running,

00:22:35.853 --> 00:22:37.953
and expensive investigation in US

00:22:37.953 --> 00:22:40.533
history was finally in custody.

00:22:41.483 --> 00:22:44.093
But the story doesn't end there.

00:22:44.803 --> 00:22:47.903
The trial, and the ultimate fate of

00:22:47.903 --> 00:22:50.743
this boy-genius-turned-terrorist,

00:22:51.113 --> 00:22:53.743
would raise profound questions about

00:22:53.903 --> 00:22:56.793
responsibility, mental health, and

00:22:57.183 --> 00:22:59.443
the very nature of modern society.

00:23:00.243 --> 00:23:02.503
Ted Kaczynski never denied

00:23:02.763 --> 00:23:04.953
being The Unabomber, but his

00:23:04.963 --> 00:23:07.243
legal defense was complicated.

00:23:08.483 --> 00:23:11.233
His lawyers wanted to argue that

00:23:11.233 --> 00:23:13.563
he was mentally ill and therefore

00:23:13.763 --> 00:23:16.263
not responsible for his actions.

00:23:16.653 --> 00:23:19.153
They wanted him to plead "not

00:23:19.163 --> 00:23:21.873
guilty by reason of insanity."

00:23:22.523 --> 00:23:24.593
In other words, he was crazy.

00:23:25.823 --> 00:23:28.363
Kaczynski, however, fiercely

00:23:28.403 --> 00:23:30.533
objected to this strategy.

00:23:31.353 --> 00:23:34.033
He saw himself not as a madman,

00:23:34.333 --> 00:23:37.453
but as a rational revolutionary.

00:23:38.273 --> 00:23:41.703
To be declared insane would invalidate

00:23:41.883 --> 00:23:44.933
his manifesto and his entire political

00:23:44.933 --> 00:23:48.403
philosophy, and the entire reason he

00:23:48.403 --> 00:23:50.243
had embarked on his bombing campaign

00:23:50.503 --> 00:23:53.273
was for his views to be taken seriously.

00:23:54.253 --> 00:23:56.813
He was so determined that he eventually

00:23:56.943 --> 00:23:58.863
tried to fire his own defense team

00:23:59.113 --> 00:24:01.003
and represent himself in court.

00:24:02.263 --> 00:24:04.933
In the end, he avoided a potentially

00:24:05.153 --> 00:24:07.163
lengthy and highly publicised

00:24:07.193 --> 00:24:09.753
trial by accepting a plea bargain.

00:24:10.963 --> 00:24:15.245
On January 22, 1998, Ted Kaczynski

00:24:15.555 --> 00:24:17.875
pleaded guilty to all charges.

00:24:18.615 --> 00:24:20.335
In exchange for avoiding the

00:24:20.335 --> 00:24:22.805
death penalty, he was sentenced to

00:24:22.905 --> 00:24:25.295
eight consecutive life sentences

00:24:25.485 --> 00:24:27.815
without the possibility of parole.

00:24:29.175 --> 00:24:31.375
He was transferred to the Supermax

00:24:31.415 --> 00:24:34.135
prison in Florence, Colorado, where he

00:24:34.145 --> 00:24:36.215
lived out the remainder of his days,

00:24:36.445 --> 00:24:38.545
much of it in solitary confinement,

00:24:39.015 --> 00:24:41.475
before finally killing himself in

00:24:41.475 --> 00:24:44.805
June of 2023, at the age of 81.

00:24:45.665 --> 00:24:49.055
And there is another twist to this story.

00:24:49.875 --> 00:24:53.165
His bombing spree started in 1978,

00:24:53.645 --> 00:24:56.435
in a world we might today consider

00:24:56.515 --> 00:24:59.175
relatively free from technology.

00:25:00.255 --> 00:25:03.055
Today, where technology is infinitely

00:25:03.055 --> 00:25:05.125
more entrenched in every aspect of

00:25:05.125 --> 00:25:07.465
our lives than 50 years ago, his

00:25:07.495 --> 00:25:09.815
anti-technology message is able to

00:25:09.815 --> 00:25:12.995
spread ever further and faster, and is

00:25:12.995 --> 00:25:15.655
reaching more people than ever before.

00:25:16.685 --> 00:25:19.465
Whether it’s simply that his manifesto is

00:25:19.505 --> 00:25:22.575
easily accessible online, or that people

00:25:22.575 --> 00:25:25.285
are making TikToks about “Uncle Ted was

00:25:25.285 --> 00:25:28.025
right”, his worldview and philosophy is

00:25:28.025 --> 00:25:30.795
becoming more and more well-known through

00:25:30.795 --> 00:25:33.895
the very technology he sought to destroy.

00:25:35.695 --> 00:25:37.615
OK, then, that is it for today's

00:25:37.645 --> 00:25:39.205
episode on The Unabomber.

00:25:39.435 --> 00:25:40.805

00:25:41.055 --> 00:25:42.705
