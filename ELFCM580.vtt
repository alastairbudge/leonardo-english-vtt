Hello, hello, hello, and welcome

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.900
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.719
Minds, by Leonardo English, the show

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:14.400
where you can listen to fascinating

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.850
stories and learn weird and wonderful

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.900
things about the world at the same

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.580
time as improving your English.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.820
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.760
to be talking about Operation Valkyrie

00:00:27.003 --> 00:00:29.169
and the plot to assassinate Hitler.

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.150
It’s a story of bombs, plots, secret

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.800
briefcases, underground bunkers, and

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:38.230
one of history’s greatest “what ifs”.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.669
OK then, let's not waste a

00:00:40.669 --> 00:00:42.890
minute and get right into it.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.720
In the early afternoon of July

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:52.070
20th, 1944, twenty or so senior Nazi

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.420
officials were gathered around a

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:57.589
long oak table in the Wolf’s Lair,

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.509
Hitler’s military headquarters on the

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.700
Eastern Front, in modern-day Poland.

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.519
The situation for the Nazi war

00:01:07.529 --> 00:01:10.560
machine was getting worse by the day.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.230
The Allies had landed in Normandy six

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.010
weeks earlier, Russia was advancing

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.470
on the Eastern Front, the Allies

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.420
had captured Rome, and the United

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.090
States was advancing towards Japan.

00:01:25.779 --> 00:01:28.719
If the war was still winnable

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.219
for Nazi Germany, well, it would

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.789
take something very special.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.740
A meeting had been called, and

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.029
senior Nazi leaders had been

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:40.210
instructed to fly in for it.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.335
One such officer was Claus von

00:01:43.335 --> 00:01:46.139
Stauffenberg, a 36-year-old

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.229
Lieutenant Colonel who had been

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.390
awarded the Iron Cross for his

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.529
bravery in the Battle of France.

00:01:53.839 --> 00:01:56.420
Von Stauffenberg knew all too

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.080
well the cost of war; he had been

00:01:59.089 --> 00:02:01.220
fighting in North Africa, where he

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.619
had lost an eye, his entire right

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.909
hand, and two fingers on his left.

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:10.560
It had taken him three months to recover,

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.680
but he was still without one eye and

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.550
seven fingers, so he was transferred to

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.350
office duty, far from the front line.

00:02:20.556 --> 00:02:23.356
He had met Hitler on several occasions,

00:02:23.486 --> 00:02:25.756
and Hitler had always been polite

00:02:25.756 --> 00:02:28.466
and courteous to him; after all,

00:02:28.706 --> 00:02:31.156
the sacrifices this man had made for

00:02:31.156 --> 00:02:33.416
the Nazi cause were plain to see.

00:02:34.386 --> 00:02:37.356
So when von Stauffenberg arrived a

00:02:37.356 --> 00:02:39.426
couple of minutes late for the meeting,

00:02:39.976 --> 00:02:42.756
instead of receiving a dressing down

00:02:43.126 --> 00:02:45.196
and being shouted at by the Führer,

00:02:45.696 --> 00:02:47.856
there was a quiet nod of acceptance.

00:02:48.906 --> 00:02:51.676
Indeed, von Stauffenberg had only

00:02:51.686 --> 00:02:54.176
arrived at the Wolf’s Lair that morning.

00:02:55.186 --> 00:02:57.356
He would have been on time for

00:02:57.356 --> 00:02:59.896
the meeting, but it was such a hot

00:02:59.906 --> 00:03:02.426
day and he was drenched in sweat.

00:03:03.106 --> 00:03:05.446
He had to go and change his shirt, and

00:03:05.606 --> 00:03:08.016
he needed his assistant to help him.

00:03:08.726 --> 00:03:12.016
After all, belts, buckles, and buttons,

00:03:12.326 --> 00:03:13.936
they aren’t so simple if you are

00:03:13.966 --> 00:03:16.186
only operating with three fingers.

00:03:17.766 --> 00:03:20.566
The meeting was to be held in a different

00:03:20.596 --> 00:03:23.906
room from usual; normally, these types

00:03:23.906 --> 00:03:26.186
of meetings were held deep underground,

00:03:26.306 --> 00:03:28.556
in reinforced concrete bunkers.

00:03:29.056 --> 00:03:32.196
But it was so hot that nobody

00:03:32.196 --> 00:03:33.686
would have lasted very long down

00:03:33.686 --> 00:03:35.436
there, without any ventilation.

00:03:36.096 --> 00:03:38.156
So the meeting was taking

00:03:38.156 --> 00:03:40.506
place above ground, with the

00:03:40.506 --> 00:03:42.618
windows open for fresh air.

00:03:43.884 --> 00:03:46.626
Von Stauffenberg had been ushered into

00:03:46.626 --> 00:03:49.246
an room next to the conference room to

00:03:49.246 --> 00:03:50.936
allow him to get changed in private.

00:03:52.176 --> 00:03:54.946
Together with his assistant, the pair

00:03:55.036 --> 00:03:57.116
proceeded to open up the briefcase.

00:03:58.326 --> 00:04:01.266
They took out the spare shirt, but

00:04:01.516 --> 00:04:03.316
they were more interested in what the

00:04:03.316 --> 00:04:06.686
shirt was wrapped around: two sticks

00:04:06.866 --> 00:04:09.516
of plastic explosives, two bombs.

00:04:10.626 --> 00:04:13.526
The men began to prime the device,

00:04:13.876 --> 00:04:16.476
setting a timer for 10 minutes.

00:04:17.956 --> 00:04:21.146
They completed the first, but before

00:04:21.146 --> 00:04:23.256
the men had the chance to prime the

00:04:23.256 --> 00:04:25.756
second bomb, there was a knock on the

00:04:25.756 --> 00:04:27.726
door: “What are you up to in there?

00:04:27.826 --> 00:04:30.446
Quick, the meeting is about to begin.”

00:04:31.246 --> 00:04:33.406
There were assurances that they’d be out

00:04:33.426 --> 00:04:35.546
in a minute; von Stauffenberg was just

00:04:35.556 --> 00:04:37.196
having a bit of trouble with his belt.

00:04:38.156 --> 00:04:39.696
And sure enough, shortly

00:04:39.706 --> 00:04:41.396
after, the door opened.

00:04:41.866 --> 00:04:43.866
Von Stauffenberg was there in

00:04:43.866 --> 00:04:46.176
a new shirt, briefcase in hand.

00:04:47.066 --> 00:04:48.916
He was ushered into the

00:04:48.946 --> 00:04:50.336
conference room, where the

00:04:50.336 --> 00:04:52.806
meeting was already in full flow.

00:04:53.646 --> 00:04:55.486
Hitler was standing in the middle,

00:04:55.776 --> 00:04:58.396
leaning over a map placed on the table.

00:04:59.436 --> 00:05:01.836
Von Stauffenberg approached the table

00:05:02.056 --> 00:05:04.686
and slid the briefcase underneath,

00:05:05.086 --> 00:05:06.956
next to where Hitler was standing.

00:05:07.996 --> 00:05:09.656
A couple of minutes later, an

00:05:09.656 --> 00:05:11.986
attendant came in and knocked von

00:05:12.016 --> 00:05:14.376
Stauffenberg on the shoulder: Sir,

00:05:14.816 --> 00:05:16.306
there’s a telephone call for you.

00:05:17.366 --> 00:05:18.956
Von Stauffenberg made his

00:05:18.956 --> 00:05:20.706
excuses and left the room.

00:05:21.756 --> 00:05:25.736
At 12.42, just a few minutes after

00:05:25.736 --> 00:05:27.376
von Stauffenberg’s departure,

00:05:27.616 --> 00:05:30.426
there was a massive explosion right

00:05:30.626 --> 00:05:32.646
in the heart of the Wolf’s Lair.

00:05:33.246 --> 00:05:35.316
It looked like it might even have

00:05:35.326 --> 00:05:37.906
come from the conference room itself.

00:05:39.446 --> 00:05:41.956
By this point, von Stauffenberg was making

00:05:41.966 --> 00:05:45.096
a beeline for the perimeter, heading

00:05:45.116 --> 00:05:47.926
for the exit as quickly as possible.

00:05:49.026 --> 00:05:50.956
It’s not known exactly what he told

00:05:50.956 --> 00:05:52.846
the guards to be allowed through the

00:05:52.856 --> 00:05:55.146
numerous checkpoints that surrounded

00:05:55.146 --> 00:05:58.696
the Wolf’s Lair, but by 1 pm, less

00:05:58.886 --> 00:06:01.416
than 20 minutes after the blast,

00:06:01.776 --> 00:06:03.666
von Stauffenberg and his assistant

00:06:03.876 --> 00:06:06.336
were on an aeroplane back to Berlin.

00:06:07.106 --> 00:06:08.866
The hard part was done.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.496
Adolf Hitler was dead, and a bunch

00:06:12.526 --> 00:06:14.296
of his senior leadership too.

00:06:15.336 --> 00:06:18.256
The next part was, comparatively,

00:06:18.306 --> 00:06:20.986
easy: mobilise the emergency

00:06:21.186 --> 00:06:22.786
“continuity of government” plan,

00:06:23.096 --> 00:06:26.326
appoint an interim successor, and most

00:06:26.346 --> 00:06:29.086
probably seek peace with the Allies.

00:06:30.566 --> 00:06:34.346
The only problem was…Hitler wasn’t dead.

00:06:35.596 --> 00:06:38.446
Unbeknownst to von Stauffenberg, his

00:06:38.446 --> 00:06:40.846
carefully positioned briefcase had been

00:06:40.846 --> 00:06:45.046
slightly pushed to one side, tucked behind

00:06:45.326 --> 00:06:48.196
the leg of the heavy oak conference table.

00:06:49.426 --> 00:06:52.096
Most probably, this was done by an

00:06:52.116 --> 00:06:54.606
officer called Heinz Brandt, who

00:06:54.836 --> 00:06:56.446
just pushed the briefcase with his

00:06:56.446 --> 00:06:59.506
feet, not out of any great patriotic

00:06:59.596 --> 00:07:02.656
duty, but because it was in the way

00:07:02.756 --> 00:07:04.906
of where he wanted to put his legs.

00:07:05.906 --> 00:07:08.266
It might well have been the act that

00:07:08.266 --> 00:07:11.346
saved Hitler’s life, but it cost

00:07:11.376 --> 00:07:13.626
Brandt his: he died the following

00:07:13.626 --> 00:07:16.546
day, one of the four people in the

00:07:16.566 --> 00:07:18.726
conference room to die from the blast.

00:07:19.446 --> 00:07:21.266
Another nine were seriously

00:07:21.276 --> 00:07:24.046
injured, and the remaining eleven

00:07:24.276 --> 00:07:26.366
escaped with minor injuries.

00:07:27.096 --> 00:07:30.206
And this included the target of

00:07:30.206 --> 00:07:32.406
the entire operation: Adolf Hitler.

00:07:33.556 --> 00:07:36.716
His trousers were torn to shreds, his

00:07:36.716 --> 00:07:39.896
arm was damaged, and his eardrum burst.

00:07:40.346 --> 00:07:42.086
But he survived.

00:07:43.276 --> 00:07:45.376
In the immediate aftermath of the

00:07:45.376 --> 00:07:47.826
event, he could be seen wandering

00:07:47.836 --> 00:07:50.396
around the rubble, inspecting the chaos.

00:07:51.576 --> 00:07:53.496
Officers tried to understand

00:07:53.986 --> 00:07:54.766
what had happened.

00:07:55.346 --> 00:07:57.836
Had a Soviet bomber flown overhead

00:07:57.876 --> 00:08:00.186
and dropped a bomb with such precision

00:08:00.486 --> 00:08:02.506
that it landed in the exact conference

00:08:02.506 --> 00:08:04.366
room where the Führer had been meeting?

00:08:05.426 --> 00:08:08.176
No, no planes had been seen, and

00:08:08.386 --> 00:08:10.136
there were no other explosions.

00:08:11.436 --> 00:08:14.566
The focus quickly switched to a threat

00:08:14.746 --> 00:08:18.126
from within, and suspicion fell on the

00:08:18.136 --> 00:08:20.576
man who had entered with a briefcase,

00:08:20.916 --> 00:08:22.866
then quickly left without one:

00:08:23.456 --> 00:08:26.451
Lieutenant Colonel von Stauffenberg.

00:08:27.196 --> 00:08:29.896
By this point, von Stauffenberg was

00:08:29.896 --> 00:08:32.016
in the air, on the way back to Berlin.

00:08:33.096 --> 00:08:35.486
By the time he landed, he expected

00:08:35.746 --> 00:08:38.936
Operation Valkyrie to be well underway.

00:08:39.816 --> 00:08:43.451
Now, Operation Valkyrie was the codename

00:08:43.566 --> 00:08:45.696
for the operation that would be triggered

00:08:45.986 --> 00:08:48.496
if there was a full breakdown of civic

00:08:48.526 --> 00:08:51.916
order in Nazi Germany, or if there

00:08:51.916 --> 00:08:54.196
was some kind of uprising from the

00:08:54.206 --> 00:08:56.506
foreign workers in German factories.

00:08:57.696 --> 00:09:00.226
It was essentially a plan that would see

00:09:00.226 --> 00:09:04.006
the territorial reserve army seize control

00:09:04.006 --> 00:09:06.716
of the streets and key state functions.

00:09:07.576 --> 00:09:09.376
Importantly, Operation

00:09:09.386 --> 00:09:12.496
Valkyrie wasn’t a secret plot.

00:09:12.916 --> 00:09:14.526
It had been drawn up as a

00:09:14.576 --> 00:09:17.476
genuine emergency plan to crush

00:09:17.686 --> 00:09:20.176
unrest or uprisings, and Hitler

00:09:20.186 --> 00:09:22.616
himself even signed off on it.

00:09:23.266 --> 00:09:26.586
But unbeknownst to Hitler, Operation

00:09:26.596 --> 00:09:29.836
Valkyrie was being used to take him down.

00:09:30.626 --> 00:09:32.736
It was a clever idea in theory.

00:09:33.356 --> 00:09:35.846
Kill Hitler, declare that he had been

00:09:35.866 --> 00:09:38.906
assassinated by rogue, rebel forces

00:09:39.116 --> 00:09:41.761
within the Nazi party, namely the SS.

00:09:42.646 --> 00:09:45.096
Arrest these supposedly rogue forces,

00:09:45.356 --> 00:09:47.856
declare martial law, and declare

00:09:47.856 --> 00:09:50.015
a Field Marshall called Erwin von

00:09:50.015 --> 00:09:52.136
Witzleben as Commander in Chief.

00:09:53.336 --> 00:09:55.596
It was a clever idea because it would

00:09:55.596 --> 00:09:59.316
pin all blame on the SS and “treacherous

00:09:59.316 --> 00:10:01.806
forces within the Nazi party”, allowing

00:10:01.996 --> 00:10:05.176
for a relatively smooth transition to

00:10:05.176 --> 00:10:07.836
a Hitler-free Germany without all of

00:10:07.836 --> 00:10:10.336
the mess that might come from a more

00:10:10.426 --> 00:10:12.906
overt coup or assassination attempt.

00:10:13.846 --> 00:10:16.846
And, after all, this was far from

00:10:16.846 --> 00:10:19.086
the only attempt on Hitler’s life.

00:10:19.596 --> 00:10:22.836
There are 42 documented assassination

00:10:22.836 --> 00:10:25.556
attempts, with presumably many more

00:10:25.556 --> 00:10:27.386
than this that were never discovered.

00:10:27.896 --> 00:10:30.916
From poisoned letters to bombs to

00:10:30.926 --> 00:10:34.966
snipers, starting in 1932, all manner

00:10:35.006 --> 00:10:37.646
of methods and locations were tried.

00:10:38.406 --> 00:10:41.526
Miraculously, Hitler survived all of them.

00:10:42.256 --> 00:10:45.549
But it was this attempt, the attempt

00:10:45.873 --> 00:10:48.996
of the 20th of July, 1944, which was

00:10:48.996 --> 00:10:51.856
the widest reaching, the best planned,

00:10:52.206 --> 00:10:55.316
and perhaps came closest to succeeding.

00:10:56.436 --> 00:11:00.206
Now, it’s unclear exactly how

00:11:00.206 --> 00:11:01.796
many people were involved in the

00:11:01.796 --> 00:11:04.506
plot, and what knowledge different

00:11:04.506 --> 00:11:06.746
people had of its inner workings.

00:11:07.689 --> 00:11:09.786
What is clear is that there had

00:11:09.786 --> 00:11:12.106
been various groups within the

00:11:12.106 --> 00:11:14.516
Nazi upper leadership that had been

00:11:14.546 --> 00:11:17.026
planning to overthrow or kill Hitler

00:11:17.336 --> 00:11:19.136
since before the start of the war.

00:11:20.536 --> 00:11:22.779
And as for their intentions,

00:11:23.316 --> 00:11:24.966
well, they were varied.

00:11:25.846 --> 00:11:28.346
Those directly involved in the July

00:11:28.356 --> 00:11:31.126
20th plot included nationalists,

00:11:31.396 --> 00:11:34.006
democrats, aristocrats and communists.

00:11:34.396 --> 00:11:37.676
This wasn’t one homogenous group with

00:11:37.676 --> 00:11:40.966
a clear, unified aim for post-Hitler

00:11:41.016 --> 00:11:43.636
Germany, nor is it fair to characterise

00:11:43.666 --> 00:11:46.116
them as some great upstanding group

00:11:46.116 --> 00:11:48.806
of moral citizens who were disgusted

00:11:48.886 --> 00:11:50.416
by the behaviour of the Nazis.

00:11:51.116 --> 00:11:53.116
For some, this might

00:11:53.116 --> 00:11:54.376
well have been the case.

00:11:54.716 --> 00:11:57.396
In von Stauffenberg’s case, several

00:11:57.396 --> 00:11:59.526
historians have suggested that

00:11:59.526 --> 00:12:01.626
he had a strong moral objection

00:12:01.896 --> 00:12:03.296
to the treatment of Jews.

00:12:04.096 --> 00:12:06.176
For many other military officers, though,

00:12:06.666 --> 00:12:09.466
the motivation was more pragmatic.

00:12:09.916 --> 00:12:13.146
The disasters at Stalingrad in 1943,

00:12:13.186 --> 00:12:16.126
the Allied landings in Normandy in June

00:12:16.246 --> 00:12:19.966
1944, and the rapid Soviet advance on

00:12:19.966 --> 00:12:22.346
the Eastern Front convinced them the

00:12:22.356 --> 00:12:25.146
war was lost under Hitler’s leadership.

00:12:26.306 --> 00:12:29.386
It was a motley crew, but what did

00:12:29.396 --> 00:12:31.846
unite them was a firm belief that

00:12:31.906 --> 00:12:34.266
Adolf Hitler needed to be removed

00:12:34.276 --> 00:12:37.386
from power, and killing him and

00:12:37.416 --> 00:12:39.956
pinning the blame on “rebel factions”

00:12:40.126 --> 00:12:41.686
was the best way of doing it.

00:12:42.536 --> 00:12:45.296
So, when von Stauffenberg touched

00:12:45.306 --> 00:12:48.366
down in Berlin and made his way to the

00:12:48.396 --> 00:12:50.736
army headquarters, he was expecting

00:12:50.736 --> 00:12:53.246
to hear that Operation Valkyrie was

00:12:53.266 --> 00:12:55.926
in full swing: Hitler was dead, the

00:12:55.926 --> 00:12:58.346
reserve army units had taken control

00:12:58.506 --> 00:13:00.766
of the key state institutions, and

00:13:00.766 --> 00:13:03.216
the groups most loyal to Hitler, in

00:13:03.216 --> 00:13:06.446
particular the SS, had been neutralised.

00:13:07.436 --> 00:13:10.576
But he soon realised that things

00:13:10.646 --> 00:13:12.946
weren’t going as smoothly as he had

00:13:12.946 --> 00:13:15.876
hoped and that, in fact, there was

00:13:15.876 --> 00:13:18.806
a potentially devastating problem.

00:13:20.036 --> 00:13:22.056
There had been a phone call from the

00:13:22.066 --> 00:13:24.556
Wolf’s Lair to the plotters at central

00:13:24.556 --> 00:13:27.516
command confirming that there had been

00:13:27.516 --> 00:13:29.926
a massive explosion in the conference

00:13:29.926 --> 00:13:32.556
room, but the message that came

00:13:32.556 --> 00:13:35.436
through was that Hitler had survived.

00:13:36.836 --> 00:13:39.936
And if Hitler wasn’t dead, then

00:13:39.936 --> 00:13:41.936
the whole thing came crashing down.

00:13:42.756 --> 00:13:45.296
For Operation Valkyrie to work, the

00:13:45.296 --> 00:13:48.986
reserve army units had to buy the lie

00:13:49.236 --> 00:13:52.066
that Hitler had been killed by disloyal

00:13:52.066 --> 00:13:55.666
forces within the Nazi party, and that was

00:13:55.666 --> 00:13:57.856
the reason the crackdown was necessary.

00:13:59.006 --> 00:14:01.686
At first, von Stauffenberg insisted,

00:14:02.126 --> 00:14:04.476
“I saw the explosion. Nobody could

00:14:04.476 --> 00:14:06.546
have survived it. Hitler is dead.”

00:14:07.966 --> 00:14:11.276
So the plotters had these two

00:14:11.326 --> 00:14:13.460
contradicting reports: von

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:15.806
Stauffenberg saying Hitler is dead,

00:14:16.176 --> 00:14:18.276
and the other saying he isn’t.

00:14:19.386 --> 00:14:22.646
Finally, at 4 pm that afternoon,

00:14:22.876 --> 00:14:24.806
the order was given to put

00:14:24.996 --> 00:14:26.926
Operation Valkyrie into action.

00:14:27.576 --> 00:14:30.546
Radio messages were sent to major military

00:14:30.546 --> 00:14:33.346
centres, and across Berlin, and in

00:14:33.376 --> 00:14:35.316
military districts throughout Germany,

00:14:35.779 --> 00:14:38.296
reserve army units were mobilised.

00:14:39.026 --> 00:14:41.406
They began arresting local SS

00:14:41.416 --> 00:14:43.536
officers, seizing key government

00:14:43.546 --> 00:14:45.346
buildings, and preparing

00:14:45.366 --> 00:14:47.426
proclamations to the German people.

00:14:48.456 --> 00:14:50.876
For a few tense hours that

00:14:50.906 --> 00:14:53.336
afternoon, it looked as though

00:14:53.336 --> 00:14:55.586
the coup might actually succeed.

00:14:56.346 --> 00:14:59.186
And let’s remember, these reserve

00:14:59.206 --> 00:15:01.646
troops don’t know that they are part

00:15:01.666 --> 00:15:04.036
of a coup; they are simply following

00:15:04.046 --> 00:15:06.256
their orders, which are to put into

00:15:06.256 --> 00:15:08.486
place this contingency plan, which

00:15:08.636 --> 00:15:10.686
involves rooting out treacherous

00:15:10.716 --> 00:15:12.546
elements within the Nazi party.

00:15:13.156 --> 00:15:15.853
They even manage to detain Joseph

00:15:15.853 --> 00:15:18.086
Goebbels, the Nazi propaganda

00:15:18.086 --> 00:15:19.896
chief, in his Berlin office.

00:15:20.686 --> 00:15:23.146
Goebbels has realised it’s a coup,

00:15:23.516 --> 00:15:26.056
and knows the one thing he can do

00:15:26.086 --> 00:15:29.006
to stop it: make sure the reservists

00:15:29.006 --> 00:15:31.206
know that Hitler isn’t dead.

00:15:32.116 --> 00:15:35.676
So when he is detained by Major Otto Ernst

00:15:35.696 --> 00:15:38.596
Remer, a commanding officer of the reserve

00:15:38.626 --> 00:15:42.126
troops, Goebbels puts Hitler on the line.

00:15:43.216 --> 00:15:46.386
Major Remer now realises that he has been

00:15:46.436 --> 00:15:49.746
duped, and he listens for his orders.

00:15:50.496 --> 00:15:52.266
Crush the plot, he is

00:15:52.266 --> 00:15:54.966
told, and take them alive.

00:15:56.356 --> 00:15:58.076
It’s around 7 o’clock in the

00:15:58.126 --> 00:16:00.056
evening at this point, and the

00:16:00.056 --> 00:16:02.746
conspirators are in disarray.

00:16:04.206 --> 00:16:06.926
General Friedrich Fromm, the commander

00:16:06.926 --> 00:16:09.406
in chief of the reserve army, had been

00:16:09.436 --> 00:16:12.466
aware of the plot and had done nothing

00:16:12.466 --> 00:16:15.026
to stop it, essentially making him

00:16:15.026 --> 00:16:17.696
a conspirator and aide to the coup.

00:16:18.636 --> 00:16:22.036
But when it became clear that the bomb

00:16:22.256 --> 00:16:25.226
hadn’t done its job, he quickly started

00:16:25.226 --> 00:16:27.756
to cover his tracks, switching sides.

00:16:28.396 --> 00:16:30.816
He even tries to have von

00:16:30.816 --> 00:16:31.426
Stauffenberg arrested.

00:16:31.986 --> 00:16:33.116
Chaos breaks out.

00:16:33.566 --> 00:16:36.221
There was a firefight at the Bendlerblock,

00:16:36.226 --> 00:16:38.576
the Berlin headquarters where several

00:16:38.606 --> 00:16:40.676
of the conspirators were based, and

00:16:40.896 --> 00:16:43.416
von Stauffenberg was shot in the arm.

00:16:44.337 --> 00:16:46.827
By 11 pm that evening, the

00:16:46.837 --> 00:16:49.757
tide had well and truly turned.

00:16:50.397 --> 00:16:52.277
The Bendlerblock was surrounded,

00:16:52.587 --> 00:16:54.787
and the reserve army managed

00:16:54.807 --> 00:16:56.603
to overpower the plotters.

00:16:57.567 --> 00:16:59.567
General Fromm pushed for an

00:16:59.637 --> 00:17:01.957
impromptu court to be set up to

00:17:02.027 --> 00:17:05.027
try the conspirators, and he then

00:17:05.077 --> 00:17:07.097
court-martialled four of the conspirators,

00:17:07.107 --> 00:17:09.217
including von Stauffenberg, who were

00:17:09.247 --> 00:17:11.547
taken into the courtyard and shot.

00:17:12.447 --> 00:17:14.527
Presumably, Fromm rushed this

00:17:14.527 --> 00:17:16.867
through, despite Hitler’s express

00:17:16.907 --> 00:17:19.327
order for the conspirators not to

00:17:19.327 --> 00:17:21.637
be executed, so that they couldn’t

00:17:21.647 --> 00:17:23.977
reveal his involvement in the plot.

00:17:24.697 --> 00:17:27.077
Or, as Goebbels neatly put it,

00:17:27.467 --> 00:17:30.007
“You have been in a damn hurry to

00:17:30.007 --> 00:17:31.817
get your witnesses below ground."

00:17:33.547 --> 00:17:36.307
The entire coup, or attempted

00:17:36.307 --> 00:17:39.207
coup, lasted less than 12 hours.

00:17:40.167 --> 00:17:42.707
And the aftermath was brutal.

00:17:43.617 --> 00:17:45.447
Over the following weeks, the

00:17:45.447 --> 00:17:47.467
Gestapo uncovered thousands of

00:17:47.477 --> 00:17:50.027
people connected, or suspected of

00:17:50.037 --> 00:17:51.907
being connected, to the conspiracy.

00:17:52.647 --> 00:17:55.047
Show trials were held in the People’s

00:17:55.047 --> 00:17:57.917
Court, presided over by the raging,

00:17:58.197 --> 00:18:00.507
screaming judge Roland Freisler.

00:18:01.727 --> 00:18:04.387
Many were humiliated before being

00:18:04.387 --> 00:18:06.347
sentenced to death by hanging,

00:18:06.717 --> 00:18:09.597
strangled slowly with piano wire.

00:18:10.337 --> 00:18:13.307
In total, some 7,000 people were

00:18:13.337 --> 00:18:16.427
arrested and almost 5,000 were executed,

00:18:16.857 --> 00:18:19.327
including the side-switching General

00:18:19.337 --> 00:18:21.647
Fromm, who was kept in prison for

00:18:21.647 --> 00:18:24.277
a year, only to be executed shortly

00:18:24.277 --> 00:18:27.077
before Germany’s surrender in 1945.

00:18:28.257 --> 00:18:31.377
And to this day, the plot has remained

00:18:31.487 --> 00:18:33.737
one of history’s great “what ifs”.

00:18:34.667 --> 00:18:37.547
After all, it's almost more surprising

00:18:37.757 --> 00:18:39.777
that the blast didn’t kill Hitler.

00:18:40.737 --> 00:18:43.237
If von Stauffenberg had been able to

00:18:43.237 --> 00:18:45.647
prime both bombs instead of only one,

00:18:45.647 --> 00:19:48.937
it would almost certainly have killed him.

00:18:48.117 --> 00:18:51.117
If the meeting had been held in a concrete

00:18:51.117 --> 00:18:54.117
bunker deep underground, like usual,

00:18:54.117 --> 00:18:56.117
instead of the venue being changed for

00:18:56.117 --> 00:18:59.117
a breezier, wooden room above ground, it

00:18:59.117 --> 00:19:02.097
would almost certainly have killed him, as

00:19:02.097 --> 00:19:03.121
the blast force would have been contained.

00:19:04.121 --> 00:19:06.128
If Hitler hadn’t been leaning

00:19:06.128 --> 00:19:09.272
over the table, it would almost

00:19:09.272 --> 00:19:17.412
certainly have killed him.

00:19:11.412 --> 00:19:13.622
And if Heinz Brandt hadn’t pushed

00:19:13.622 --> 00:19:15.867
the briefcase to one side, it would

00:19:15.867 --> 00:19:18.042
almost certainly have killed him.

00:19:18.077 --> 00:19:20.737
And if Hitler had been killed in

00:19:20.737 --> 00:19:23.127
the blast, it seems highly probable

00:19:23.287 --> 00:19:25.177
that Operation Valkyrie would

00:19:25.177 --> 00:19:27.407
have proceeded as it was intended.

00:19:28.137 --> 00:19:29.917
The reserve army would have

00:19:29.917 --> 00:19:32.277
arrested the supposedly “disloyal”

00:19:32.307 --> 00:19:34.177
elements within the Nazi party.

00:19:35.487 --> 00:19:38.097
Field Marshal Erwin von Witzleben would

00:19:38.107 --> 00:19:40.527
have become Commander-in-Chief; Germany

00:19:40.727 --> 00:19:43.837
may well have sought peace, and World War

00:19:43.837 --> 00:19:47.407
II might have ended in the summer of 1944.

00:19:48.907 --> 00:19:51.097
As you’ve heard, things didn’t

00:19:51.107 --> 00:19:53.307
work out that way, and the

00:19:53.317 --> 00:19:55.127
consequences were devastating.

00:19:55.817 --> 00:19:58.177
Between that hot July afternoon

00:19:58.397 --> 00:20:01.467
in 1944 and the end of the war the

00:20:01.467 --> 00:20:04.357
following May, another six to eight

00:20:04.357 --> 00:20:06.437
million people would lose their lives.

00:20:07.227 --> 00:20:09.747
If Hitler had died in the Wolf’s Lair that

00:20:09.757 --> 00:20:12.657
day, many of them might have been spared.

00:20:13.407 --> 00:20:16.977
Instead, the war raged on, and the failed

00:20:16.977 --> 00:20:20.007
coup of July 20th went down as one of

00:20:20.017 --> 00:20:22.807
history’s most haunting ‘what ifs’.

00:20:23.987 --> 00:20:25.827
OK, then, that is it for today's

00:20:25.827 --> 00:20:27.887
episode on Operation Valkyrie

00:20:28.117 --> 00:20:29.817
and the plot to kill Hitler.

00:20:30.527 --> 00:20:32.367
