Hello, hello, hello, and welcome

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.730
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.590
Minds, by Leonardo English, the show

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.399
where you can listen to fascinating

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.810
stories and learn weird and wonderful

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.850
things about the world at the same

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:20.610
time as improving your English.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.950
I'm Alastair Budge, and today it’s

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.230
part two of our mini-series on

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.590
the making of modern Saudi Arabia.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.150
In case you missed part one, it

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.560
was on Mohammed Bin Salman, MBS,

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.920
the Crown Prince, and the brains,

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.290
vision, and force behind it all.

00:00:38.849 --> 00:00:41.440
Next up, in part three, we’ll be

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.320
talking about the grisly murder

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.660
of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.570
But today it’s time to talk about

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.670
a project that has been placed at

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.139
the centre of this vision for the

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.409
Saudi Arabia of the future, a city so

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.550
ambitious its critics call it impossible.

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:02.770
NEOM, a desert city of the future.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.402
So let’s not waste a minute,

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.360
and get right into it.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.309
We’ve talked before about

00:01:10.309 --> 00:01:12.259
people’s impressions about what

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:14.310
the future might look like.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.320
If you look back at artists’ drawings

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.750
of “cities of the future”, people in

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.710
the 1920s imagining what a city in

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.110
the 2020s might look like, you are

00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:28.010
often met with drawings of flying

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.080
cars, people living in pods, their

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.500
every wish met by robot butlers.

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:38.680
The reality is that most cities of the

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.080
2020s aren’t so drastically different

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.519
to how they were 100 years ago.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.640
People still get around in cars, on

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.510
roads, they take buses, trams or subways.

00:01:53.059 --> 00:01:56.220
Buildings might be taller and made out

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.790
of different materials, and if you go

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.710
to some cities at night it might look

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.780
like a science-fiction movie, with

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.389
bright neon lights flashing everywhere.

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.819
But urban life hasn’t had the

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:13.150
seismic shift, the sea change,

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.070
that many had predicted.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.190
However, in October of 2017, at a

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.400
flashy investment conference in Riyadh,

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.099
Mohammed Bin Salman announced his

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.669
vision for the city of the future.

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.770
And this, well, it was

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.810
something very different.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.360
It was to be called NEOM, and would

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.421
cover an area of 26,500 square kilometres

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.989
in the northwest of the country, near

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.590
the borders with Jordan and Egypt,

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.640
and just across the water from Israel.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.529
It wasn’t just Saudi Arabia’s answer

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.490
to Dubai, it was something much bigger:

00:02:58.809 --> 00:03:02.020
a vast, independent economic zone

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.469
which would operate semi-independently

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:05.940
to the rest of the country.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.940
This was all part of the Vision 2030

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.200
plan, the strategy of diversifying

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.929
the Saudi economy away from oil.

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.429
As part of this, the NEOM region would be

00:03:21.429 --> 00:03:24.620
centred around nine specialised investment

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.550
sectors to, and I’m quoting directly,

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.090
“drive the future of human civilisation”.

00:03:32.367 --> 00:03:33.927
It would be funded by more

00:03:33.927 --> 00:03:36.787
than $500 billion from the

00:03:36.807 --> 00:03:38.767
Saudi Public Investment Fund.

00:03:39.337 --> 00:03:42.717
Sure, a lot of money, but for a country

00:03:42.827 --> 00:03:45.797
that was at times pumping $1 billion

00:03:45.797 --> 00:03:49.287
dollars worth of oil per day, it was

00:03:49.537 --> 00:03:51.537
within the realms of possibility.

00:03:52.447 --> 00:03:55.267
Now, when NEOM was first announced,

00:03:55.557 --> 00:03:57.706
there were a lot of buzzwords.

00:03:58.067 --> 00:04:00.647
Everything was to be handled by Artificial

00:04:00.647 --> 00:04:03.767
Intelligence, 100% of the energy would

00:04:03.767 --> 00:04:06.207
come from renewable sources, it was

00:04:06.207 --> 00:04:09.527
to be a “smart city like no other”.

00:04:10.817 --> 00:04:14.907
And for the first few years, NEOM remained

00:04:14.907 --> 00:04:17.287
a concept: something people talked

00:04:17.297 --> 00:04:20.317
about at conferences or in magazines.

00:04:21.027 --> 00:04:23.797
As far as any real construction, well

00:04:24.067 --> 00:04:27.424
the area remained a vast piece of desert,

00:04:27.527 --> 00:04:29.507
with a few construction sites the only

00:04:29.507 --> 00:04:31.687
sign of what was planned out for it.

00:04:32.817 --> 00:04:36.317
Then, in January 2021, came

00:04:36.317 --> 00:04:37.947
the announcement of what

00:04:37.947 --> 00:04:40.417
would be its centrepiece: a

00:04:40.447 --> 00:04:43.067
smart city called “The Line”.

00:04:44.107 --> 00:04:45.927
And although there are some other

00:04:46.047 --> 00:04:47.757
pretty interesting bits of the

00:04:47.757 --> 00:04:50.147
wider NEOM project, I’ll be talking

00:04:50.157 --> 00:04:52.287
mostly about The Line today.

00:04:53.277 --> 00:04:55.717
Now, most cities tend

00:04:55.727 --> 00:04:58.157
to be sort of circular.

00:04:58.547 --> 00:05:01.097
There is a centre, perhaps a historic

00:05:01.097 --> 00:05:04.387
centre, and the city grows out from that.

00:05:05.167 --> 00:05:06.527
There are exceptions, of

00:05:06.527 --> 00:05:08.777
course—geographical barriers like

00:05:08.907 --> 00:05:11.407
water or mountains might prevent

00:05:11.407 --> 00:05:13.827
a city from spreading out in every

00:05:13.827 --> 00:05:17.027
direction—but most cities naturally

00:05:17.027 --> 00:05:19.257
expand from a central point.

00:05:19.857 --> 00:05:21.777
The buildings in the centre, where

00:05:21.787 --> 00:05:23.957
land is in highest demand and

00:05:23.957 --> 00:05:25.947
therefore most expensive, tend to be

00:05:25.947 --> 00:05:27.867
the tallest, and that’s where most

00:05:27.907 --> 00:05:30.087
businesses and offices tend to be.

00:05:30.787 --> 00:05:33.117
Then as you move out from the centre,

00:05:33.457 --> 00:05:36.567
those tend to be more residential areas.

00:05:36.997 --> 00:05:38.777
Again, there are many exceptions

00:05:38.777 --> 00:05:40.727
to this, but this is how cities

00:05:40.917 --> 00:05:43.587
tend to develop organically.

00:05:44.537 --> 00:05:48.357
NEOM, and The Line, proposed to take

00:05:48.367 --> 00:05:51.027
this blueprint for urban society,

00:05:51.257 --> 00:05:54.327
this model for how almost every city

00:05:54.327 --> 00:05:57.867
is set out, and turn it on its head.

00:05:59.017 --> 00:06:02.087
Instead of a circle, the city would be

00:06:02.107 --> 00:06:05.367
a straight line, 170 kilometres long.

00:06:06.477 --> 00:06:08.767
But if you are thinking of just

00:06:08.787 --> 00:06:11.307
one long road, with shops and

00:06:11.307 --> 00:06:13.317
houses on each side, no no.

00:06:14.227 --> 00:06:16.247
This line would be one,

00:06:16.657 --> 00:06:19.827
massive skyscraper, towering

00:06:19.837 --> 00:06:22.667
500 metres up into the air.

00:06:24.367 --> 00:06:26.097
To give you a sense for quite how

00:06:26.137 --> 00:06:28.917
big that is, it’s like one and a half

00:06:29.007 --> 00:06:31.677
Eiffel Towers, taller than the very

00:06:31.737 --> 00:06:34.157
tip of the Empire State Building or

00:06:34.157 --> 00:06:35.657
the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur.

00:06:36.307 --> 00:06:37.737
It’s huge.

00:06:39.017 --> 00:06:42.507
And this wasn’t just one part, it was

00:06:42.507 --> 00:06:45.977
all of it, all 170 kilometres of it.

00:06:47.577 --> 00:06:49.977
The Line would consist of two long

00:06:49.977 --> 00:06:53.507
buildings, each 500 metres high, placed

00:06:53.557 --> 00:06:55.617
opposite each other, and connected

00:06:55.867 --> 00:06:58.587
by a series of walkways, bridges.

00:06:59.577 --> 00:07:01.857
The result would be this completely

00:07:01.867 --> 00:07:06.317
unique city: 170 kilometres in length, 500

00:07:06.327 --> 00:07:09.797
metres in height, and 200 metres in width.

00:07:10.487 --> 00:07:13.007
It would be like a massive glass

00:07:13.007 --> 00:07:15.877
wall, towering up from the desert.

00:07:16.977 --> 00:07:19.637
Its entire existence was based on

00:07:19.637 --> 00:07:22.117
the concept of something called Zero

00:07:22.357 --> 00:07:25.407
Gravity Urbanism, which is the idea that

00:07:25.407 --> 00:07:27.787
instead of extending only horizontally,

00:07:28.227 --> 00:07:31.127
cities should also extend vertically,

00:07:31.517 --> 00:07:33.607
stacked on top of each other, as

00:07:33.607 --> 00:07:36.197
if gravity had been cancelled out.

00:07:37.517 --> 00:07:39.937
This would mean that all residents

00:07:40.117 --> 00:07:41.877
would have access to every service

00:07:41.877 --> 00:07:44.917
they might need, from parks to shops

00:07:44.927 --> 00:07:47.197
to schools, as well as their place of

00:07:47.197 --> 00:07:50.497
work, all five-minutes from their home.

00:07:51.647 --> 00:07:53.857
And by doing this, you would

00:07:53.877 --> 00:07:55.757
eliminate the need for cars.

00:07:56.547 --> 00:07:58.537
Indeed, The Line would be

00:07:58.567 --> 00:08:00.707
completely car free; there

00:08:00.707 --> 00:08:02.377
wouldn’t even be a single road.

00:08:03.357 --> 00:08:05.057
There would be lifts, of course,

00:08:05.377 --> 00:08:07.117
but the only form of public

00:08:07.137 --> 00:08:09.297
transport would be a high-speed

00:08:09.317 --> 00:08:11.617
train which would run below ground.

00:08:12.957 --> 00:08:14.947
It was, at the risk of sounding

00:08:14.947 --> 00:08:17.487
cliche, a revolutionary idea.

00:08:18.677 --> 00:08:21.327
NEOM wasn't just about building a city;

00:08:21.637 --> 00:08:24.307
it was about demonstrating what an entire

00:08:24.307 --> 00:08:27.787
society, built from the ground up on

00:08:27.807 --> 00:08:30.317
futuristic principles, could achieve.

00:08:31.357 --> 00:08:34.757
And it wasn’t just an idea, a vision

00:08:34.767 --> 00:08:37.877
of some wacky architecture firm; Saudi

00:08:37.877 --> 00:08:40.537
Arabia had the cash to actually do

00:08:40.537 --> 00:08:42.867
it, or at least get started on it.

00:08:43.597 --> 00:08:46.667
Construction was already happening, and

00:08:46.907 --> 00:08:49.307
the plan was for it to eventually house

00:08:49.567 --> 00:08:53.067
9 million residents, around a quarter of

00:08:53.067 --> 00:08:54.767
the current population of the country.

00:08:55.767 --> 00:08:58.937
It was hugely ambitious, and we

00:08:58.937 --> 00:09:00.857
will come to the issues with such

00:09:00.857 --> 00:09:03.877
ambition in a few minutes, but first

00:09:04.077 --> 00:09:05.977
we need to underline one thing.

00:09:06.877 --> 00:09:09.777
The Line, and NEOM more generally,

00:09:10.097 --> 00:09:12.657
wasn’t just another megaproject

00:09:12.667 --> 00:09:14.407
dreamed up by a committee of urban

00:09:14.407 --> 00:09:17.167
planners, or an architecture firm

00:09:17.347 --> 00:09:19.227
with eyes on a fat commission.

00:09:20.307 --> 00:09:23.797
It was, reportedly, the personal vision

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:26.707
of Mohammed Bin Salman, the Crown Prince.

00:09:27.807 --> 00:09:29.227
The idea had come to him,

00:09:29.707 --> 00:09:31.407
according to a recent biography,

00:09:31.837 --> 00:09:34.487
in an almost Sim City-like way.

00:09:35.557 --> 00:09:37.997
He opened up Google Earth, zoomed

00:09:38.027 --> 00:09:40.577
in on Saudi Arabia, the country

00:09:40.657 --> 00:09:42.297
he knew he would one day rule.

00:09:43.057 --> 00:09:46.157
He saw this huge swathe of desert

00:09:46.407 --> 00:09:47.977
in the north west of the country.

00:09:49.087 --> 00:09:52.917
It was relatively unpopulated–only a few

00:09:53.107 --> 00:09:56.217
nomadic tribes–and not only did it have

00:09:56.227 --> 00:09:58.517
wonderful white beaches with coral reefs,

00:09:58.837 --> 00:10:01.607
but not far inland there were mountains

00:10:01.617 --> 00:10:04.347
so high that they even got snow in winter.

00:10:05.377 --> 00:10:08.667
And importantly, it was far away from

00:10:08.667 --> 00:10:11.297
the traditional centres of power in

00:10:11.297 --> 00:10:14.017
Saudi Arabia; Riyadh, the capital,

00:10:14.377 --> 00:10:17.017
and both Medina and Mecca–the two

00:10:17.027 --> 00:10:18.887
main religious sites–they were

00:10:18.897 --> 00:10:21.097
all hundreds of kilometres away.

00:10:22.037 --> 00:10:26.257
This area was a blank slate, perfect for

00:10:26.257 --> 00:10:28.777
a city that could be built from scratch

00:10:28.977 --> 00:10:31.087
without any of the baggage that might

00:10:31.087 --> 00:10:33.067
come from trying to build it elsewhere.

00:10:34.427 --> 00:10:37.257
Teams of expensive consultants were

00:10:37.277 --> 00:10:39.277
brought in to work on the projects,

00:10:39.547 --> 00:10:42.807
lured not only by the gargantuan fees

00:10:42.977 --> 00:10:44.317
that would come if they were chosen to

00:10:44.327 --> 00:10:47.387
lead the project, but also the prestige.

00:10:48.357 --> 00:10:51.657
After all, this was the most ambitious

00:10:51.937 --> 00:10:54.577
urban planning project in the world,

00:10:55.017 --> 00:10:57.717
perhaps even in human history.

00:10:59.057 --> 00:11:00.767
With extensive back and forth

00:11:00.977 --> 00:11:02.877
between groups of consultants and

00:11:02.887 --> 00:11:05.527
MBS himself the vision statement

00:11:05.697 --> 00:11:07.317
for the project was chosen:

00:11:07.947 --> 00:11:09.807
“The land of the future, where the

00:11:09.807 --> 00:11:12.167
greatest minds and best talents

00:11:12.397 --> 00:11:15.077
are empowered to embody pioneering

00:11:15.077 --> 00:11:17.887
ideas and exceed boundaries in a

00:11:17.897 --> 00:11:20.667
world inspired by imagination”.

00:11:22.077 --> 00:11:23.467
Now, there is a lot of

00:11:23.477 --> 00:11:24.827
management consultant-speak

00:11:24.827 --> 00:11:27.857
there, but it isn’t all fluff.

00:11:28.937 --> 00:11:31.657
Key to this entire project was

00:11:31.697 --> 00:11:35.157
MBS’s firm belief that NEOM, and

00:11:35.167 --> 00:11:38.217
The Line, wasn’t simply his vanity

00:11:38.217 --> 00:11:40.367
project; it was to be an attractive

00:11:40.577 --> 00:11:42.887
investment opportunity for foreigners.

00:11:44.117 --> 00:11:46.457
See, there was no shortage of foreign

00:11:46.457 --> 00:11:48.977
companies that would happily take Saudi

00:11:48.977 --> 00:11:52.507
cash, but there was a serious shortage

00:11:52.787 --> 00:11:54.767
of foreign companies who wanted to

00:11:54.807 --> 00:11:57.827
invest in Saudi Arabia, who wanted

00:11:57.827 --> 00:11:59.917
to put their money into the country.

00:12:00.627 --> 00:12:04.127
This wasn’t right, MBS thought; Saudi

00:12:04.127 --> 00:12:06.037
Arabia was the biggest country in

00:12:06.037 --> 00:12:08.697
the Middle East by land area, and

00:12:08.937 --> 00:12:11.147
was projected to have a population of

00:12:11.187 --> 00:12:14.387
almost 50 million by the year 2050.

00:12:14.877 --> 00:12:17.377
Its population was young and

00:12:17.377 --> 00:12:20.157
increasingly educated and affluent.

00:12:21.217 --> 00:12:24.297
And up until now, there had been limited

00:12:24.297 --> 00:12:26.787
ways for Saudis to spend their money

00:12:26.867 --> 00:12:30.437
in the country; many, especially rich

00:12:30.457 --> 00:12:33.957
Saudis, preferred to go abroad, leading

00:12:33.957 --> 00:12:36.227
to hundreds of billions of dollars in

00:12:36.577 --> 00:12:40.017
“economic leakage”, as MBS put it; money

00:12:40.207 --> 00:12:42.397
that was spent outside Saudi Arabia

00:12:42.697 --> 00:12:45.217
that should be spent domestically.

00:12:46.547 --> 00:12:50.027
Having an area like NEOM, which not only

00:12:50.037 --> 00:12:51.807
brought foreigners and foreign investment

00:12:52.127 --> 00:12:55.027
into Saudi Arabia but stopped Saudis

00:12:55.037 --> 00:12:56.607
from heading abroad to spend their money,

00:12:57.157 --> 00:12:59.827
well, this would help solve the problem.

00:13:01.047 --> 00:13:03.057
And NEOM and The Line

00:13:03.507 --> 00:13:05.447
did sound pretty unique.

00:13:06.027 --> 00:13:08.147
A city with no cars.

00:13:08.327 --> 00:13:10.227
A city where everything is

00:13:10.227 --> 00:13:11.617
within a five-minute walk.

00:13:12.087 --> 00:13:15.547
A city powered entirely by clean energy.

00:13:16.137 --> 00:13:19.587
A city where AI—not humans—controls

00:13:19.587 --> 00:13:21.837
basic functions like logistics,

00:13:21.987 --> 00:13:24.107
maintenance, and power distribution.

00:13:24.757 --> 00:13:26.447
A city where the climate is

00:13:26.447 --> 00:13:28.777
moderated by technology, meaning

00:13:28.777 --> 00:13:31.307
temperatures inside The Line would

00:13:31.317 --> 00:13:33.687
be cooler than the desert outside.

00:13:34.747 --> 00:13:37.197
To supporters, it was thrilling.

00:13:37.557 --> 00:13:39.807
A blank canvas on which you could

00:13:39.807 --> 00:13:43.187
rethink human civilisation from scratch.

00:13:44.487 --> 00:13:46.547
To critics, it was something else

00:13:46.547 --> 00:13:49.847
entirely—a sort of science fiction fever

00:13:49.847 --> 00:13:52.187
dream, the urban-planning equivalent

00:13:52.447 --> 00:13:54.747
of “the emperor’s new clothes”, where

00:13:54.747 --> 00:13:57.637
everyone knows something is true but is

00:13:57.637 --> 00:14:00.107
afraid to admit it, for fear of upsetting

00:14:00.107 --> 00:14:02.167
the person in charge, and certainly in

00:14:02.167 --> 00:14:04.587
this case, the person paying the bills.

00:14:05.627 --> 00:14:07.757
Because, to state the obvious,

00:14:08.137 --> 00:14:10.557
building a 170-kilometre-long,

00:14:10.907 --> 00:14:13.767
500 metre high skyscraper in the

00:14:13.767 --> 00:14:16.667
middle of the desert is…complicated.

00:14:17.507 --> 00:14:19.867
The graphics, the videos, and the

00:14:19.877 --> 00:14:22.247
marketing materials might make it look

00:14:22.327 --> 00:14:25.707
sleek, futuristic and almost magically

00:14:25.717 --> 00:14:28.737
simple, but it is anything but.

00:14:30.077 --> 00:14:32.397
According to some engineers, much

00:14:32.427 --> 00:14:35.267
of it is physically impossible on

00:14:35.297 --> 00:14:37.057
anything like the promised scale.

00:14:38.047 --> 00:14:40.717
So, let’s start with the basics.

00:14:41.457 --> 00:14:43.717
Simply sourcing the materials for

00:14:43.717 --> 00:14:46.547
The Line is a gargantuan task.

00:14:47.527 --> 00:14:49.877
Some analysts have calculated that the

00:14:49.877 --> 00:14:53.397
demand for steel, glass and concrete would

00:14:53.407 --> 00:14:56.327
be so high it would distort the global

00:14:56.337 --> 00:14:59.307
market, inflating costs for construction

00:14:59.307 --> 00:15:02.197
projects everywhere else on Earth.

00:15:02.977 --> 00:15:04.877
The foundations alone would be

00:15:04.877 --> 00:15:06.747
one of the biggest construction

00:15:06.747 --> 00:15:08.607
challenges in human history.

00:15:09.687 --> 00:15:12.667
Then you have the environmental questions.

00:15:13.387 --> 00:15:16.817
A 170-kilometre mirrored facade in

00:15:16.817 --> 00:15:18.827
the middle of a desert—what would

00:15:18.827 --> 00:15:21.317
that do to the local environment?

00:15:21.317 --> 00:15:22.607
To the heat of the

00:15:22.607 --> 00:15:23.607
surrounding environment?

00:15:24.047 --> 00:15:24.817
To birds?

00:15:25.377 --> 00:15:27.157
It would be right in the middle of a

00:15:27.167 --> 00:15:30.267
migratory flight path, and to state the

00:15:30.267 --> 00:15:32.887
obvious, this is a little different to

00:15:32.887 --> 00:15:36.217
a small wind farm; it’s a 170 kilometre

00:15:36.227 --> 00:15:40.317
wall, stretching 500 metres up in the air.

00:15:41.317 --> 00:15:42.947
Some environmental scientists

00:15:43.107 --> 00:15:46.157
warned of mass bird deaths

00:15:46.317 --> 00:15:48.377
on a scale never seen before.

00:15:49.557 --> 00:15:51.957
Then there were the human questions.

00:15:52.597 --> 00:15:54.707
The area might look empty on Google Earth,

00:15:54.977 --> 00:15:57.437
but there were still small settlements

00:15:57.457 --> 00:15:59.937
and nomadic tribes that called it home.

00:16:00.837 --> 00:16:01.797
What would happen to them?

00:16:02.967 --> 00:16:05.217
There were temporary but no less

00:16:05.247 --> 00:16:07.667
important questions about the rights

00:16:07.847 --> 00:16:09.797
of the hundreds of thousands of migrant

00:16:09.797 --> 00:16:11.837
construction workers who would be brought

00:16:11.837 --> 00:16:13.887
in to make this project a reality.

00:16:14.947 --> 00:16:17.187
If working conditions were anything

00:16:17.227 --> 00:16:19.207
like those seen in other regional

00:16:19.207 --> 00:16:21.577
megaprojects, critics warned that

00:16:21.587 --> 00:16:23.567
the human cost of this futuristic

00:16:23.567 --> 00:16:25.667
dream could be staggeringly high.

00:16:27.097 --> 00:16:30.437
And as for the city itself, the projected

00:16:30.437 --> 00:16:33.427
population was to be nine million people.

00:16:34.667 --> 00:16:37.197
Was that in any way realistic?

00:16:37.757 --> 00:16:39.703
Would people want to live there,

00:16:39.887 --> 00:16:42.637
in a vertical, enclosed city?

00:16:44.034 --> 00:16:45.877
Urban planners pointed out that

00:16:45.877 --> 00:16:48.267
most successful cities grow

00:16:48.317 --> 00:16:51.167
organically, adapting to geography,

00:16:51.517 --> 00:16:53.557
culture, and economic demands.

00:16:54.277 --> 00:16:57.317
The Line was the opposite: an entirely

00:16:57.397 --> 00:17:00.577
artificial plan, imposed from above,

00:17:00.877 --> 00:17:03.147
with no clear historical parallel.

00:17:04.357 --> 00:17:06.717
Critics compared it to building

00:17:06.717 --> 00:17:09.057
a city inside a shopping mall.

00:17:10.627 --> 00:17:13.147
And then there were all the smaller

00:17:13.327 --> 00:17:15.257
but no-less-important questions of

00:17:15.257 --> 00:17:17.507
things like what happens in a fire?

00:17:18.217 --> 00:17:19.157
Where would the rubbish go?

00:17:19.577 --> 00:17:20.897
How would insurance work?

00:17:21.527 --> 00:17:23.227
If the fast train to the airport

00:17:23.617 --> 00:17:25.927
didn’t have baggage storage, how would

00:17:25.927 --> 00:17:27.757
people get their bags to the airport?

00:17:28.947 --> 00:17:30.537
And then, of course, there

00:17:30.537 --> 00:17:32.087
was the question of cost.

00:17:32.897 --> 00:17:34.037
The original estimate

00:17:34.337 --> 00:17:37.157
was around $500 billion.

00:17:37.357 --> 00:17:38.617
A huge amount of money,

00:17:39.127 --> 00:17:40.327
even for Saudi Arabia.

00:17:41.397 --> 00:17:43.698
But unofficial figures leaked from

00:17:43.698 --> 00:17:45.753
within the project suggested costs

00:17:45.763 --> 00:17:49.233
could reach $1 trillion, possibly

00:17:49.233 --> 00:17:51.033
even one and a half trillion dollars.

00:17:51.937 --> 00:17:54.367
Most staggeringly recent reports

00:17:54.517 --> 00:17:57.237
indicate the final cost for the full

00:17:57.327 --> 00:18:00.327
170 kilometres of The Line alone

00:18:00.567 --> 00:18:04.887
could eventually hit $8.8 trillion.

00:18:05.587 --> 00:18:07.957
Saudi Arabia is extremely wealthy,

00:18:08.077 --> 00:18:10.597
but even for a petro state,

00:18:10.897 --> 00:18:12.727
these numbers are staggering.

00:18:13.597 --> 00:18:16.087
And then we come to the progress.

00:18:16.747 --> 00:18:19.777
For all the glossy promotional videos,

00:18:20.017 --> 00:18:22.867
drone shots, and futuristic renderings.

00:18:23.107 --> 00:18:25.147
Many analysts noticed something

00:18:25.152 --> 00:18:27.547
else: the actual construction

00:18:27.817 --> 00:18:29.857
seemed incredibly slow.

00:18:30.742 --> 00:18:33.352
Satellite imagery showed foundations

00:18:33.352 --> 00:18:35.872
being laid, structures being started,

00:18:36.202 --> 00:18:38.632
but nothing remotely close to the

00:18:38.632 --> 00:18:41.332
rapid pace promised in the early years.

00:18:41.992 --> 00:18:44.302
Meanwhile, some of those satellite

00:18:44.302 --> 00:18:46.432
images revealed that construction

00:18:46.432 --> 00:18:49.132
resources had been diverted to

00:18:49.132 --> 00:18:51.532
build a massive royal palace with

00:18:51.532 --> 00:18:53.757
16 buildings and a golf course.

00:18:55.012 --> 00:18:59.572
In late 2023 and throughout 2024, reports

00:18:59.572 --> 00:19:02.582
began emerging that the 170  kilometre

00:19:02.632 --> 00:19:05.932
plan had quietly been scaled back.

00:19:06.952 --> 00:19:09.502
Initially the target was revised

00:19:09.652 --> 00:19:12.112
to complete around 16  kilometres

00:19:12.352 --> 00:19:16.192
by 2030 with the full 170 to

00:19:16.192 --> 00:19:17.812
be finished sometime later.

00:19:18.532 --> 00:19:22.342
But by April, 2024, even that

00:19:22.342 --> 00:19:25.342
reduced target proved too ambitious.

00:19:26.272 --> 00:19:29.392
Officials slashed the 2030 completion

00:19:29.392 --> 00:19:32.812
target from 16  kilometres down to a

00:19:32.812 --> 00:19:37.702
mere 2.4  kilometres, just 1.4% of the

00:19:37.702 --> 00:19:40.762
originally planned 170  kilometre city.

00:19:41.462 --> 00:19:44.972
The population target for 2030 was also

00:19:44.972 --> 00:19:47.642
cut dramatically from one and a half

00:19:47.642 --> 00:19:50.762
million residents down to just 300,000.

00:19:51.812 --> 00:19:54.062
And the timing for completing

00:19:54.062 --> 00:19:56.132
the full 170  kilometres?

00:19:56.612 --> 00:20:00.182
That was pushed back from 2030 all the way

00:20:00.182 --> 00:20:04.352
to 2045, another 21 years into the future.

00:20:05.052 --> 00:20:07.452
So there were all these reports that

00:20:07.452 --> 00:20:10.152
things were quietly being scaled back.

00:20:11.172 --> 00:20:14.412
And in November of 2025, there was

00:20:14.412 --> 00:20:16.872
a bombshell report by the Financial

00:20:16.872 --> 00:20:20.742
Times titled End of the Line, how

00:20:20.742 --> 00:20:23.892
Saudi Arabia's NEOM Dream Unraveled.

00:20:24.822 --> 00:20:27.912
This long report painted a picture of

00:20:27.912 --> 00:20:31.102
a hugely ambitious project that, at

00:20:31.122 --> 00:20:34.002
almost every point, came up against

00:20:34.002 --> 00:20:37.752
the laws of physics and with a sponsor

00:20:37.992 --> 00:20:40.332
that didn't take no for an answer, and

00:20:40.452 --> 00:20:43.062
with a large vested interest in keeping

00:20:43.062 --> 00:20:45.912
the project going, few people involved

00:20:46.062 --> 00:20:48.282
seemed prepared to tell the truth.

00:20:49.302 --> 00:20:52.782
MBS clearly revelled in the idea that he

00:20:52.782 --> 00:20:54.732
would be able to push through a project

00:20:54.942 --> 00:20:57.582
that so many critics said was impossible.

00:20:58.002 --> 00:21:01.242
And if he could pull it off, well,

00:21:01.422 --> 00:21:03.432
it might be expensive, but it would

00:21:03.432 --> 00:21:05.802
be transformational for the country

00:21:06.012 --> 00:21:08.502
and forever cement his legacy.

00:21:09.672 --> 00:21:12.432
But then something changed.

00:21:13.212 --> 00:21:16.662
In January of 2026, just a few weeks

00:21:16.662 --> 00:21:19.542
ago, there was the first big announcement

00:21:19.722 --> 00:21:21.742
regarding the future of NEOM.

00:21:22.782 --> 00:21:24.642
It was announced that following

00:21:24.642 --> 00:21:27.222
a year long strategic review, the

00:21:27.222 --> 00:21:29.892
project is undergoing what officials

00:21:29.892 --> 00:21:32.892
call a fundamental re-imagining.

00:21:33.942 --> 00:21:36.312
The Line is to be redesigned

00:21:36.552 --> 00:21:38.472
into something far more modest

00:21:38.682 --> 00:21:39.972
than originally planned.

00:21:41.112 --> 00:21:44.262
The focus appears to be shifting away

00:21:44.262 --> 00:21:47.202
from the futuristic, linear city concept

00:21:47.502 --> 00:21:50.562
towards something more practical: a hub

00:21:50.712 --> 00:21:53.742
for data centres to support Saudi Arabia's

00:21:53.742 --> 00:21:56.112
push into artificial intelligence.

00:21:56.812 --> 00:21:59.242
In other words, the grand vision of

00:21:59.242 --> 00:22:01.882
a car-free climate-controlled city,

00:22:02.122 --> 00:22:04.402
where 9 million people would live in

00:22:04.402 --> 00:22:07.492
a mirrored skyscraper stretching 170

00:22:07.492 --> 00:22:09.922
kilometres through the desert is being

00:22:09.922 --> 00:22:13.252
quietly abandoned in favour of massive

00:22:13.252 --> 00:22:16.012
server farms with a view of the Red Sea.

00:22:17.122 --> 00:22:18.682
And that's not all.

00:22:19.372 --> 00:22:21.832
The Asian Winter Games, which were

00:22:21.832 --> 00:22:24.892
supposed to be held at an all new

00:22:24.952 --> 00:22:28.252
custom built NEOM ski resort in 2029

00:22:28.598 --> 00:22:31.058
have been indefinitely postponed.

00:22:31.748 --> 00:22:34.178
Now, part of what forced this

00:22:34.178 --> 00:22:37.208
rethinking was simple economics.

00:22:38.048 --> 00:22:40.838
Oil prices have fallen significantly

00:22:41.048 --> 00:22:42.908
since NEOM was first announced.

00:22:43.778 --> 00:22:45.783
According to Bloomberg, Saudi

00:22:45.783 --> 00:22:49.008
Arabia needs oil at almost $100 a

00:22:49.008 --> 00:22:51.168
barrel just to balance its budget,

00:22:51.528 --> 00:22:55.518
and at $113 per barrel to fund the

00:22:55.518 --> 00:22:57.708
Crown Prince's ambitious projects.

00:22:58.608 --> 00:23:01.428
Oil is currently at around $60 a

00:23:01.428 --> 00:23:04.278
barrel, so significantly below where

00:23:04.278 --> 00:23:06.955
it needs to be, and with the country

00:23:06.985 --> 00:23:09.865
also facing major costs for hosting

00:23:09.865 --> 00:23:13.675
the 2030 World Expo and 2034 FIFA

00:23:13.675 --> 00:23:16.070
World Cup, something had to give.

00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:21.310
For Mohammed bin Salman for MBS, this

00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:24.490
represents a significant personal setback.

00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:26.590
It was his brainchild.

00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:29.770
NEOM was supposed to be the crown jewel

00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:33.110
of his Vision 2030, the project that

00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:36.440
would define his legacy and prove Saudi

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:38.720
Arabia could build the impossible.

00:23:39.875 --> 00:23:42.425
And yet,  this recent announcement

00:23:42.725 --> 00:23:45.680
was an admission that it couldn't,

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:47.885
or at least it couldn't just yet.

00:23:48.585 --> 00:23:51.090
So to wrap things up, who knows

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:53.565
what the future holds for this most

00:23:53.565 --> 00:23:55.695
ambitious of urban planning projects.

00:23:56.550 --> 00:24:00.240
Perhaps by 2045 when the full Line is now

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:02.610
theoretically scheduled to be completed,

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.150
some version of this dream will exist.

00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:08.550
Perhaps you'll be listening to this

00:24:08.550 --> 00:24:11.400
episode from a modest section of a

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:13.980
futuristic linear city on the Red Sea

00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:16.650
Coast, powered by renewable energy

00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:19.410
and surrounded by data centres quietly

00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:21.360
humming away in the desert heat.

00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:25.010
Or perhaps in 20 years time, the region

00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:27.050
will be dotted with half finished

00:24:27.050 --> 00:24:30.320
foundations and rusting steel, a memorial

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:33.110
to one of the most ambitious and most

00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:35.265
expensive follies in human history.

00:24:36.545 --> 00:24:38.855
Say what you want about NEOM, it

00:24:38.855 --> 00:24:41.675
certainly is of unparalleled ambition,

00:24:42.275 --> 00:24:45.515
but ambition, it turns out, is not

00:24:45.515 --> 00:24:48.005
enough to build a city in the sky.

00:24:50.125 --> 00:24:51.955
OK, then, that is it for today's

00:24:51.955 --> 00:24:54.585
episode on NEOM and The Line, this

00:24:54.585 --> 00:24:56.335
science fiction city of the future.

00:24:56.735 --> 00:24:57.985
I hope it's been an interesting one

00:24:58.271 --> 00:24:59.865
and that you've learnt something new.

00:25:00.325 --> 00:25:02.045
As always, I would love to know

00:25:02.055 --> 00:25:03.355
what you thought of this episode.

00:25:03.675 --> 00:25:05.235
If you are from Saudi Arabia,

00:25:05.565 --> 00:25:07.155
what do you think about this plan?

00:25:07.485 --> 00:25:10.155
Will some version of it come off, or

00:25:10.335 --> 00:25:12.075
do you think your country's resources

00:25:12.285 --> 00:25:14.265
would be better off spent elsewhere?

00:25:14.315 --> 00:25:15.725
And for everyone else,

00:25:15.965 --> 00:25:17.695
would you move to The Line?

00:25:17.985 --> 00:25:19.835
How would you feel about living

00:25:19.845 --> 00:25:22.255
in a 500 metre tall smart city?

00:25:22.825 --> 00:25:24.315
I would love to know, so let’s

00:25:24.315 --> 00:25:25.625
get this discussion started.

00:25:25.885 --> 00:25:26.915
You can head right into our

00:25:26.915 --> 00:25:28.535
community forum, which is at

00:25:31.065 --> 00:25:33.235
chatting away to other curious minds.

00:25:33.665 --> 00:25:35.985
And as a final reminder, this was

00:25:35.985 --> 00:25:38.405
part two of a three-part mini-series

00:25:38.485 --> 00:25:40.425
on the making of modern Saudi Arabia.

00:25:40.905 --> 00:25:43.245
Part one was on the rise and life

00:25:43.245 --> 00:25:45.775
so far of its Crown Prince, Mohammed

00:25:45.775 --> 00:25:48.425
Bin Salman, and next up, part three

00:25:48.625 --> 00:25:50.395
is going to be on the grisly murder

00:25:50.615 --> 00:25:52.575
of the journalist Jamal Khashogi.

00:25:53.535 --> 00:25:55.305
You've been listening to English Learning

00:25:58.375 --> 00:26:01.115
I'm Alastair Budge, you stay safe, and

00:26:01.115 --> 00:26:03.375
I'll catch you in the next episode.
