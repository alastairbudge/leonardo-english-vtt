Hello, hello, hello, and welcome

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:10.009
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:12.939
Minds, by Leonardo English, the show

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:14.739
where you can listen to fascinating

00:00:14.739 --> 00:00:17.609
stories and learn weird and wonderful

00:00:17.629 --> 00:00:19.599
things about the world at the same

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:21.389
time as improving your English.

00:00:21.879 --> 00:00:25.139
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are

00:00:25.139 --> 00:00:27.849
going to be talking about DOGE, the

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:30.459
Department of Governmental Efficiency.

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.869
It was established by Executive

00:00:32.869 --> 00:00:34.969
Order on Donald Trump’s first

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:36.959
day back in office and has been

00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:39.419
plagued by controversy ever since.

00:00:39.569 --> 00:00:42.079
So, in this episode, we’ll look at what

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:44.779
it did, what it still does, why it is

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.449
loved and loathed in almost equal measure,

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:50.129
and ask ourselves what happens next.

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:52.769
OK then, let’s get right

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:55.119
into it and talk about DOGE.

00:00:57.139 --> 00:01:00.399
On Saturday, 22nd February, earlier

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:02.969
this year, millions of American

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:05.839
federal employees got the same email.

00:01:06.629 --> 00:01:09.869
It was, on one level, a simple request.

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.269
It asked them to list five things

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:14.809
that they achieved that week.

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:16.799
They shouldn’t disclose any

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:18.659
classified information, and

00:01:18.879 --> 00:01:20.739
simple bullet points were fine.

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:25.429
The email came from the OPM, the Office

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:27.779
of Personnel Management, which is the

00:01:27.779 --> 00:01:30.749
US government’s human resources agency.

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:33.759
However, a quick glance at social

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:36.329
media revealed the ultimate source

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:38.499
of the email and the potential

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:40.969
consequences of not responding.

00:01:42.269 --> 00:01:46.319
At 8.30 pm that evening, Elon Musk

00:01:46.589 --> 00:01:49.769
posted on X, “Consistent with President

00:01:49.769 --> 00:01:52.009
@realDonaldTrump’s instructions, all

00:01:52.019 --> 00:01:54.439
federal employees will shortly receive

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:57.479
an email requesting to understand what

00:01:57.489 --> 00:02:00.289
they got done last week. Failure to

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:03.599
respond will be taken as a resignation.”

00:02:05.059 --> 00:02:07.959
This was just over a month into the

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:10.759
establishment of DOGE, the Department

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.469
of Governmental Efficiency, and was

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:15.739
one of its most controversial acts.

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.529
To some, it was a perfectly fair request.

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:22.399
These were federal employees, people

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:25.569
whose salaries are paid by taxpayers, so

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:27.959
they should be answerable to the public.

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:30.609
And this was hardly a difficult

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:32.749
question to answer: list five

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:34.369
things they did that week.

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.269
To others, it was a crude,

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:40.599
politically-charged request, an act of

00:02:40.649 --> 00:02:43.899
intimidation dressed up as accountability,

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:47.399
less about measuring productivity and more

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:50.259
about reminding people who held the power.

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:53.629
And there was immediate confusion

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:56.319
among federal employees, the government

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.049
workers who received the email.

00:02:59.089 --> 00:03:00.219
Should they respond?

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:02.729
What would happen if they didn’t?

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:06.269
Some heads of federal agencies instructed

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.519
their employees not to respond,

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:11.479
others instructed them to respond,

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:14.479
others to respond, but to their direct

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.659
manager, not to the original email.

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:20.709
Later that week, it was reported that

00:03:20.749 --> 00:03:24.359
around 1 million federal employees had

00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:26.969
responded to the email, but that still

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:30.979
left around 1.5 million who had not.

00:03:32.435 --> 00:03:35.395
One of those who did respond was the White

00:03:35.415 --> 00:03:38.595
House Press Secretary, Karoline Leavitt.

00:03:39.405 --> 00:03:41.665
She proudly declared that she had

00:03:41.665 --> 00:03:44.455
responded, saying, “I do five things in

00:03:44.455 --> 00:03:47.365
about 10 minutes, and all federal workers

00:03:47.565 --> 00:03:49.775
should be working at the same pace that

00:03:49.775 --> 00:03:51.625
President Trump is working and moving.

00:03:51.985 --> 00:03:54.505
We have a country to save, and we want

00:03:54.535 --> 00:03:56.925
this federal government to be responsive

00:03:57.135 --> 00:03:59.005
to the needs of the American people.”

00:04:00.225 --> 00:04:03.915
The message was clear:  to “Make America

00:04:03.935 --> 00:04:06.645
Great Again”, lazy federal employees

00:04:06.855 --> 00:04:09.035
needed to pick up the pace, and the

00:04:09.035 --> 00:04:11.545
waste and inefficiency that had been

00:04:11.545 --> 00:04:14.285
tolerated under previous administrations,

00:04:14.555 --> 00:04:17.755
both Democratic and Republican, was

00:04:17.765 --> 00:04:20.155
no longer going to cut the mustard.

00:04:20.685 --> 00:04:23.315
America needed to be saved, and

00:04:23.395 --> 00:04:25.895
everyone had to pull their weight.

00:04:26.865 --> 00:04:29.605
Now, before we get to the question of

00:04:29.615 --> 00:04:32.685
how much waste and inefficiency there

00:04:32.685 --> 00:04:35.035
is thought to have been, and some

00:04:35.135 --> 00:04:37.905
theories about the motivations behind

00:04:37.915 --> 00:04:40.845
the organisation set up to combat it, we

00:04:40.845 --> 00:04:43.875
must go back to the start, to well before

00:04:43.875 --> 00:04:46.395
January 20th, the day that Donald Trump

00:04:46.615 --> 00:04:48.915
was inaugurated for his second term.

00:04:49.735 --> 00:04:52.285
In fact, we need to go all the way

00:04:52.285 --> 00:04:55.465
back to before Trump even became the

00:04:55.465 --> 00:04:58.702
Republican nominee for the 2024 election.

00:04:59.925 --> 00:05:03.315
In September 2023, when multiple

00:05:03.315 --> 00:05:06.015
candidates were still vying for the

00:05:06.015 --> 00:05:08.735
Republican nomination, a fundraising

00:05:08.735 --> 00:05:11.851
dinner was held at a former Facebook

00:05:11.851 --> 00:05:13.975
executive’s Silicon Valley mansion.

00:05:15.165 --> 00:05:18.865
It was a $50,000-a-head fundraiser,

00:05:19.155 --> 00:05:21.145
raising money for the campaign

00:05:21.175 --> 00:05:22.745
of the former healthcare

00:05:22.825 --> 00:05:25.445
entrepreneur, Vivek Ramaswamy.

00:05:26.584 --> 00:05:28.755
Elon Musk was one of the guests.

00:05:29.855 --> 00:05:33.395
As the evening went on, Musk started

00:05:33.435 --> 00:05:36.995
musing on the idea of radically reducing

00:05:37.005 --> 00:05:39.195
the size of the federal government.

00:05:40.495 --> 00:05:42.525
He had bought Twitter a year

00:05:42.565 --> 00:05:45.215
earlier and had embarked on a

00:05:45.215 --> 00:05:47.215
radical cost-cutting mission,

00:05:47.695 --> 00:05:50.915
culling more than 80% of the staff.

00:05:52.065 --> 00:05:54.535
Despite the cries from critics that this

00:05:54.535 --> 00:05:57.395
would be the end of Twitter, that Musk

00:05:57.455 --> 00:05:59.495
didn’t have the relevant experience with

00:05:59.525 --> 00:06:02.295
consumer software or social media to make

00:06:02.295 --> 00:06:05.825
it a success, Twitter — since rebranded

00:06:05.825 --> 00:06:08.965
as X — didn’t die a painful death.

00:06:10.005 --> 00:06:13.615
A flood of advertisers did leave, and it

00:06:13.625 --> 00:06:16.085
has had its fair share of growing pains,

00:06:16.405 --> 00:06:20.105
but it actually has more active users now

00:06:20.405 --> 00:06:23.775
than it did before Elon Musk bought it.

00:06:24.795 --> 00:06:27.525
Musk theorised that he could embark

00:06:27.525 --> 00:06:30.105
on the same extreme cost-cutting

00:06:30.105 --> 00:06:32.535
measures at a governmental level.

00:06:33.465 --> 00:06:36.665
And just think of the savings to be made.

00:06:37.435 --> 00:06:39.735
Twitter might not have been the most

00:06:39.735 --> 00:06:42.425
efficient company, but it was surely

00:06:42.525 --> 00:06:44.555
much more efficient than any government.

00:06:45.425 --> 00:06:48.245
And the numbers were vastly different:

00:06:48.865 --> 00:06:52.655
Twitter had 8,000 or so employees, the

00:06:52.655 --> 00:06:55.915
federal government had around 3 million.

00:06:57.465 --> 00:06:59.965
It was a different scale, a less

00:06:59.985 --> 00:07:02.965
efficient and vastly larger beast, and

00:07:03.215 --> 00:07:05.765
all of these savings could be passed

00:07:05.985 --> 00:07:08.235
right back to the American people.

00:07:09.445 --> 00:07:11.585
This wasn’t a political challenge,

00:07:11.735 --> 00:07:13.425
a question of persuading

00:07:13.425 --> 00:07:15.315
congressmen and women to support

00:07:15.365 --> 00:07:17.305
the cuts at a political level.

00:07:17.695 --> 00:07:20.375
It was a technological challenge, he said.

00:07:21.005 --> 00:07:23.445
Give me access to the systems, let me

00:07:23.445 --> 00:07:26.635
in, and I will find the waste and cut it.

00:07:28.008 --> 00:07:31.478
Now, Musk never officially supported

00:07:31.688 --> 00:07:34.358
Ramaswamy, and early the following

00:07:34.358 --> 00:07:36.548
year, he dropped out of the Republican

00:07:36.548 --> 00:07:38.898
nomination race and officially

00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.188
pledged support to Donald Trump.

00:07:42.158 --> 00:07:45.988
On July 13th, 2024, the same day as

00:07:45.988 --> 00:07:48.588
the attempted assassination, Elon Musk

00:07:48.828 --> 00:07:51.468
publicly tweeted out his support for

00:07:51.498 --> 00:07:53.378
Donald Trump’s presidential campaign.

00:07:54.608 --> 00:07:57.148
As you will remember, Musk ended up

00:07:57.158 --> 00:07:59.468
becoming Trump’s largest financial

00:07:59.478 --> 00:08:04.038
backer, spending $290 million to

00:08:04.038 --> 00:08:06.048
help Donald Trump win re-election.

00:08:07.228 --> 00:08:10.048
This isn’t the time to speculate about his

00:08:10.048 --> 00:08:13.738
motivations for this, but before long, the

00:08:13.738 --> 00:08:16.868
two men appeared to be joined at the hip.

00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:21.468
And one of Trump’s campaign pledges was

00:08:21.468 --> 00:08:25.158
to bring in Elon Musk to lead a task force

00:08:25.488 --> 00:08:28.138
aimed at reducing government spending.

00:08:29.226 --> 00:08:32.788
This was, in many ways, a continuation

00:08:32.968 --> 00:08:35.538
of his earlier pledge to “drain

00:08:35.538 --> 00:08:39.318
the swamp”, but now it seemed less

00:08:39.408 --> 00:08:41.728
politically-motivated, more about

00:08:41.728 --> 00:08:44.088
using taxpayer money more efficiently

00:08:44.298 --> 00:08:46.858
and for American interests rather

00:08:46.858 --> 00:08:49.358
than targeting career politicians.

00:08:50.388 --> 00:08:52.568
And sure enough, Trump was re-elected,

00:08:52.918 --> 00:08:55.468
and on his first day in office, he

00:08:55.468 --> 00:08:58.058
signed an Executive Order establishing

00:08:58.058 --> 00:08:59.898
the Department of Governmental

00:08:59.948 --> 00:09:02.008
Efficiency - DOGE, for short.

00:09:03.358 --> 00:09:05.338
As you might know, the acronym

00:09:05.378 --> 00:09:07.808
DOGE is somewhat of a joke.

00:09:08.278 --> 00:09:11.188
Doge was an early internet meme–a

00:09:11.388 --> 00:09:14.128
picture of a Japanese shiba inu dog

00:09:14.258 --> 00:09:16.558
with some text on it–and there was

00:09:16.568 --> 00:09:18.943
even a cryptocurrency called Dogecoin,

00:09:19.326 --> 00:09:21.989
which was the first “meme coin”.

00:09:22.783 --> 00:09:25.078
After Musk and Trump floated the

00:09:25.078 --> 00:09:27.498
idea of a “government efficiency

00:09:27.538 --> 00:09:30.478
commission,” a user on X suggested

00:09:30.478 --> 00:09:33.143
the acronym “DOGE,” and that was it.

00:09:33.568 --> 00:09:36.348
It might have seemed like a joke, a

00:09:36.518 --> 00:09:39.378
flippant idea created at a dinner party

00:09:39.388 --> 00:09:42.908
and hastily turned into reality, but there

00:09:42.908 --> 00:09:45.168
was a lot of planning that went into it.

00:09:46.838 --> 00:09:49.428
The first question was about how to

00:09:49.428 --> 00:09:52.288
structure this department, or commission.

00:09:53.368 --> 00:09:56.008
A government clearly isn’t like a company

00:09:56.008 --> 00:09:59.468
with a CEO, who can create and dismantle

00:09:59.488 --> 00:10:01.618
departments and positions at will.

00:10:02.128 --> 00:10:04.168
There are systems of checks and

00:10:04.178 --> 00:10:06.908
balances, laws in place to prevent

00:10:06.928 --> 00:10:09.198
a rogue actor from coming in and

00:10:09.198 --> 00:10:11.378
making sweeping changes that are not

00:10:11.418 --> 00:10:13.018
in the best interests of the country.

00:10:13.768 --> 00:10:17.948
So Musk and his team had to get creative.

00:10:19.138 --> 00:10:21.728
Instead of creating an entirely new

00:10:21.728 --> 00:10:23.748
department, which would have been

00:10:23.758 --> 00:10:26.498
fraught with legal and political issues,

00:10:27.048 --> 00:10:29.368
they took an existing department,

00:10:29.768 --> 00:10:33.660
renamed it and expanded its remit.

00:10:34.758 --> 00:10:37.058
The United States Digital Service,

00:10:37.118 --> 00:10:41.838
or USDS, was created in 2014 under

00:10:41.838 --> 00:10:45.428
Barack Obama, and was intended to, and

00:10:45.428 --> 00:10:48.058
I’m quoting directly, "deliver better

00:10:48.108 --> 00:10:50.228
government services to the American

00:10:50.228 --> 00:10:53.268
people through technology and design."

00:10:54.528 --> 00:10:56.828
The Executive Order signed by Trump

00:10:56.848 --> 00:10:59.728
on his first day in office renamed

00:10:59.728 --> 00:11:03.478
it as the United States DOGE Service,

00:11:03.788 --> 00:11:05.808
which conveniently meant it could

00:11:05.808 --> 00:11:09.431
still have the same initials: USDS.

00:11:10.638 --> 00:11:13.912
And within the renamed and reorganised

00:11:13.912 --> 00:11:17.648
USDS sat DOGE: the Department

00:11:17.778 --> 00:11:19.278
of Governmental Efficiency.

00:11:20.358 --> 00:11:23.158
Now, it still isn’t completely clear

00:11:23.428 --> 00:11:26.498
what the difference between the USDS

00:11:26.668 --> 00:11:29.748
and DOGE is, and there are several other

00:11:29.768 --> 00:11:33.805
agencies that sit under or alongside it.

00:11:34.148 --> 00:11:36.388
In the interests of simplicity, I’ll

00:11:36.388 --> 00:11:38.438
call them all DOGE going forward.

00:11:39.738 --> 00:11:42.538
And DOGE had big plans.

00:11:43.358 --> 00:11:46.838
In late October of 2024, shortly

00:11:46.848 --> 00:11:49.908
before the election, Elon Musk had

00:11:50.008 --> 00:11:52.348
claimed that he could cut the federal

00:11:52.348 --> 00:11:56.497
budget by at least $2 trillion,

00:11:56.497 --> 00:11:59.108
around one-third of its total.

00:12:00.508 --> 00:12:04.308
Importantly, $2 trillion is higher

00:12:04.678 --> 00:12:07.238
than the discretionary spending budget.

00:12:07.698 --> 00:12:10.566
Now, to explain why this is important,

00:12:11.101 --> 00:12:13.948
in the United States, federal government

00:12:13.948 --> 00:12:17.348
spending is split into three categories:

00:12:17.888 --> 00:12:20.438
mandatory spending, discretionary

00:12:20.438 --> 00:12:23.968
spending, and interest on government debt.

00:12:25.038 --> 00:12:28.138
Mandatory spending refers to the money

00:12:28.308 --> 00:12:30.288
that the government is obligated to

00:12:30.288 --> 00:12:33.148
spend on its citizens, including programs

00:12:33.328 --> 00:12:35.928
such as Social Security and Medicare.

00:12:36.918 --> 00:12:39.018
Interest on government debt is the

00:12:39.018 --> 00:12:40.918
interest the US government pays on

00:12:40.918 --> 00:12:43.668
its bonds, which it is obliged to pay

00:12:43.858 --> 00:12:46.008
to maintain faith in the US dollar.

00:12:46.868 --> 00:12:49.228
Discretionary spending is the only

00:12:49.228 --> 00:12:52.388
category that is “optional”, which can

00:12:52.388 --> 00:12:55.258
be increased or decreased by Congress.

00:12:56.138 --> 00:12:58.438
This includes things like defence,

00:12:58.758 --> 00:13:02.198
foreign aid, transportation and education.

00:13:03.448 --> 00:13:06.233
Mandatory spending is around 60% of

00:13:06.268 --> 00:13:08.158
the total, discretionary spending

00:13:08.158 --> 00:13:11.858
is 27%, and the remaining 13%

00:13:12.108 --> 00:13:13.858
is interest on government debt.

00:13:15.088 --> 00:13:19.676
Together, it makes up almost $7 trillion

00:13:19.948 --> 00:13:23.848
per year, and there was Musk claiming he

00:13:23.848 --> 00:13:26.728
could trim this to more like $5 trillion.

00:13:28.388 --> 00:13:30.408
Now, there were few people who would

00:13:30.408 --> 00:13:32.358
claim that the US government was

00:13:32.358 --> 00:13:35.338
this slick, well-oiled machine that

00:13:35.338 --> 00:13:37.008
was as efficient as it could be.

00:13:37.738 --> 00:13:39.478
Of course, there was waste, of

00:13:39.508 --> 00:13:40.818
course, there were people who

00:13:40.818 --> 00:13:42.468
weren’t working particularly hard.

00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:44.718
Perhaps there were some people

00:13:44.868 --> 00:13:46.668
who weren’t doing any work at all.

00:13:47.348 --> 00:13:49.288
We’re talking about millions of people,

00:13:49.368 --> 00:13:52.318
a vast bureaucracy, a government.

00:13:52.928 --> 00:13:55.148
A little waste was to be expected.

00:13:56.168 --> 00:14:00.218
But to say that 30% of government spending

00:14:00.228 --> 00:14:03.408
was wasteful, especially given that such

00:14:03.438 --> 00:14:05.378
a large amount of government spending

00:14:05.638 --> 00:14:08.168
is mandatory, with the money going to

00:14:08.168 --> 00:14:10.838
people the government is legally required

00:14:10.888 --> 00:14:14.108
to give it to, that seemed extreme.

00:14:15.468 --> 00:14:18.818
But Elon Musk, even to his greatest

00:14:18.848 --> 00:14:21.288
critics, had an established track

00:14:21.318 --> 00:14:23.678
record of pushing through change

00:14:23.938 --> 00:14:25.388
that was thought to be impossible,

00:14:25.908 --> 00:14:28.648
whether it was Twitter, mass-market

00:14:28.658 --> 00:14:31.278
electric cars or reusable rockets.

00:14:32.388 --> 00:14:36.358
And almost immediately, DOGE got to work.

00:14:37.358 --> 00:14:40.078
It was purposefully kept small, with

00:14:40.098 --> 00:14:43.718
teams of one team lead, one engineer,

00:14:44.098 --> 00:14:46.878
one HR specialist and one lawyer.

00:14:47.918 --> 00:14:51.198
These DOGE teams were placed within

00:14:51.258 --> 00:14:54.628
federal agencies, but instead of a

00:14:54.688 --> 00:14:57.358
traditional, consultant-led approach,

00:14:57.678 --> 00:14:59.898
the problem of increasing efficiency

00:15:00.158 --> 00:15:02.968
was attacked from a technical angle.

00:15:04.438 --> 00:15:07.248
Most often, DOGE employees were

00:15:07.248 --> 00:15:09.948
not previously federal workers, and

00:15:09.948 --> 00:15:12.528
instead were highly talented, and

00:15:12.708 --> 00:15:15.628
often very young, computer programmers.

00:15:16.748 --> 00:15:18.398
They were embedded within

00:15:18.418 --> 00:15:20.718
government agencies, given access

00:15:20.888 --> 00:15:22.598
to government computer systems,

00:15:22.938 --> 00:15:24.828
and allowed to get to work.

00:15:26.368 --> 00:15:30.168
The hypothesis was that by using AI and

00:15:30.208 --> 00:15:33.268
technical wizardry, DOGE would be able

00:15:33.268 --> 00:15:36.648
to identify wasteful spending in a way

00:15:36.648 --> 00:15:39.358
that previous federal systems would not.

00:15:40.508 --> 00:15:43.568
This huge fraud and waste that some

00:15:43.568 --> 00:15:45.528
people thought was going on within

00:15:45.528 --> 00:15:47.658
the US government would have nowhere

00:15:47.668 --> 00:15:49.678
to hide; it would be identified,

00:15:49.898 --> 00:15:52.448
stopped, and the savings passed

00:15:52.448 --> 00:15:54.578
back to the American taxpayer.

00:15:56.018 --> 00:15:58.168
However, almost immediately,

00:15:58.425 --> 00:15:59.758
the controversy started.

00:16:01.018 --> 00:16:03.368
At the start of February, reports

00:16:03.388 --> 00:16:06.328
emerged that DOGE had gained access

00:16:06.328 --> 00:16:08.208
to the Treasury Department’s payment

00:16:08.208 --> 00:16:10.478
system, which handles everything from

00:16:10.488 --> 00:16:13.478
Social Security checks to tax refunds.

00:16:14.658 --> 00:16:16.758
This raised alarm bells.

00:16:17.298 --> 00:16:19.518
Democratic lawmakers, like Senator

00:16:19.568 --> 00:16:21.758
Elizabeth Warren, warned that

00:16:21.768 --> 00:16:23.358
giving an unelected group like

00:16:23.378 --> 00:16:25.618
DOGE access to such sensitive

00:16:25.628 --> 00:16:28.738
information was a recipe for disaster.

00:16:29.838 --> 00:16:31.758
What if there were errors?

00:16:32.018 --> 00:16:34.778
What if the data was misused?

00:16:35.888 --> 00:16:38.178
After all, Musk’s companies,

00:16:38.318 --> 00:16:40.768
like SpaceX and Tesla, have

00:16:40.808 --> 00:16:43.348
billions in government contracts.

00:16:44.268 --> 00:16:47.208
Critics, including unions and consumer

00:16:47.268 --> 00:16:50.638
advocacy groups, cried foul, arguing that

00:16:50.638 --> 00:16:53.118
this was a massive conflict of interest.

00:16:54.348 --> 00:16:56.458
A lawsuit was filed on February

00:16:56.458 --> 00:16:58.418
3rd, alleging that DOGE’s

00:16:58.478 --> 00:17:00.088
access to the Treasury’s systems

00:17:00.378 --> 00:17:02.528
violated federal privacy laws.

00:17:03.908 --> 00:17:05.908
And then there were the layoffs.

00:17:06.668 --> 00:17:09.298
DOGE didn’t just want to modernise

00:17:09.318 --> 00:17:11.798
technology; it wanted to shrink

00:17:12.028 --> 00:17:14.198
the federal workforce dramatically.

00:17:15.718 --> 00:17:19.438
By April 2025, DOGE claimed to have

00:17:19.438 --> 00:17:23.628
saved $150 billion through a combination

00:17:23.638 --> 00:17:26.018
of contract cancellations, grant

00:17:26.058 --> 00:17:29.008
terminations, and workforce reductions.

00:17:30.018 --> 00:17:33.118
But these cuts came at a cost.

00:17:34.418 --> 00:17:36.418
For example, the Department of

00:17:36.428 --> 00:17:39.758
Health and Human Services saw 20,000

00:17:39.758 --> 00:17:42.478
positions slashed, including roles

00:17:42.678 --> 00:17:44.498
at the National Institutes of Health,

00:17:44.798 --> 00:17:47.198
which funds critical medical research.

00:17:48.622 --> 00:17:51.078
One analysis estimated that these

00:17:51.078 --> 00:17:53.708
cuts could lead to a $10 billion

00:17:53.708 --> 00:17:56.418
loss in economic activity and

00:17:56.693 --> 00:17:59.428
44,000 jobs across the country.

00:18:00.628 --> 00:18:03.528
After all, these were 44,000 people,

00:18:03.788 --> 00:18:06.538
enough to fit a football stadium, who

00:18:06.538 --> 00:18:09.128
were now out of work, might now depend

00:18:09.138 --> 00:18:11.018
on the government for assistance,

00:18:11.278 --> 00:18:13.628
and be radically cutting down their

00:18:13.678 --> 00:18:15.808
own discretionary spending on all

00:18:15.808 --> 00:18:17.388
the sort of stuff that keeps the

00:18:17.388 --> 00:18:19.398
American economy driving forward.

00:18:20.841 --> 00:18:23.201
The United States Agency for

00:18:23.231 --> 00:18:25.861
International Development, or USAID,

00:18:26.071 --> 00:18:28.641
was hit even harder, with most of its

00:18:28.661 --> 00:18:31.561
programmes gutted, disbanded completely.

00:18:33.291 --> 00:18:35.021
Critics pointed out that these

00:18:35.021 --> 00:18:37.081
cuts weren’t just about trimming

00:18:37.091 --> 00:18:38.811
fat; they were dismantling

00:18:38.811 --> 00:18:40.981
programs that supported vulnerable

00:18:40.981 --> 00:18:44.181
populations, both at home and abroad.

00:18:45.501 --> 00:18:49.111
By May of 2025, some estimates

00:18:49.331 --> 00:18:51.951
linked DOGE’s foreign aid cuts to

00:18:51.951 --> 00:18:55.871
300,000 deaths, mostly children.

00:18:56.971 --> 00:18:59.131
To this, the reaction of Musk and

00:18:59.131 --> 00:19:01.741
Trump can be summed up as “well,

00:19:02.031 --> 00:19:03.621
it shouldn’t be up to the American

00:19:03.671 --> 00:19:05.931
taxpayer to pay for all this stuff.”

00:19:06.901 --> 00:19:09.531
Like it or not, Trump won the election

00:19:09.791 --> 00:19:12.921
on an America-first mandate, and this

00:19:12.921 --> 00:19:15.341
was nothing if not America first.

00:19:16.624 --> 00:19:18.955
And alongside this, there were plenty

00:19:18.955 --> 00:19:20.675
of examples of federal government

00:19:20.675 --> 00:19:23.445
spending that raised a few eyebrows,

00:19:23.815 --> 00:19:25.955
even to Trump’s greatest critics.

00:19:26.865 --> 00:19:29.775
Funding for a transgender medical

00:19:29.775 --> 00:19:32.915
clinic in India, $20 million to

00:19:32.915 --> 00:19:35.505
create a Sesame Street show in Iraq,

00:19:35.905 --> 00:19:38.375
or even the discovery that the US

00:19:38.425 --> 00:19:42.480
Air Force had been charged $1,300

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:45.315
per reheatable coffee cup by Boeing.

00:19:47.015 --> 00:19:49.625
DOGE’s website proudly displayed a

00:19:49.835 --> 00:19:52.495
“Wall of Receipts,” listing thousands

00:19:52.495 --> 00:19:54.695
of terminated contracts and grants,

00:19:55.045 --> 00:19:57.065
with savings they claimed reached

00:19:57.065 --> 00:20:02.185
$205 billion by August 2025, a

00:20:02.185 --> 00:20:09.015
savings of $1,273.29 per taxpayer.

00:20:10.575 --> 00:20:13.635
To many Americans, this was refreshing,

00:20:14.055 --> 00:20:16.295
a government finally taking a hard look

00:20:16.555 --> 00:20:18.245
at where their tax dollars were going,

00:20:18.805 --> 00:20:21.935
and, most importantly, acting to fix it.

00:20:22.925 --> 00:20:26.515
Indeed, a March 2025 NBC poll

00:20:26.875 --> 00:20:29.835
found that 46% of voters thought

00:20:29.835 --> 00:20:32.255
DOGE was a good idea in principle.

00:20:33.475 --> 00:20:35.845
But the critics weren’t having it.

00:20:36.535 --> 00:20:38.755
They argued that DOGE’s savings

00:20:38.785 --> 00:20:40.765
were wildly exaggerated.

00:20:41.765 --> 00:20:44.715
Firstly, the $2 trillion figure that

00:20:44.715 --> 00:20:46.745
was floated in the days before the

00:20:46.745 --> 00:20:49.465
election was reduced to $1 trillion

00:20:49.755 --> 00:20:51.695
shortly after DOGE was established,

00:20:51.865 --> 00:20:54.815
then to $150 billion by April

00:20:54.875 --> 00:20:58.945
2025, a reduction of more than 90%.

00:21:00.025 --> 00:21:02.255
And there were claims that it would

00:21:02.265 --> 00:21:04.795
actually have a negative effect; there

00:21:04.795 --> 00:21:07.115
wouldn’t just be no savings, it would

00:21:07.135 --> 00:21:09.295
end up costing the country money.

00:21:10.485 --> 00:21:13.265
Independent analyses, like one from

00:21:13.265 --> 00:21:15.695
the Internal Revenue Service, warned

00:21:15.825 --> 00:21:18.285
that DOGE’s cuts to tax enforcement

00:21:18.555 --> 00:21:21.505
could actually increase the federal

00:21:21.505 --> 00:21:24.445
deficit by hundreds of billions, as the

00:21:24.465 --> 00:21:26.755
IRS would struggle to collect revenue.

00:21:27.855 --> 00:21:30.465
In other words, these cost “savings”

00:21:30.735 --> 00:21:32.755
would be more than offset by

00:21:32.775 --> 00:21:35.255
losses in tax revenue, meaning

00:21:35.435 --> 00:21:38.225
the country lost, not saved money.

00:21:39.465 --> 00:21:42.285
And then there were the accounting errors

00:21:42.445 --> 00:21:45.305
and “creative” savings calculations.

00:21:45.995 --> 00:21:48.145
Journalists uncovered billions of

00:21:48.145 --> 00:21:50.805
dollars in miscounting, with some

00:21:50.875 --> 00:21:53.085
“savings” tied to contracts that had

00:21:53.115 --> 00:21:55.805
already been cancelled before DOGE even

00:21:55.805 --> 00:21:58.645
existed, and other “savings” accounting

00:21:58.645 --> 00:22:01.045
for the absolute maximum that could

00:22:01.045 --> 00:22:03.835
possibly be spent, and the real number

00:22:04.015 --> 00:22:06.085
almost always coming in much lower.

00:22:07.875 --> 00:22:09.485
And then there was what we can

00:22:09.485 --> 00:22:12.145
characterise as “The Musk Factor”.

00:22:13.375 --> 00:22:15.555
If DOGE was controversial,

00:22:15.845 --> 00:22:18.125
its leader was even more so.

00:22:19.355 --> 00:22:22.055
Elon Musk, the billionaire behind

00:22:22.095 --> 00:22:25.695
Tesla, SpaceX, and X, was the face of

00:22:25.695 --> 00:22:28.795
DOGE, even if he was officially just a

00:22:28.965 --> 00:22:31.535
“special government employee”, technically

00:22:31.785 --> 00:22:34.385
only allowed to work 130 days a year.

00:22:35.815 --> 00:22:38.705
His involvement was a double-edged sword.

00:22:39.705 --> 00:22:42.695
On one hand, his reputation as a

00:22:42.765 --> 00:22:45.925
disruptor gave DOGE credibility among

00:22:45.925 --> 00:22:48.005
those who wanted radical change.

00:22:48.415 --> 00:22:51.025
He wasn’t a career politician; he

00:22:51.035 --> 00:22:53.515
was a modern-day Thomas Edison —a

00:22:53.575 --> 00:22:55.795
tech genius and entrepreneur who

00:22:55.795 --> 00:22:57.855
had run wildly successful companies.

00:22:58.125 --> 00:22:59.565
If anyone was up to the

00:22:59.565 --> 00:23:01.035
challenge, it was him.

00:23:02.394 --> 00:23:04.624
On the other hand, Musk’s involvement

00:23:04.754 --> 00:23:07.694
raised red flags, tainting the project.

00:23:08.634 --> 00:23:11.214
His businesses rely heavily on

00:23:11.224 --> 00:23:13.614
government contracts; SpaceX alone

00:23:13.804 --> 00:23:16.074
has deals worth billions with NASA

00:23:16.344 --> 00:23:17.894
and the Department of Defence.

00:23:18.834 --> 00:23:21.604
Critics pointed out that Musk’s access

00:23:21.604 --> 00:23:24.054
to federal systems could benefit his

00:23:24.054 --> 00:23:26.334
companies while harming competitors.

00:23:27.024 --> 00:23:29.434
He was, after all, being given

00:23:29.618 --> 00:23:32.214
unfettered access to government systems,

00:23:32.574 --> 00:23:34.224
something that was perhaps worth

00:23:34.234 --> 00:23:37.384
hundreds of billions to his companies.

00:23:39.024 --> 00:23:42.864
By April 2025, just a few months

00:23:43.024 --> 00:23:45.184
after DOGE was established, the

00:23:45.184 --> 00:23:46.854
cracks were starting to show.

00:23:47.544 --> 00:23:49.794
Protests erupted across the country,

00:23:50.074 --> 00:23:52.234
with chants of “Elon Musk has to

00:23:52.234 --> 00:23:54.824
go” heard outside Tesla showrooms.

00:23:55.764 --> 00:23:57.634
In Manhattan, demonstrators

00:23:57.644 --> 00:24:00.164
waved signs reading “No Trump,

00:24:00.304 --> 00:24:02.774
No Musk, No Fascist USA.”

00:24:03.554 --> 00:24:05.184
There were organised boycotts of

00:24:05.184 --> 00:24:07.564
Tesla, Musk’s electric car company.

00:24:08.094 --> 00:24:10.864
Sales dropped dramatically, most

00:24:10.874 --> 00:24:13.004
prominently in Europe but also

00:24:13.024 --> 00:24:15.524
in the US, and this was followed

00:24:15.544 --> 00:24:17.814
by a crash in the share price.

00:24:18.684 --> 00:24:21.754
Musk was forced to intervene, and

00:24:21.984 --> 00:24:23.844
in April, he announced that he would

00:24:23.854 --> 00:24:26.484
be leaving DOGE to focus on Tesla.

00:24:27.684 --> 00:24:28.994
By the start of May,

00:24:29.314 --> 00:24:30.644
he was officially gone.

00:24:31.774 --> 00:24:35.004
Now, although its creator, and the man

00:24:35.014 --> 00:24:37.554
most associated with it, is no longer

00:24:37.614 --> 00:24:41.094
involved, DOGE is still active, and its

00:24:41.124 --> 00:24:45.214
official mandate runs until July 2026.

00:24:46.134 --> 00:24:48.614
So, what does the future hold for DOGE?

00:24:49.744 --> 00:24:53.434
As of September 2025, although it is not

00:24:53.434 --> 00:24:55.364
in the news as much as earlier in the

00:24:55.364 --> 00:24:57.834
year, it’s still an important question.

00:24:59.234 --> 00:25:01.724
President Trump could extend DOGE’s

00:25:01.754 --> 00:25:03.904
mandate with another executive

00:25:03.904 --> 00:25:06.594
order, and there’s talk of states

00:25:06.594 --> 00:25:08.874
like Oklahoma and Texas launching

00:25:08.874 --> 00:25:11.514
their own DOGE-inspired initiatives.

00:25:12.144 --> 00:25:14.114
Even some European leaders have

00:25:14.114 --> 00:25:16.524
expressed curiosity about the concept,

00:25:16.844 --> 00:25:18.814
wondering if a similar approach

00:25:18.864 --> 00:25:20.394
could work across the Atlantic.

00:25:21.484 --> 00:25:24.704
But the road ahead is far from smooth.

00:25:25.324 --> 00:25:26.704
The organisation is still

00:25:26.704 --> 00:25:28.684
plagued by legal battles.

00:25:29.244 --> 00:25:30.694
And as for public

00:25:30.694 --> 00:25:32.834
opinion, it remains split.

00:25:33.974 --> 00:25:36.784
Younger Americans especially disapprove

00:25:36.824 --> 00:25:39.764
of DOGE, and older, especially

00:25:39.774 --> 00:25:42.384
Republican-leaning voters, support it.

00:25:43.364 --> 00:25:46.364
For its supporters, DOGE is a bold

00:25:46.394 --> 00:25:48.394
experiment in making government

00:25:48.404 --> 00:25:51.184
leaner and more accountable, a chance

00:25:51.394 --> 00:25:53.464
to finally tackle the bureaucracy

00:25:53.694 --> 00:25:55.484
that’s been slowing America down.

00:25:56.704 --> 00:25:59.694
For its critics, it is a reckless power

00:25:59.694 --> 00:26:02.694
grab, one that risks dismantling vital

00:26:02.694 --> 00:26:05.484
services, eroding public trust, and

00:26:05.494 --> 00:26:07.674
furthermore, one that looks like it will

00:26:07.684 --> 00:26:10.624
even cost, not save, the country money.

00:26:11.724 --> 00:26:14.574
Whether it is a stroke of genius or

00:26:14.574 --> 00:26:17.154
a spectacular misstep, one thing is

00:26:17.154 --> 00:26:20.214
certain: DOGE has sparked a conversation

00:26:20.444 --> 00:26:22.904
about what government should be, who it

00:26:22.904 --> 00:26:25.274
should serve, and how it should be run.

00:26:26.104 --> 00:26:28.874
And that conversation, love it or loathe

00:26:28.874 --> 00:26:31.594
it, isn’t going away anytime soon.

00:26:33.404 --> 00:26:35.304
OK, then, that is it for

00:26:35.304 --> 00:26:37.334
today's episode on DOGE.

00:26:37.604 --> 00:26:38.944
I hope it's been an interesting one

00:26:39.224 --> 00:26:40.894
and that you've learnt something new.

00:26:41.794 --> 00:26:43.334
As always, I would love to know

00:26:43.334 --> 00:26:44.994
what you thought of this episode.

00:26:45.384 --> 00:26:46.744
What do you think of DOGE?

00:26:47.084 --> 00:26:48.824
Do you think it’s a fantastic idea

00:26:49.034 --> 00:26:50.544
and that every country should follow

00:26:50.544 --> 00:26:52.914
its example, that it was a terrible,

00:26:53.094 --> 00:26:55.944
politicised plot, or somewhere in between?

00:26:56.284 --> 00:26:58.124
