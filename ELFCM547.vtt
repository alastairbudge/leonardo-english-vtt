Hello, hello, hello, and welcome

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.890
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:12.530
Minds, by Leonardo English, the show

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.259
where you can listen to fascinating

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.639
stories and learn weird and wonderful

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.710
things about the world at the same

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.740
time as improving your English.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.610
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is part

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.540
three of our three-part mini-series on

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.353
unusual characters from World War I.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.019
In case you missed them, part one

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.180
was on Lawrence of Arabia, the

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.390
British archaeologist and military

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.729
officer who fought alongside nomadic

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.965
tribes in the Arabian desert.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.309
Part two was on Mata Hari, the Dutch

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.839
exotic dancer and courtesan who was

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.360
tried and shot on charges of being a spy.

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.100
And in today’s episode, part

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.330
three, we are going to talk about

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.669
Manfred von Richthofen, the man

00:00:57.889 --> 00:01:00.339
better known as The Red Baron.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.360
He is perhaps the best-known fighter

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.360
pilot in the world, with 80 confirmed

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.030
planes shot down, and his story is

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.140
one of chivalry, strategy, bravery,

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.009
propaganda, and the bloody reality

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.789
behind the supposed glories of war.

00:01:19.449 --> 00:01:21.940
It’s also an interesting story from

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.750
the point of view of understanding

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.790
the evolving military role of the

00:01:25.808 --> 00:01:28.419
aeroplane, so let’s not waste a

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:31.030
minute, and get right into it.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.899
When war broke out in Europe on

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.770
the 28th of July 1914, Manfred

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.750
von Richthofen was 22 years old.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.650
He had already spent a couple of

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.159
years training as a cavalry officer,

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:49.630
a soldier who sits on top of a

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.070
horse and charges at the enemy.

00:01:52.822 --> 00:01:55.822
For this young man, joining the cavalry

00:01:56.172 --> 00:01:58.302
was something of an inevitability.

00:01:59.112 --> 00:02:01.252
He came from an aristocratic

00:02:01.302 --> 00:02:02.312
Prussian family.

00:02:02.692 --> 00:02:04.022
His father was in the

00:02:04.022 --> 00:02:05.822
cavalry, as was his uncle.

00:02:06.432 --> 00:02:09.452
Generations of von Richthofens had

00:02:09.452 --> 00:02:11.942
served the Prussian king as cavalry

00:02:11.962 --> 00:02:15.772
officers, so naturally, Manfred and his

00:02:15.772 --> 00:02:18.382
brothers followed in their footsteps.

00:02:19.372 --> 00:02:21.472
The problem was that it soon

00:02:21.482 --> 00:02:24.612
became clear that cavalry was not

00:02:24.662 --> 00:02:26.922
very useful in modern warfare.

00:02:27.902 --> 00:02:30.622
Up against machine guns, and charging

00:02:30.622 --> 00:02:34.382
through muddy fields, men riding on horses

00:02:34.682 --> 00:02:37.722
are about as useful as a chocolate teapot.

00:02:39.222 --> 00:02:42.552
Soon enough, both on the Allied and

00:02:42.552 --> 00:02:45.182
the German side, cavalry regiments

00:02:45.418 --> 00:02:48.882
were disbanded or reassigned, the men

00:02:49.122 --> 00:02:51.262
who would previously charge valiantly

00:02:51.262 --> 00:02:53.552
towards the enemy on horseback now

00:02:53.562 --> 00:02:56.592
relegated to less glorious positions.

00:02:58.022 --> 00:03:00.322
In the case of Manfred von

00:03:00.322 --> 00:03:03.382
Richthofen, he was sent to work far

00:03:03.452 --> 00:03:05.752
behind the front line, working on

00:03:05.782 --> 00:03:08.562
communications and supply operations.

00:03:09.562 --> 00:03:12.372
For a young man eager to serve his

00:03:12.372 --> 00:03:15.672
country, and who felt like this chance had

00:03:15.672 --> 00:03:18.782
been snatched from him, he was desperate

00:03:18.972 --> 00:03:21.592
to find a way to get closer to the action.

00:03:22.551 --> 00:03:24.741
The answer seemed to be

00:03:24.931 --> 00:03:26.521
in the skies above him.

00:03:27.451 --> 00:03:29.013
He had seen aeroplanes taking

00:03:29.128 --> 00:03:31.158
off from far behind the front

00:03:31.158 --> 00:03:33.178
line, sent on reconnaissance

00:03:33.178 --> 00:03:35.208
missions to observe the enemy.

00:03:35.998 --> 00:03:37.898
This was what he wanted

00:03:37.898 --> 00:03:39.228
to be doing, he thought.

00:03:39.798 --> 00:03:41.768
It was a chance to do something more

00:03:41.768 --> 00:03:44.738
useful, and he wrote a letter to his

00:03:44.738 --> 00:03:47.298
superior officer requesting a transfer.

00:03:48.978 --> 00:03:52.278
It said, so the legend goes, "I have not

00:03:52.288 --> 00:03:54.648
gone to war in order to collect cheese

00:03:54.648 --> 00:03:57.568
and eggs, but for another purpose."

00:03:58.968 --> 00:04:01.838
The request was granted, and in

00:04:01.838 --> 00:04:04.828
May of 1915, he was transferred

00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:07.008
to the German air service.

00:04:08.108 --> 00:04:10.808
Now, the Wright Brothers had invented

00:04:10.808 --> 00:04:14.898
the first aeroplane in 1903, and both

00:04:15.128 --> 00:04:18.608
the German and the Allied armies used

00:04:18.608 --> 00:04:21.508
aeroplanes, primarily for reconnaissance,

00:04:21.708 --> 00:04:24.758
to fly up in the sky and observe the

00:04:24.758 --> 00:04:27.478
positions and movements of the enemy.

00:04:28.918 --> 00:04:30.888
To state the obvious, planes are

00:04:30.888 --> 00:04:32.568
a very effective way of doing

00:04:32.568 --> 00:04:35.238
this, and at least for the first

00:04:35.278 --> 00:04:37.508
couple of years of the war, these

00:04:37.538 --> 00:04:40.428
reconnaissance missions were fairly safe.

00:04:41.338 --> 00:04:43.648
If the planes flew high enough,

00:04:43.898 --> 00:04:45.301
they would be out of range

00:04:45.318 --> 00:04:46.878
of gunfire from the ground.

00:04:47.638 --> 00:04:49.848
And they didn’t need to worry too

00:04:49.848 --> 00:04:52.538
much about enemy planes because

00:04:52.848 --> 00:04:54.138
they weren’t much of a threat.

00:04:55.328 --> 00:04:58.448
These planes were relatively basic;

00:04:58.828 --> 00:05:00.988
just one pilot in the front and

00:05:01.008 --> 00:05:02.978
another man in the back who was

00:05:02.978 --> 00:05:05.278
responsible for taking photographs.

00:05:06.218 --> 00:05:09.328
The pilot and his wingman would normally

00:05:09.358 --> 00:05:12.328
carry a weapon, a pistol or a rifle.

00:05:12.928 --> 00:05:15.238
They might shoot at an enemy aircraft

00:05:15.258 --> 00:05:17.638
if they got too close, and some

00:05:17.658 --> 00:05:20.658
planes had guns mounted to the side.

00:05:21.258 --> 00:05:23.978
But it was rare for a plane to be

00:05:23.978 --> 00:05:26.218
shot down by another plane because

00:05:26.218 --> 00:05:27.868
it was so difficult to do so.

00:05:29.088 --> 00:05:32.228
These planes had open cockpits, they would

00:05:32.238 --> 00:05:35.448
be flying at 150 kilometres per hour,

00:05:35.818 --> 00:05:38.368
often in difficult weather conditions.

00:05:39.458 --> 00:05:41.538
In the early days of the war, the

00:05:41.538 --> 00:05:44.128
air was a relatively safe place,

00:05:44.528 --> 00:05:46.558
and there were even reports of

00:05:46.678 --> 00:05:49.018
enemy pilots waving at each other

00:05:49.028 --> 00:05:51.668
in the air, a show of solidarity.

00:05:52.728 --> 00:05:54.998
This was the state of the war

00:05:54.998 --> 00:05:57.163
of the air when von Richthofen

00:05:57.248 --> 00:05:58.508
joined the air service.

00:05:59.708 --> 00:06:02.528
And when he joined, he was not the one

00:06:02.568 --> 00:06:05.208
piloting the plane, he was not the driver.

00:06:05.868 --> 00:06:08.408
He came from an aristocratic family,

00:06:08.718 --> 00:06:11.078
he was used to having chauffeurs who

00:06:11.078 --> 00:06:13.828
would drive him around, so it seemed

00:06:13.838 --> 00:06:15.838
natural that the piloting of the

00:06:15.838 --> 00:06:18.838
aircraft would be done by someone of a

00:06:18.998 --> 00:06:22.828
suitable, lower social class, and the

00:06:22.858 --> 00:06:25.148
supposedly more skillful navigation

00:06:25.148 --> 00:06:27.942
work would be done by von Richthofen.

00:06:28.596 --> 00:06:30.647
After a few weeks of training, he

00:06:30.647 --> 00:06:32.767
was ready for his first flight.

00:06:33.687 --> 00:06:35.497
For several months, he worked

00:06:35.517 --> 00:06:37.907
on reconnaissance, and he even

00:06:37.907 --> 00:06:40.237
saw some action, shooting down a

00:06:40.257 --> 00:06:42.247
French plane with his machine gun.

00:06:43.257 --> 00:06:46.237
Now, he wasn’t credited with this kill,

00:06:46.257 --> 00:06:48.897
or “victory” as it’s technically called.

00:06:49.917 --> 00:06:52.367
This was because the French plane came

00:06:52.367 --> 00:06:55.607
down behind French lines, and therefore

00:06:55.847 --> 00:06:58.927
couldn’t be confirmed, but it seems that

00:06:58.947 --> 00:07:01.352
this was the first time von Richthofen

00:07:01.352 --> 00:07:03.687
successfully downed an enemy fighter.

00:07:04.597 --> 00:07:06.527
It was also an important

00:07:06.567 --> 00:07:08.037
realisation for him.

00:07:08.757 --> 00:07:10.477
He was the reconnaissance

00:07:10.497 --> 00:07:13.047
officer, sitting behind the pilot.

00:07:14.357 --> 00:07:17.157
To successfully shoot down an enemy plane,

00:07:17.757 --> 00:07:19.657
he would have to practically pull up

00:07:19.677 --> 00:07:22.757
alongside it and, therefore, put himself

00:07:22.797 --> 00:07:25.847
in grave danger, or at least, give himself

00:07:25.907 --> 00:07:28.917
no positional advantage over his target.

00:07:30.117 --> 00:07:32.697
Plus, having one person pulling the

00:07:32.697 --> 00:07:35.157
trigger and another piloting the

00:07:35.157 --> 00:07:38.010
aeroplane was kind of inefficient.

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:40.760
Split-second decisions needed

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.148
to be made, and it would be far

00:07:43.148 --> 00:07:45.518
more efficient if the pilot was

00:07:45.548 --> 00:07:47.168
also the one pulling the trigger.

00:07:48.468 --> 00:07:50.968
And if there was a way for the machine

00:07:50.968 --> 00:07:53.708
gun to be pointing forward, not out

00:07:53.708 --> 00:07:56.258
from the side, this would give the

00:07:56.278 --> 00:07:58.948
attacking aeroplane a great advantage.

00:07:59.478 --> 00:08:01.168
You could point your aeroplane at your

00:08:01.168 --> 00:08:04.265
target and fire rather than point your

00:08:04.285 --> 00:08:06.605
aeroplane in one direction but have

00:08:06.755 --> 00:08:08.965
your gun pointing in a different one.

00:08:10.025 --> 00:08:12.645
Now, on both the German and the

00:08:12.665 --> 00:08:15.005
Allied side, this was a problem

00:08:15.185 --> 00:08:18.045
that engineers were rushing to fix.

00:08:19.065 --> 00:08:21.455
The problem was that the propellers of

00:08:21.455 --> 00:08:23.645
the aircraft were at the front of the

00:08:23.645 --> 00:08:26.555
plane, and if you put a machine gun

00:08:26.865 --> 00:08:29.915
behind the propeller, well the bullets

00:08:30.185 --> 00:08:32.465
would hit the propeller and you’d damage

00:08:32.465 --> 00:08:35.075
your own aircraft, perhaps irreparably.

00:08:35.905 --> 00:08:38.095
There needed to be some way of

00:08:38.095 --> 00:08:40.575
synchronising the spinning of the

00:08:40.595 --> 00:08:42.965
propeller with the firing of the gun.

00:08:43.995 --> 00:08:46.285
But this was very complicated.

00:08:46.655 --> 00:08:49.705
Propellers spin very fast and at

00:08:49.745 --> 00:08:52.775
irregular speeds, and machine guns

00:08:52.915 --> 00:08:54.895
were not yet precise enough to

00:08:54.895 --> 00:08:57.348
fire at exactly the right moment.

00:08:58.405 --> 00:09:01.645
Fortunately, for the Germans at least, by

00:09:01.665 --> 00:09:05.895
mid-1915, such a technique was invented.

00:09:06.545 --> 00:09:08.935
A Dutch engineer called Anthony Fokker,

00:09:09.226 --> 00:09:10.805
who was working for the Germans,

00:09:11.135 --> 00:09:14.065
refined an existing French system that

00:09:14.065 --> 00:09:16.825
allowed a pilot to fire a machine gun

00:09:17.075 --> 00:09:19.915
forward without hitting the propeller.

00:09:20.795 --> 00:09:22.715
It was such an important discovery

00:09:23.015 --> 00:09:25.945
that German pilots were told not to fly

00:09:25.965 --> 00:09:28.315
over enemy territory, lest they were

00:09:28.315 --> 00:09:30.675
shot down and the secret discovered.

00:09:31.515 --> 00:09:35.075
But the Allies were almost there too, and

00:09:35.255 --> 00:09:39.005
by early 1916, British and French planes

00:09:39.045 --> 00:09:42.025
were also capable of firing forwards.

00:09:43.055 --> 00:09:46.050
Now, while this was all happening, von

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:48.805
Richthofen had a chance meeting that

00:09:48.805 --> 00:09:50.685
would change the course of his life.

00:09:51.735 --> 00:09:54.585
On a railway carriage, he noticed an

00:09:54.625 --> 00:09:57.356
otherwise unremarkable young man, but

00:09:57.823 --> 00:10:00.965
recognised him as Oswald Boelcke, an

00:10:00.995 --> 00:10:03.775
aircraft officer whose legendary stories

00:10:03.795 --> 00:10:06.025
of shooting down French and British planes

00:10:06.325 --> 00:10:08.545
had been published in German newspapers.

00:10:09.575 --> 00:10:11.805
Von Richthofen engaged him in

00:10:11.805 --> 00:10:14.185
conversation, which only strengthened

00:10:14.185 --> 00:10:16.335
his resolve to move from the

00:10:16.365 --> 00:10:18.325
back seat to the pilot seat.

00:10:19.465 --> 00:10:22.135
In October of 1915, he

00:10:22.135 --> 00:10:23.815
started training as a pilot.

00:10:24.716 --> 00:10:27.787
And despite the legendary career that

00:10:27.787 --> 00:10:30.497
he would go on to have, by all accounts,

00:10:30.727 --> 00:10:33.137
he was not a naturally talented pilot.

00:10:34.447 --> 00:10:36.467
To some pilots, holding the

00:10:36.467 --> 00:10:38.337
joystick, manoeuvring the plane,

00:10:38.677 --> 00:10:41.947
this came almost naturally, and they

00:10:41.947 --> 00:10:44.477
soon felt at one with the plane.

00:10:45.417 --> 00:10:46.787
Not von Richthofen.

00:10:47.161 --> 00:10:49.389
He even crashed his plane the first

00:10:49.399 --> 00:10:51.149
time he was given full control.

00:10:52.369 --> 00:10:55.389
Fortunately, he was a quick learner.

00:10:56.509 --> 00:10:59.399
He shot down his first enemy plane in

00:10:59.459 --> 00:11:01.899
April the following year, but again

00:11:02.219 --> 00:11:04.149
this was an “unofficial” victory.

00:11:05.049 --> 00:11:07.279
Like the one he did from the back seat

00:11:07.489 --> 00:11:10.972
in 1915, the plane came down in French

00:11:10.972 --> 00:11:13.542
territory, so it couldn’t be confirmed.

00:11:14.212 --> 00:11:16.582
For a victory to be confirmed, there

00:11:16.582 --> 00:11:19.002
had to be real, physical evidence,

00:11:19.132 --> 00:11:20.652
not just the word of the pilot.

00:11:21.522 --> 00:11:23.662
This will be important when it comes to

00:11:23.662 --> 00:11:26.092
some of von Richthofen’s actions later on.

00:11:27.582 --> 00:11:30.292
He met Oswald Boelcke again later in

00:11:30.292 --> 00:11:34.902
1916, and by this time, Boelcke had become

00:11:34.912 --> 00:11:37.922
something of a German propaganda icon.

00:11:38.862 --> 00:11:41.442
He had 18 confirmed victories

00:11:41.502 --> 00:11:43.372
under his belt, he had become the

00:11:43.372 --> 00:11:45.832
youngest captain in German military

00:11:45.832 --> 00:11:48.552
history, and was the most successful

00:11:48.602 --> 00:11:50.872
aircraft officer in the German army.

00:11:51.502 --> 00:11:53.619
He was all over the newspapers and

00:11:53.619 --> 00:11:56.579
received a constant influx of fan mail.

00:11:56.831 --> 00:11:59.771
He had outlined and written up guidelines

00:11:59.771 --> 00:12:02.621
and rules for successful aircraft combat

00:12:02.661 --> 00:12:05.241
operations, essentially writing the

00:12:05.241 --> 00:12:08.061
playbook for how to win in the air.

00:12:09.131 --> 00:12:12.071
And he had been tasked with setting

00:12:12.091 --> 00:12:15.261
up a new, elite, flying squadron.

00:12:16.531 --> 00:12:19.041
Von Richthofen was chosen to be one

00:12:19.061 --> 00:12:22.481
of this elite group of 8 ace pilots.

00:12:23.181 --> 00:12:25.091
An “ace”, by the way, is the

00:12:25.091 --> 00:12:27.211
term given to a pilot once they

00:12:27.221 --> 00:12:29.486
shoot down five enemy aeroplanes.

00:12:30.481 --> 00:12:34.061
And this squadron proved to be deadly.

00:12:34.791 --> 00:12:37.451
In its first month in the skies, Boelcke

00:12:37.471 --> 00:12:40.541
alone shot down 10 British planes.

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:43.741
Von Richthofen got his first confirmed

00:12:43.741 --> 00:12:47.216
victory on the 17th of September 1916.

00:12:48.238 --> 00:12:50.201
And this was just the start.

00:12:50.631 --> 00:12:53.031
The squadron would go on to be one of

00:12:53.031 --> 00:12:55.331
the most successful German aircraft

00:12:55.341 --> 00:12:59.604
squadrons in history, with 336 victories

00:12:59.944 --> 00:13:04.204
and only 44 casualties, of whom 31

00:13:04.204 --> 00:13:07.254
were killed, nine were wounded, two

00:13:07.444 --> 00:13:09.804
were taken as prisoners of war, and

00:13:10.064 --> 00:13:12.434
another two were killed in accidents.

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:15.410
One of those killed in accidents

00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:18.100
was the ace leader of the squadron,

00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:20.710
Oswald Boelcke, who died in

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:22.490
an accidental collision with

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:24.090
another plane from his squadron.

00:13:25.181 --> 00:13:27.030
At the time of his death, in

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:30.940
October of 1916, he had 40 confirmed

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:33.690
victories, to von Richthofen’s four.

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:37.370
Boelcke was only a year older

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:40.190
than von Richthofen, but he was

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:42.630
something of a hero and mentor.

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:45.750
He had literally written the guidebook

00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:48.080
on how to be a fighter pilot, and

00:13:48.272 --> 00:13:50.874
was by far and away the most deadly

00:13:50.904 --> 00:13:52.934
officer in the German airforce.

00:13:54.084 --> 00:13:56.704
It seemed like von Richtofen was

00:13:56.704 --> 00:13:59.664
determined to live up to his memory.

00:14:00.914 --> 00:14:03.694
And his kills, or “victories”,

00:14:03.964 --> 00:14:05.414
started to creep up.

00:14:06.164 --> 00:14:09.794
In January of 1917, he announced his

00:14:09.804 --> 00:14:12.964
16th confirmed kill, for which he was

00:14:12.964 --> 00:14:15.424
awarded the prestigious Pour le Mérite

00:14:15.514 --> 00:14:18.534
medal, otherwise known as the “Blue Max”.

00:14:20.204 --> 00:14:22.704
As a result, von Richthofen was

00:14:22.714 --> 00:14:25.114
given command of his own squadron.

00:14:26.054 --> 00:14:28.354
He was fast becoming a deadly

00:14:28.364 --> 00:14:31.194
fighter pilot, but he had also become

00:14:31.194 --> 00:14:34.003
known for his chivalry and honour.

00:14:34.874 --> 00:14:37.304
He would have a silver cup made every

00:14:37.304 --> 00:14:40.644
time he had a confirmed kill, and he would

00:14:40.794 --> 00:14:43.684
honour his fallen enemy by writing their

00:14:43.684 --> 00:14:46.354
name and the details of their aircraft.

00:14:47.244 --> 00:14:49.749
If he shot and damaged an aeroplane,

00:14:50.094 --> 00:14:51.634
and it was heading towards

00:14:51.634 --> 00:14:53.354
the ground, he wouldn’t follow

00:14:53.354 --> 00:14:55.194
it and try to kill the pilot.

00:14:55.754 --> 00:14:57.854
He knew they would be taken prisoner

00:14:57.984 --> 00:14:59.844
by the German forces on the ground.

00:15:00.524 --> 00:15:03.084
And when that happened, he was even

00:15:03.084 --> 00:15:05.514
known for going and shaking his enemy’s

00:15:05.514 --> 00:15:08.424
hand, and offering to dine with them

00:15:08.434 --> 00:15:10.294
that evening before they would be

00:15:10.304 --> 00:15:12.494
sent off to a prisoner of war camp.

00:15:13.554 --> 00:15:15.274
As he put it, he was a

00:15:15.294 --> 00:15:17.324
sportsman, not a butcher.

00:15:18.524 --> 00:15:21.634
And if you are wondering quite how

00:15:21.644 --> 00:15:24.340
he was so successful, historians seem

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:26.750
to suggest that it was principally a

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:29.716
question of strategy and technique.

00:15:30.068 --> 00:15:32.584
He wasn’t some kind of thrill-seeking

00:15:32.584 --> 00:15:35.564
and risky “Maverick” type figure in Top

00:15:35.564 --> 00:15:38.324
Gun. He didn’t engage in spectacular

00:15:38.544 --> 00:15:40.764
acrobatics or anything like that.

00:15:41.294 --> 00:15:43.474
He was very calm under pressure;

00:15:43.834 --> 00:15:45.594
he followed the guidebook as

00:15:45.594 --> 00:15:47.424
set out by Oswald Boelcke.

00:15:48.194 --> 00:15:50.304
He positioned his plane, making

00:15:50.304 --> 00:15:51.984
it difficult for the enemy to see

00:15:51.984 --> 00:15:54.074
him, he only fired when he was

00:15:54.074 --> 00:15:56.264
sure he would hit the target, and

00:15:56.394 --> 00:15:58.744
he retreated when it made sense.

00:15:59.234 --> 00:16:01.054
He did everything right.

00:16:01.984 --> 00:16:04.434
He was also a very good squadron

00:16:04.434 --> 00:16:07.514
leader, and knew how to motivate and

00:16:07.514 --> 00:16:09.454
instruct his men to work together

00:16:09.644 --> 00:16:11.944
when it made sense, and to split

00:16:12.014 --> 00:16:14.268
up when the conditions demanded it.

00:16:15.584 --> 00:16:19.429
By April of 1917, he surpassed

00:16:19.439 --> 00:16:21.959
his mentor’s total of 40 victories

00:16:22.299 --> 00:16:24.599
and became the most successful

00:16:24.639 --> 00:16:26.909
pilot in German military history.

00:16:28.219 --> 00:16:30.609
By this time, he had also taken the

00:16:30.609 --> 00:16:33.629
decision to paint his plane red, which

00:16:33.639 --> 00:16:36.199
had earned him the nickname of Der Rote

00:16:36.199 --> 00:16:39.259
Kampfflieger, or "the Red Fighter Pilot".

00:16:39.969 --> 00:16:41.659
Or, as he is now better

00:16:41.659 --> 00:16:43.449
known, “The Red Baron”.

00:16:44.189 --> 00:16:46.839
It’s not completely clear why he

00:16:46.839 --> 00:16:49.439
did this, but it’s been suggested by

00:16:49.439 --> 00:16:51.479
historians that it might have been

00:16:51.489 --> 00:16:54.199
similar to the way a medieval knight wore

00:16:54.199 --> 00:16:56.469
a particular kind of armour, as a way

00:16:56.469 --> 00:16:58.719
of singling him out on the battlefield.

00:16:59.519 --> 00:17:01.509
By this time, he was extremely

00:17:01.509 --> 00:17:04.029
confident of his own abilities, his

00:17:04.029 --> 00:17:05.939
name and his reputation were known

00:17:05.939 --> 00:17:08.899
to every Allied pilot, so perhaps

00:17:08.899 --> 00:17:11.069
this decision was a way of striking

00:17:11.069 --> 00:17:13.289
fear into the hearts of his enemies.

00:17:14.589 --> 00:17:16.949
If they saw a red plane coming

00:17:16.949 --> 00:17:18.819
up behind them, well, they

00:17:18.819 --> 00:17:20.499
knew what they were up against.

00:17:21.659 --> 00:17:23.559
And it wasn’t just The Red

00:17:23.579 --> 00:17:25.379
Baron who painted his plane.

00:17:25.999 --> 00:17:28.309
Several other members of his squadron

00:17:28.309 --> 00:17:30.489
did so too, and they earned the

00:17:30.489 --> 00:17:33.189
nickname “The Flying Circus” after

00:17:33.189 --> 00:17:35.329
their colourfully-painted planes and

00:17:35.559 --> 00:17:36.969
the fact that they would regularly be

00:17:36.969 --> 00:17:39.429
sent from place to place, as required.

00:17:40.399 --> 00:17:42.839
Von Richthofen was the leader of

00:17:42.839 --> 00:17:45.159
this legendary squadron, and was

00:17:45.169 --> 00:17:47.239
always up there in the skies,

00:17:47.489 --> 00:17:49.089
fighting alongside his men.

00:17:50.159 --> 00:17:52.419
But he was not invincible.

00:17:53.097 --> 00:17:56.807
In July of 1917, he was shot in the head

00:17:57.107 --> 00:17:58.867
during a fight with a British plane.

00:17:59.517 --> 00:18:02.077
He became dizzy and couldn’t see properly,

00:18:02.257 --> 00:18:04.437
and he lost control of his plane.

00:18:05.237 --> 00:18:07.167
It hurtled towards the ground,

00:18:07.467 --> 00:18:10.177
but fortunately, he regained his

00:18:10.177 --> 00:18:12.844
composure and managed to crash-land.

00:18:13.884 --> 00:18:16.614
Luckily, he was behind German lines.

00:18:17.404 --> 00:18:20.074
He was taken to hospital to recover, and

00:18:20.484 --> 00:18:23.044
after multiple operations, he declared

00:18:23.194 --> 00:18:25.174
that he was ready to return to action.

00:18:26.117 --> 00:18:27.943
The doctors said he was not.

00:18:28.743 --> 00:18:30.723
The injury had most likely

00:18:30.723 --> 00:18:33.460
caused lasting damage, but von

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:35.503
Richthofen was having none of it.

00:18:36.503 --> 00:18:38.333
He returned to active service

00:18:38.593 --> 00:18:40.303
less than three weeks after the

00:18:40.313 --> 00:18:43.563
injury, but something had changed.

00:18:44.203 --> 00:18:46.373
He had nausea and headaches

00:18:46.683 --> 00:18:48.073
and just didn’t feel the same.

00:18:49.263 --> 00:18:52.213
He took leave to recover and took

00:18:52.233 --> 00:18:54.053
this opportunity to write his

00:18:54.053 --> 00:18:56.738
biography, which he called Der rote

00:18:56.738 --> 00:18:59.633
Kampfflieger, or "The Red Fighter Pilot".

00:19:00.853 --> 00:19:02.673
Now, he seems to have been

00:19:02.673 --> 00:19:04.343
instructed to write this by his

00:19:04.343 --> 00:19:06.813
superiors as a propaganda tool.

00:19:07.963 --> 00:19:11.335
This was in September of 1917;

00:19:11.863 --> 00:19:13.623
the United States had joined the

00:19:13.623 --> 00:19:16.583
war earlier that year, and things

00:19:16.583 --> 00:19:18.063
were not going Germany’s way.

00:19:18.933 --> 00:19:21.753
Von Richthofen was Germany’s most famous

00:19:21.753 --> 00:19:24.662
fighter pilot, so what better way to

00:19:24.662 --> 00:19:27.362
boost morale than for the public to read

00:19:27.542 --> 00:19:29.812
about his heroic battles in the air?

00:19:31.012 --> 00:19:33.552
German high command even made efforts

00:19:33.722 --> 00:19:36.632
to stop him from going back into combat,

00:19:37.022 --> 00:19:39.742
fearing that if he was killed, this

00:19:39.742 --> 00:19:42.372
would be a great blow to national morale.

00:19:43.937 --> 00:19:46.437
Although von Richthofen had by this

00:19:46.437 --> 00:19:48.997
point spent two years in the air, and

00:19:49.207 --> 00:19:51.927
seen friends and colleagues die on

00:19:51.927 --> 00:19:54.827
an almost daily basis, he refused.

00:19:55.377 --> 00:19:57.097
It was his duty, he said;

00:19:57.427 --> 00:19:59.107
he would get back into the

00:19:59.117 --> 00:20:01.327
cockpit and take to the skies.

00:20:02.707 --> 00:20:05.447
And so he did, and his kill

00:20:05.457 --> 00:20:07.187
count continued to rise.

00:20:07.627 --> 00:20:11.407
60, 70, and on the 20th of April

00:20:11.587 --> 00:20:15.297
1918, he recorded his 79th and

00:20:15.297 --> 00:20:18.337
80th confirmed kills, more than

00:20:18.377 --> 00:20:20.477
doubling his mentor’s tally.

00:20:21.697 --> 00:20:23.717
Then, on the 21st of

00:20:23.717 --> 00:20:26.567
April, his luck ran out.

00:20:27.547 --> 00:20:28.627
He was flying with his

00:20:28.627 --> 00:20:30.627
squadron in Northern France.

00:20:31.397 --> 00:20:34.168
New to the squadron was Wolfram

00:20:34.168 --> 00:20:35.827
von Richthofen, his cousin.

00:20:37.118 --> 00:20:39.807
Wolfram was three years younger,

00:20:40.237 --> 00:20:42.777
and was an inexperienced fighter.

00:20:43.787 --> 00:20:46.387
Manfred, the squadron leader, had

00:20:46.417 --> 00:20:48.907
instructed his cousin to pull back

00:20:49.087 --> 00:20:51.357
if they encountered any enemy planes,

00:20:51.747 --> 00:20:54.797
and observe the action from above.

00:20:56.167 --> 00:20:57.937
Sure enough, the squadron

00:20:57.967 --> 00:20:59.637
came across a group of British

00:20:59.647 --> 00:21:01.767
fighter planes and engaged them.

00:21:03.437 --> 00:21:06.127
As he’d been told, Wolfram pulled

00:21:06.127 --> 00:21:08.627
his plane up and started to circle,

00:21:09.047 --> 00:21:11.287
observing the fight from up high.

00:21:12.647 --> 00:21:15.497
It just so happened that a young and

00:21:15.557 --> 00:21:18.547
inexperienced Canadian pilot, fighting

00:21:18.547 --> 00:21:21.757
on the Allied side, had been told exactly

00:21:21.757 --> 00:21:24.267
the same thing by his squadron leader.

00:21:25.737 --> 00:21:28.547
This Canadian, a man named Wilfrid

00:21:28.547 --> 00:21:31.017
May, saw the German plane in the

00:21:31.017 --> 00:21:33.837
air and decided to engage it.

00:21:35.037 --> 00:21:37.427
When Manfred looked up and saw his

00:21:37.447 --> 00:21:39.587
cousin in danger, he pulled his

00:21:39.597 --> 00:21:42.257
plane up and raced to the rescue.

00:21:43.309 --> 00:21:44.999
He managed to chase the Canadian

00:21:44.999 --> 00:21:48.069
plane away, but for some unknown

00:21:48.079 --> 00:21:50.829
reason, The Red Baron kept going.

00:21:51.429 --> 00:21:54.289
He followed May deep into Allied territory

00:21:54.519 --> 00:21:56.799
and came dangerously close to the ground.

00:21:57.759 --> 00:22:00.239
This was one of the things his mentor,

00:22:00.499 --> 00:22:03.219
Oswald Boelcke, had specifically detailed

00:22:03.439 --> 00:22:05.929
that a fighter pilot should not do.

00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:09.150
You should keep your composure, never

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:12.550
put yourself in unjustified danger, and

00:22:12.670 --> 00:22:15.950
always have a clear path to return home.

00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:19.750
Von Richthofen, the most successful

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:21.900
fighter pilot in the German military,

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:25.480
was breaking all the rules he lived by.

00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:29.680
As von Richthofen continued in pursuit,

00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:33.450
his plane suddenly stalled and tumbled to

00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:36.770
the ground, deep into Allied territory.

00:22:37.736 --> 00:22:40.066
The Allied forces rushed to the

00:22:40.066 --> 00:22:42.596
wreckage, and there they found

00:22:42.616 --> 00:22:44.966
a dead Manfred von Richthofen.

00:22:45.526 --> 00:22:47.516
He had been killed by a single

00:22:47.526 --> 00:22:49.256
bullet wound to the chest.

00:22:50.806 --> 00:22:53.026
To this day, it’s not clear

00:22:53.116 --> 00:22:54.906
exactly who killed him.

00:22:55.706 --> 00:22:57.946
It was first believed that this came

00:22:57.946 --> 00:23:00.556
from an enemy fighter plane, but it’s

00:23:00.566 --> 00:23:02.870
now believed to have come from ground

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:05.890
fire, either an anti-aircraft gun

00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:08.920
or a machine gun pointed to the sky.

00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:12.660
Whoever was ultimately responsible,

00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:14.850
the Red Baron was dead.

00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:17.960
He was the most deadly fighter in

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:20.090
the German airforce, responsible

00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:22.670
for dozens of Allied deaths, but

00:23:23.150 --> 00:23:25.070
in death, he was treated with

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:27.910
respect and dignity by his enemies.

00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:31.500
He was given a full military funeral,

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:33.520
with the men he had been chasing down

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:36.180
just hours before carrying his coffin.

00:23:37.512 --> 00:23:39.982
Ever since, historians have been

00:23:40.012 --> 00:23:41.962
puzzling over the details of his death.

00:23:43.132 --> 00:23:45.782
His decision to chase this enemy plane

00:23:46.002 --> 00:23:48.772
low over enemy territory went against

00:23:48.842 --> 00:23:51.452
everything he had been taught, and that he

00:23:51.452 --> 00:23:53.652
had drilled into the men in his squadron.

00:23:55.092 --> 00:23:56.992
Was it because he simply didn’t

00:23:56.992 --> 00:23:58.672
know that this was enemy territory?

00:23:59.479 --> 00:24:02.779
This was a period of flux during the war,

00:24:03.219 --> 00:24:06.409
and a combination of high winds and moving

00:24:06.409 --> 00:24:09.149
territorial boundaries might have meant

00:24:09.419 --> 00:24:11.235
he had gone much further than he thought

00:24:11.559 --> 00:24:14.439
and crossed into territory he thought was

00:24:14.439 --> 00:24:17.559
still under German control, but was not.

00:24:18.929 --> 00:24:21.539
Or was he simply not thinking straight?

00:24:22.459 --> 00:24:24.799
Had the head injury from the previous year

00:24:25.329 --> 00:24:27.869
impacted his judgment to such an extent

00:24:28.229 --> 00:24:30.889
that the composure and rationality that

00:24:30.889 --> 00:24:33.239
had kept him alive for so long was gone?

00:24:34.435 --> 00:24:36.455
We will never know, but his

00:24:36.455 --> 00:24:38.635
name is inscribed in legend.

00:24:39.505 --> 00:24:41.765
Loved by his colleagues, feared

00:24:42.045 --> 00:24:44.075
and respected by his enemies.

00:24:44.585 --> 00:24:46.845
His victory record has now been

00:24:46.845 --> 00:24:49.065
surpassed, but history will

00:24:49.105 --> 00:24:51.785
only remember one Red Baron.

00:24:53.535 --> 00:24:55.685
OK then, that is it for today's

00:24:55.685 --> 00:24:58.185
episode on Manfred von Richtofen.

00:24:58.523 --> 00:24:59.853
I hope it's been an interesting one,

00:25:00.143 --> 00:25:01.573
and that you’ve learned a little bit

00:25:01.573 --> 00:25:04.113
more about the man behind the title.

00:25:04.653 --> 00:25:06.623
As a quick reminder, in case you haven’t

00:25:06.623 --> 00:25:08.473
listened to them already, this was part

00:25:08.473 --> 00:25:10.703
three of our three-part mini-series on

00:25:10.763 --> 00:25:13.027
unusual characters from World War I.

00:25:13.403 --> 00:25:15.683
Part one was on Lawrence of Arabia,

00:25:15.863 --> 00:25:17.403
and part two was on Mata Hari.

00:25:17.813 --> 00:25:19.253
You can, of course, listen to them

00:25:19.273 --> 00:25:20.983
independently, but I hope that

00:25:20.983 --> 00:25:22.923
they make for a nice little trio.

00:25:23.913 --> 00:25:25.833
You've been listening to English Learning

00:25:25.833 --> 00:25:28.693
for Curious Minds by Leonardo English.

00:25:29.093 --> 00:25:32.003
I'm Alastair Budge, you stay safe, and

00:25:32.003 --> 00:25:34.283
I'll catch you in the next episode.
