Hello, hello, hello, and welcome

00:00:07.887 --> 00:00:09.797
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.797 --> 00:00:12.517
Minds, by Leonardo English, the show

00:00:12.517 --> 00:00:14.267
where you can listen to fascinating

00:00:14.267 --> 00:00:16.807
stories and learn weird and wonderful

00:00:16.817 --> 00:00:18.887
things about the world at the same

00:00:18.887 --> 00:00:20.827
time as improving your English.

00:00:21.287 --> 00:00:24.277
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are

00:00:24.287 --> 00:00:27.197
going to be talking about carbon removal.

00:00:27.547 --> 00:00:28.927
It’s a story about climate

00:00:28.927 --> 00:00:31.287
change, technology, chemistry,

00:00:31.607 --> 00:00:33.387
economics and market dynamics,

00:00:33.497 --> 00:00:35.407
and the future of the planet.

00:00:36.007 --> 00:00:37.477
It is also, although you

00:00:37.477 --> 00:00:39.547
might not know it, about you.

00:00:40.157 --> 00:00:42.317
A tiny proportion of the world’s

00:00:42.317 --> 00:00:44.637
population has contributed to

00:00:44.677 --> 00:00:47.757
global carbon removal, but you, if

00:00:47.757 --> 00:00:49.317
you are listening to this episode,

00:00:49.527 --> 00:00:51.327
are in that special category.

00:00:51.767 --> 00:00:53.697
Don’t worry, I will explain it all

00:00:53.707 --> 00:00:56.277
in a few minutes, so let’s get right

00:00:56.297 --> 00:00:59.097
into it and talk about carbon removal.

00:01:00.357 --> 00:01:03.297
Spending too much time reading articles

00:01:03.307 --> 00:01:05.347
in the newspaper about climate change

00:01:05.657 --> 00:01:08.297
can quickly make you pretty depressed.

00:01:08.877 --> 00:01:12.007
Week after week, month after month, year

00:01:12.037 --> 00:01:14.927
after year, there are scientists warning

00:01:14.927 --> 00:01:17.587
us that the planet is heading for a

00:01:17.637 --> 00:01:20.967
climate catastrophe, and despite every

00:01:21.007 --> 00:01:24.237
congress, conference, or global agreement

00:01:24.487 --> 00:01:26.637
promising to do everything to reduce

00:01:26.687 --> 00:01:30.457
carbon emissions, overall, we as a planet,

00:01:30.647 --> 00:01:34.027
as a species, keep on missing our goals.

00:01:34.897 --> 00:01:38.567
Most recently, in the 2016 Paris

00:01:38.597 --> 00:01:42.887
Agreement, 195 countries pledged to

00:01:42.887 --> 00:01:44.737
make sure that the global temperature

00:01:44.907 --> 00:01:47.697
is no more than 2°C higher than

00:01:47.727 --> 00:01:50.777
pre-industrial levels, and “preferably”,

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.362
it should be kept below 1.5°C higher.

00:01:55.392 --> 00:01:59.192
Last year, in 2024, the average

00:01:59.192 --> 00:02:03.232
temperature was more than 1.5°C above

00:02:03.432 --> 00:02:06.232
pre-industrial levels, meaning that just

00:02:06.312 --> 00:02:09.452
8 years after this supposedly landmark

00:02:09.492 --> 00:02:11.642
global agreement was signed, we have

00:02:11.642 --> 00:02:13.842
already missed one of the targets.

00:02:14.682 --> 00:02:17.192
And, at the risk of sounding even

00:02:17.192 --> 00:02:20.152
more glum and gloomy, scientists

00:02:20.332 --> 00:02:22.532
are almost unanimous in their

00:02:22.532 --> 00:02:24.942
conclusion that it is getting worse.

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.549
According to one article last year,

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:31.799
a rise of 1.6°C is the absolute

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:34.789
best we can hope for, and this would

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:37.489
still require vast behavioural and

00:02:37.499 --> 00:02:40.049
structural changes in our society.

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:43.779
And while many developed countries

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:46.559
have done a pretty good job at reducing

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:48.739
their emissions, many developing

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.319
countries are still at the very early

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:53.759
stages of their “carbon journey”.

00:02:54.899 --> 00:02:58.739
China produces more CO2 than all of Europe

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:02.179
and the USA combined, and its rate of

00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:05.519
CO2 emissions shows no sign of slowing.

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:08.849
Even on a per capita basis, the

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:12.259
average person in China emits 90%

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:14.949
more CO2 than someone in the UK.

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:18.269
And yes, there is the perfectly reasonable

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:21.199
comeback to this that this isn’t personal

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:24.059
consumption, but taking into account CO2

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:26.859
production from manufacturing and so on.

00:03:27.529 --> 00:03:30.749
So, for every person feeling smug about

00:03:30.749 --> 00:03:33.409
their “zero emission” electric car in

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:36.239
London or Paris or Madrid, there might

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.769
not be black smoke coming out of your

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:42.209
exhaust pipe, but producing that car did

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.759
result in lots of CO2 emissions, they just

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:46.719
happened on the other side of the world.

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:51.279
But without getting into the intricacies

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:53.699
of who is responsible for carbon

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:56.379
emissions or trying to point fingers

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:59.219
at individuals or countries, climate

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:02.689
change is a fundamentally global problem.

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:05.809
It knows no borders; it affects

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:08.599
everyone, albeit in different ways.

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:11.659
And while, at least in most of the

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:14.169
media, the attention has been focussed

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:17.539
on reducing carbon emissions–of flying

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:20.439
less, of eating less meat, of living

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.199
as sustainably as possible–there is

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:25.919
a flip side, another important part

00:04:26.059 --> 00:04:27.729
of reducing the amount of carbon in

00:04:27.739 --> 00:04:30.349
the atmosphere and therefore reducing

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:32.259
the rise of global temperatures.

00:04:33.239 --> 00:04:36.719
And that is to remove the carbon that has

00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:39.489
already been released into the atmosphere.

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:42.599
At the risk of sounding like a

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:45.009
school geography teacher, I want

00:04:45.019 --> 00:04:47.339
to pause briefly to address a

00:04:47.339 --> 00:04:49.769
few basic but important points.

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:54.029
The planet has a natural carbon cycle.

00:04:54.559 --> 00:04:57.929
Carbon moves through the land, the oceans,

00:04:58.209 --> 00:05:00.629
the air, and every living thing on Earth,

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:03.799
and it has done so for millions of years.

00:05:04.489 --> 00:05:07.039
Plants and trees absorb carbon

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:09.909
dioxide from the air and store it in

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:12.549
their leaves, roots, and the soil.

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:16.299
Tiny marine organisms, like plankton, also

00:05:16.299 --> 00:05:18.419
take in carbon dioxide from the water.

00:05:19.329 --> 00:05:22.149
Some carbon is also released naturally.

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:25.829
For example, when a volcano erupts, it

00:05:25.829 --> 00:05:28.269
sends carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

00:05:28.549 --> 00:05:30.299
Burning wood does the same.

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:33.289
And animals, including us,

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:36.119
good old humans, we emit carbon

00:05:36.119 --> 00:05:37.879
dioxide when we breathe out.

00:05:38.489 --> 00:05:40.929
When we die, the carbon in our bodies

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:43.499
is also returned to the environment.

00:05:44.059 --> 00:05:46.359
And for a long time, this

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:49.169
carbon cycle was in balance.

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:52.219
The amount of carbon dioxide released

00:05:52.239 --> 00:05:54.619
into the atmosphere was more or

00:05:54.619 --> 00:05:56.919
less equal to the amount that was

00:05:56.929 --> 00:06:00.479
absorbed by plants, oceans, and soil.

00:06:00.959 --> 00:06:03.199
But starting around the time of

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:05.539
the Industrial Revolution, we began

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:08.639
burning fossil fuels — coal, oil,

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:11.378
and natural gas — and we did so

00:06:11.608 --> 00:06:14.428
and still do so on a massive scale.

00:06:15.018 --> 00:06:17.408
This, as you know, releases

00:06:17.418 --> 00:06:19.428
huge amounts of extra carbon

00:06:19.428 --> 00:06:20.978
dioxide into the atmosphere.

00:06:21.718 --> 00:06:23.958
We began emitting more CO2

00:06:24.278 --> 00:06:25.718
than the Earth could absorb.

00:06:26.188 --> 00:06:28.288
And almost every year since

00:06:28.288 --> 00:06:30.908
then, the amount has increased.

00:06:31.688 --> 00:06:35.018
So now, almost 200 years later,

00:06:35.478 --> 00:06:39.128
there are more than 3,000 gigatons

00:06:39.128 --> 00:06:41.108
of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

00:06:41.768 --> 00:06:44.908
A gigaton is a billion metric tonnes.

00:06:45.518 --> 00:06:49.178
And if 3,000 billion tonnes of an

00:06:49.188 --> 00:06:51.838
invisible gas is hard to imagine,

00:06:52.308 --> 00:06:54.558
the key point is this: it’s an

00:06:54.608 --> 00:06:58.188
increase of 50% compared to the

00:06:58.198 --> 00:07:00.428
start of the Industrial Revolution.

00:07:01.928 --> 00:07:04.168
And this carbon dioxide in the

00:07:04.168 --> 00:07:06.396
atmosphere acts like a kind

00:07:06.396 --> 00:07:08.346
of blanket around the Earth.

00:07:08.596 --> 00:07:10.536
It traps heat from the sun, which

00:07:10.556 --> 00:07:12.546
causes global temperatures to rise.

00:07:13.086 --> 00:07:15.016
Clearly, that is a gross

00:07:15.096 --> 00:07:18.136
simplification, but it helps bring

00:07:18.136 --> 00:07:20.596
us to the next point, which is this.

00:07:21.746 --> 00:07:24.096
Given that there is all of this carbon

00:07:24.096 --> 00:07:26.796
dioxide in the atmosphere, and carbon

00:07:26.796 --> 00:07:29.886
dioxide causes global heating, and global

00:07:29.896 --> 00:07:32.996
heating is bad, what would happen if

00:07:32.996 --> 00:07:35.636
we could “remove” the carbon dioxide?

00:07:37.066 --> 00:07:39.176
This is the principle behind

00:07:39.246 --> 00:07:42.256
carbon removal: to work on removing

00:07:42.266 --> 00:07:44.469
carbon dioxide from the planet.

00:07:45.086 --> 00:07:47.006
So, what's happening?

00:07:47.006 --> 00:07:49.746
What does carbon removal actually involve?

00:07:49.986 --> 00:07:52.256
And how does one go about removing

00:07:52.266 --> 00:07:54.296
carbon dioxide from the atmosphere?

00:07:55.166 --> 00:07:57.106
Well, the good news is

00:07:57.106 --> 00:07:58.346
that we know how to do it.

00:07:59.276 --> 00:08:02.676
The bad news is that it’s hard, expensive,

00:08:02.996 --> 00:08:05.676
and still in its very early stages.

00:08:07.056 --> 00:08:09.656
Broadly speaking, carbon removal

00:08:09.656 --> 00:08:12.466
technologies aim to do exactly what

00:08:12.476 --> 00:08:15.626
trees and oceans do naturally: take in

00:08:15.686 --> 00:08:18.706
carbon dioxide and store it somewhere

00:08:18.706 --> 00:08:20.816
safe and out of the atmosphere.

00:08:22.106 --> 00:08:25.376
Some approaches aim to speed up natural

00:08:25.376 --> 00:08:27.566
processes like mineral weathering,

00:08:27.786 --> 00:08:30.566
where rocks slowly react with carbon

00:08:30.566 --> 00:08:33.586
dioxide and trap it in solid form.

00:08:34.386 --> 00:08:36.556
Others are more technological;

00:08:36.826 --> 00:08:38.886
machines that literally suck

00:08:39.166 --> 00:08:41.036
carbon dioxide directly out of

00:08:41.046 --> 00:08:43.106
the air and store it underground.

00:08:43.826 --> 00:08:46.816
Some store carbon in soil or plants,

00:08:46.986 --> 00:08:49.546
others inject it into rock formations,

00:08:49.776 --> 00:08:52.736
and a few even store it in the ocean.

00:08:54.276 --> 00:08:56.906
One of the most talked-about is something

00:08:56.906 --> 00:09:00.236
called direct air capture, where large

00:09:00.256 --> 00:09:03.166
machines act like giant air filters,

00:09:03.625 --> 00:09:07.275
pulling in huge volumes of air and using

00:09:07.275 --> 00:09:10.775
chemical processes to extract the CO2.

00:09:11.565 --> 00:09:13.725
Once it’s captured, the carbon is

00:09:13.755 --> 00:09:16.995
compressed and injected deep underground,

00:09:17.155 --> 00:09:19.365
where it can stay for thousands of years.

00:09:20.445 --> 00:09:23.335
Then there’s this thing called enhanced

00:09:23.355 --> 00:09:25.832
weathering, where crushed rocks are

00:09:25.862 --> 00:09:28.882
spread onto farmland or coastlines.

00:09:29.552 --> 00:09:32.182
These rocks naturally react with

00:09:32.192 --> 00:09:34.852
carbon dioxide in the air or water,

00:09:35.332 --> 00:09:37.222
forming stable compounds that

00:09:37.232 --> 00:09:38.672
are eventually washed into the

00:09:38.692 --> 00:09:41.979
ocean and stored as bicarbonate.

00:09:43.092 --> 00:09:45.372
Another promising method is something

00:09:45.372 --> 00:09:48.512
called biomass carbon removal and storage.

00:09:49.512 --> 00:09:52.202
This includes things like burning plant

00:09:52.232 --> 00:09:55.132
waste to generate energy, capturing the

00:09:55.132 --> 00:09:57.682
carbon that’s released, and storing it

00:09:57.772 --> 00:10:00.742
underground, essentially closing the loop.

00:10:01.492 --> 00:10:04.212
There are other approaches too: turning

00:10:04.252 --> 00:10:07.412
biomass into bio-oil and injecting it

00:10:07.432 --> 00:10:10.029
underground, using chemical processes

00:10:10.072 --> 00:10:11.952
in the ocean to increase its carbon

00:10:11.952 --> 00:10:15.722
absorption, or even sinking agricultural

00:10:15.722 --> 00:10:18.002
waste to the bottom of oxygen-poor

00:10:18.012 --> 00:10:20.652
seas, where it breaks down very slowly

00:10:20.652 --> 00:10:23.152
and locks away carbon in sediment.

00:10:24.072 --> 00:10:26.592
It all sounds promising in theory,

00:10:27.142 --> 00:10:30.242
and even in practice, most of these

00:10:30.242 --> 00:10:32.642
technologies work pretty well.

00:10:33.332 --> 00:10:35.252
But there is a problem.

00:10:35.922 --> 00:10:39.002
They are still expensive, and as of

00:10:39.012 --> 00:10:41.682
now, they haven’t been deployed anywhere

00:10:41.712 --> 00:10:44.352
close to the scale that is required.

00:10:45.452 --> 00:10:49.492
To remove just 1% of global annual

00:10:49.502 --> 00:10:52.102
emissions, we’d need to capture around

00:10:52.102 --> 00:10:55.472
400 million tonnes of CO₂ per year.

00:10:56.302 --> 00:10:59.042
Today, the total removed by these

00:10:59.072 --> 00:11:01.782
carbon removal technologies is only

00:11:02.002 --> 00:11:04.702
about 2 million tonnes — that’s

00:11:04.892 --> 00:11:09.252
just 0.005% of global emissions.

00:11:09.882 --> 00:11:12.012
In other words, we’re only half

00:11:12.072 --> 00:11:15.405
a percent of the way to just 1%.

00:11:16.562 --> 00:11:19.512
And carbon removal is a classic

00:11:19.522 --> 00:11:22.162
victim of the chicken and egg problem.

00:11:23.192 --> 00:11:25.072
Because there aren’t many customers,

00:11:25.402 --> 00:11:27.942
the cost of carbon removal is still

00:11:27.952 --> 00:11:30.209
very high, often many hundreds

00:11:30.209 --> 00:11:32.349
of dollars per tonne of CO2.

00:11:33.209 --> 00:11:34.769
And because the cost is high,

00:11:35.199 --> 00:11:36.619
there aren’t many customers.

00:11:37.859 --> 00:11:40.276
In other words, it’s hard to lower the

00:11:40.296 --> 00:11:43.296
cost without customers, but hard to

00:11:43.306 --> 00:11:46.086
get customers when the cost is so high

00:11:47.106 --> 00:11:50.456
But history is full of examples

00:11:50.596 --> 00:11:52.446
where this cycle was broken.

00:11:53.364 --> 00:11:54.824
The first computers were

00:11:54.834 --> 00:11:57.324
massive and cost millions.

00:11:57.644 --> 00:11:59.924
The first hard drives could store

00:11:59.954 --> 00:12:02.884
a few megabytes but cost a fortune.

00:12:03.554 --> 00:12:05.734
Vaccines, solar panels,

00:12:06.114 --> 00:12:08.624
smartphones–they all started out

00:12:08.654 --> 00:12:11.884
very expensive, slow, and niche.

00:12:12.504 --> 00:12:16.474
But as technology improved and demand

00:12:16.544 --> 00:12:20.094
grew, prices fell dramatically.

00:12:21.194 --> 00:12:23.254
In the case of solar panels,

00:12:23.544 --> 00:12:27.666
the cost has fallen by 99.6%

00:12:27.764 --> 00:12:29.244
since they were first developed.

00:12:30.244 --> 00:12:32.754
A similar thing could happen with

00:12:32.784 --> 00:12:36.034
carbon removal, but it needs investment.

00:12:36.694 --> 00:12:38.604
These technologies and companies

00:12:38.934 --> 00:12:41.734
need customers to buy from them, so

00:12:41.734 --> 00:12:43.964
they can invest and improve their

00:12:44.034 --> 00:12:45.914
technology and methods, so they can

00:12:45.914 --> 00:12:48.074
bring costs down and be more efficient,

00:12:48.344 --> 00:12:50.664
so there are more customers, and so on.

00:12:51.284 --> 00:12:53.524
And that’s where you come in.

00:12:54.714 --> 00:12:56.784
You might not have noticed this, but

00:12:57.174 --> 00:12:59.464
we have a little thing on our website

00:12:59.514 --> 00:13:02.764
and on receipts which says, “Leonardo

00:13:02.764 --> 00:13:06.124
English contributes 1% of your purchase

00:13:06.434 --> 00:13:09.104
to remove CO2 from the atmosphere”.

00:13:10.524 --> 00:13:13.454
This doesn’t pay for me to buy a train

00:13:13.454 --> 00:13:16.364
ticket to scatter crushed rocks on a beach

00:13:16.414 --> 00:13:18.714
or to go and plant trees in a forest.

00:13:19.354 --> 00:13:21.154
The payment processor that

00:13:21.154 --> 00:13:23.014
we use is called Stripe.

00:13:23.474 --> 00:13:24.964
It’s one of the biggest payment

00:13:24.964 --> 00:13:26.990
processors in the world, and

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.750
it has quite a cool non-profit

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:32.630
initiative called Stripe Climate.

00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:35.830
You can literally just switch on a

00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:39.270
setting and divert a percentage of

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:41.700
all payments towards this initiative.

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:45.315
Yes, it’s small, and this is a tiny

00:13:45.315 --> 00:13:46.994
business in the grand scheme of

00:13:46.994 --> 00:13:49.274
things, but it's better than nothing.

00:13:49.794 --> 00:13:52.794
So I wanted to tell you a little bit

00:13:52.814 --> 00:13:55.274
about this initiative, firstly because

00:13:55.274 --> 00:13:57.434
I think it's very cool and potentially

00:13:57.434 --> 00:14:00.764
important, and secondly because as

00:14:00.764 --> 00:14:02.944
a member, you have supported it,

00:14:03.294 --> 00:14:04.814
even if you might not have known it.

00:14:05.654 --> 00:14:09.144
Stripe Climate operates under an umbrella

00:14:09.384 --> 00:14:12.134
called Frontier, which is something called

00:14:12.154 --> 00:14:15.624
an “Advance Market Commitment” and is

00:14:15.624 --> 00:14:19.244
a big project between Stripe, Alphabet

00:14:19.364 --> 00:14:22.084
[which is the company behind Google], Meta

00:14:22.274 --> 00:14:24.664
[which is the company behind Facebook] and

00:14:24.814 --> 00:14:27.214
a few other large technology companies.

00:14:28.394 --> 00:14:31.234
The idea behind this initiative is to

00:14:31.234 --> 00:14:34.014
solve this “chicken and egg” problem.

00:14:35.274 --> 00:14:37.334
It brings together large companies

00:14:37.614 --> 00:14:39.814
that can guarantee that they will

00:14:39.824 --> 00:14:42.354
buy carbon removal technologies from

00:14:42.354 --> 00:14:44.244
promising companies so that they

00:14:44.244 --> 00:14:46.414
can invest in building and scaling

00:14:46.414 --> 00:14:49.074
their technologies now, rather

00:14:49.074 --> 00:14:50.614
than waiting for other customers to

00:14:50.614 --> 00:14:52.964
arrive, which might never happen.

00:14:54.514 --> 00:14:56.524
And they are backing some pretty

00:14:56.524 --> 00:14:59.004
cool projects, so I wanted to tell

00:14:59.014 --> 00:15:01.114
you about a few of them that your

00:15:01.114 --> 00:15:03.264
support has helped make possible.

00:15:04.484 --> 00:15:07.234
Firstly, there’s one called Eion,

00:15:07.544 --> 00:15:09.364
which is a company that works

00:15:09.364 --> 00:15:11.834
with farmers to mix a specially

00:15:11.834 --> 00:15:14.434
developed silicate rock into soil.

00:15:15.604 --> 00:15:18.134
This rock reacts with carbon

00:15:18.134 --> 00:15:21.004
dioxide in the air and eventually

00:15:21.254 --> 00:15:23.004
turns it into a stable form of

00:15:23.004 --> 00:15:25.154
carbon that ends up in the ocean.

00:15:26.074 --> 00:15:28.834
It’s a natural process, but Eion is

00:15:28.844 --> 00:15:31.694
speeding it up, and they’re also helping

00:15:31.694 --> 00:15:34.044
improve soil quality at the same time.

00:15:35.024 --> 00:15:38.104
Another one is called Phlair, which uses

00:15:38.104 --> 00:15:41.814
a process called electrochemical pH-swing.

00:15:42.614 --> 00:15:45.224
It might sound technical, but essentially,

00:15:45.514 --> 00:15:48.173
it captures carbon dioxide from the air

00:15:48.564 --> 00:15:51.694
using a chemical solvent, then permanently

00:15:51.904 --> 00:15:54.214
stores the carbon in construction

00:15:54.214 --> 00:15:56.984
materials, like bricks or concrete,

00:15:57.374 --> 00:15:59.954
so it never returns to the atmosphere.

00:16:00.914 --> 00:16:02.494
Then there’s one with the

00:16:02.594 --> 00:16:05.254
ominous name of Vaulted Deep.

00:16:05.834 --> 00:16:08.434
Maybe it sounds like a horror film, or

00:16:08.554 --> 00:16:11.694
someone’s gaming name, but it's a company

00:16:11.694 --> 00:16:14.554
that basically buries food underground.

00:16:15.334 --> 00:16:16.654
Obviously, it’s a little

00:16:16.654 --> 00:16:18.104
more complicated than this.

00:16:18.394 --> 00:16:20.414
It takes organic waste, things

00:16:20.414 --> 00:16:23.084
like food scraps and agricultural

00:16:23.094 --> 00:16:25.834
leftovers, and injects it deep

00:16:25.874 --> 00:16:28.504
underground in specially built wells.

00:16:29.314 --> 00:16:31.234
As it decomposes, the

00:16:31.254 --> 00:16:33.454
carbon stays locked away.

00:16:34.104 --> 00:16:36.824
Not only does this stop carbon from

00:16:36.844 --> 00:16:39.744
entering the atmosphere, but it solves

00:16:39.744 --> 00:16:43.004
the problem of environmental waste, and it

00:16:43.004 --> 00:16:45.614
doesn’t require fancy new infrastructure.

00:16:46.524 --> 00:16:48.574
And finally, there’s a project

00:16:48.754 --> 00:16:51.034
close to home, at least where I am.

00:16:51.674 --> 00:16:54.474
There’s a Swedish company called Exergi,

00:16:54.814 --> 00:16:57.184
and it’s another nice example of how

00:16:57.184 --> 00:17:00.024
this technology sometimes seems obvious.

00:17:01.384 --> 00:17:04.384
What it is doing is retrofitting a

00:17:04.424 --> 00:17:06.494
biomass power plant in Stockholm.

00:17:07.484 --> 00:17:10.694
This biomass power plant already takes

00:17:10.734 --> 00:17:13.344
waste products from the timber industry,

00:17:13.624 --> 00:17:16.354
such as sawdust, branches, and wood,

00:17:16.654 --> 00:17:19.604
then burns them to generate electricity

00:17:19.674 --> 00:17:20.987
for people living in Stockholm.

00:17:21.394 --> 00:17:24.714
But what this company is doing is

00:17:24.784 --> 00:17:27.364
adapting the power plant so that the

00:17:27.364 --> 00:17:30.764
CO2 generated during this process is

00:17:30.834 --> 00:17:33.234
captured before it’s released into

00:17:33.234 --> 00:17:36.184
the atmosphere, then transporting it

00:17:36.214 --> 00:17:38.904
away and burying it deep underground.

00:17:39.954 --> 00:17:42.494
It’s a nice example because it is a

00:17:42.504 --> 00:17:44.934
mixture between carbon removal and

00:17:45.074 --> 00:17:48.194
emission reduction, and also shows

00:17:48.204 --> 00:17:50.314
how these technologies aren’t always

00:17:50.314 --> 00:17:52.454
rocket science; they just need enough

00:17:52.464 --> 00:17:54.724
people to believe in them so they can be

00:17:54.724 --> 00:17:57.844
scaled and deployed on a global basis.

00:17:58.984 --> 00:18:01.774
And these are just a few of the dozens

00:18:01.774 --> 00:18:04.074
of companies working on this challenge.

00:18:04.454 --> 00:18:06.894
I’ll put a link in the description to

00:18:06.894 --> 00:18:09.474
the Stripe Climate website, so you can

00:18:09.474 --> 00:18:11.214
go and check out some of these companies

00:18:11.314 --> 00:18:13.424
if you are interested; there are some

00:18:13.424 --> 00:18:15.691
really cool ideas and projects in there.

00:18:16.354 --> 00:18:19.074
Some will fail, some will succeed,

00:18:19.504 --> 00:18:21.364
and there’s a real challenge

00:18:21.374 --> 00:18:24.414
in verifying and monitoring how

00:18:24.414 --> 00:18:26.444
much carbon is truly removed.

00:18:27.094 --> 00:18:29.974
But all of them are helping build

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:32.662
the foundations for what might one

00:18:32.662 --> 00:18:35.172
day be a massive global industry.

00:18:36.122 --> 00:18:39.666
So, can carbon removal save the planet?

00:18:40.302 --> 00:18:42.302
No, not by itself.

00:18:42.902 --> 00:18:45.462
But alongside reducing emissions,

00:18:45.732 --> 00:18:48.232
switching to clean energy, protecting

00:18:48.232 --> 00:18:50.892
forests, and changing how we live

00:18:50.892 --> 00:18:52.881
and work, it’s one of the tools

00:18:52.891 --> 00:18:55.071
we’ll need to have a fighting chance.

00:18:55.803 --> 00:18:58.787
And thanks to you, one of the relatively

00:18:58.787 --> 00:19:01.407
few people on this planet who has helped

00:19:01.407 --> 00:19:04.387
fund real carbon removal, that future

00:19:04.586 --> 00:19:07.577
perhaps looks just a tiny bit brighter.

00:19:08.827 --> 00:19:11.087
OK then, that is it for carbon

00:19:11.087 --> 00:19:12.897
removal, this fascinating and

00:19:12.907 --> 00:19:14.587
vastly important technology.

00:19:14.847 --> 00:19:16.267
I hope it's been an interesting one

00:19:16.547 --> 00:19:18.127
and that you've learnt something new.

00:19:18.632 --> 00:19:20.399
As always, I would love to know

00:19:20.399 --> 00:19:21.739
what you thought of this episode.

00:19:22.139 --> 00:19:24.319
Firstly, did you notice that little

00:19:24.339 --> 00:19:25.929
piece of text about “removing

00:19:25.929 --> 00:19:27.819
CO2” when you became a member?

00:19:28.419 --> 00:19:30.839
I imagine most people don’t notice it, or

00:19:31.019 --> 00:19:33.259
if they do, they are a bit confused about

00:19:33.259 --> 00:19:35.719
what it means, but I’d be curious to know.

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:38.747
And secondly, how does knowing about

00:19:38.757 --> 00:19:41.117
these kinds of technologies make you feel?

00:19:41.497 --> 00:19:43.757
Excited, nervous for the future,

00:19:44.177 --> 00:19:46.607
or perhaps that it’s a distraction

00:19:46.637 --> 00:19:48.607
from the bigger problem of reducing

00:19:48.617 --> 00:19:50.027
our emissions in the first place?

00:19:50.497 --> 00:19:52.387
I would love to know, so let’s

00:19:52.387 --> 00:19:53.747
get this discussion started.

00:19:54.017 --> 00:19:55.137
You can head right into our

00:19:55.137 --> 00:19:56.907
community forum, which is at

00:19:56.907 --> 00:19:59.627
community.leonardoenglish.com and get

00:19:59.627 --> 00:20:01.837
chatting away to other curious minds.

00:20:02.647 --> 00:20:04.597
You've been listening to English Learning

00:20:04.597 --> 00:20:07.377
